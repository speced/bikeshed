<h3 id="conventions" class="no-ref no-num">Document conventions</h3>

    <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
    descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
    “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
    “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
    However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
    letters in this specification.

    <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
    explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

    <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
    or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
    like this:

    <div class="example">
        <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
    normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

    <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

    <wpt open title="Tests relating to the content of this specification
                     may be documented in “Tests” blocks like this one.
                     Any such block is non-normative."></wpt>

<h3 id="conformant-algorithms" class="no-ref no-num">Conformant Algorithms</h3>

    <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
    "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
    steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must",
    "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
    be easy to understand and are not intended to be performant. Implementers
    are encouraged to optimize.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes" class="no-ref no-num">Conformance Classes</h3>

    <p>A <dfn export>conformant user agent</dfn> must implement all the requirements
    listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.</p>

    <p>A <dfn export>conformant server</dfn> must implement all the requirements listed
    in this specification that are applicable to servers.</p>
