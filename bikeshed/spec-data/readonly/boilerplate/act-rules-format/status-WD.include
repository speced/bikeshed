<p>This is a First Public Working Draft of Accessibility Conformance Testing Framework 1.0 (ACT Framework 1.0) by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a>. ACT Framework 1.0 is a complete draft, addressing all of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-fr-reqs.html">requirements</a> the ACT Task Force believes are important to cover when writing rules. The ACT Framework is based on rules developed by the <a href="https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/">Auto-WCAG Community Group</a>.</p>

<p>For this publication, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group particularly seeks feedback on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the ACT Framework address all the topics that are critical to rule design?</li>
  <li>Does the <a href="#structure-acc-supp">section on accessibility support</a> adequately address the topic?</li>
  <li>Does the <a href="#quality-accuracy">section on Accuracy Benchmarking</a> adequately address the topic?</li>
  <li>Are there improvements to better support developers of test rules to transpose their rules and adopt this framework?</li>
</ul>
