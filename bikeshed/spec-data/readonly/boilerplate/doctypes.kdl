/*
This is a KDL document listing all the Org/Group/Status "metadata" values.

An "org" node defines an organization, which can have default boilerplates (overriding the bikeshed defaults) and its own set of Group and Status metadatas.
* Required: a string attribute,
    giving the org name/abbreviation
    (what you write in the Org metadata)
* Required: one or more "group" children
* Required: one or more "status" children

"org" nodes must live at the top level.


A "group" node defines a group in the org, which can have its own boilerplates (overriding the org defaults)
* Required: a string attribute,
    giving the group name/abbreviation
    (what you write in the Group metadata)
* Optional: a "priv-sec" property with a boolean value,
    indicating whether the group requires privacy/security consideration sections.
* Optional: a "type" property with a string value,
    giving an org-specific "type" for the group,
    which can restrict what statuses the group is allowed to use.
    (If omitted, this group can use any status in the org.)
* Optional: a "requires" child node,
    containing string attributes listing metadatas that are required for documents in this group.

"group" nodes can only exist underneath an org.


A "status" node defines a document status, which can also have its own boilerplates (overriding the non-status-specialized version).
* Required: a string attribute,
    giving the status name/abbreviation
    (what you write in the Status metadata)
* Required: a string attribute,
    giving the human-readable status name
    (what's stored in the `[LONGSTATUS]` macro)
* Optional: a "requires" child node,
    identical to the one in "group" nodes
    (the two lists are merged if a doc knows both its Group and Status).
* Optional: a "group-types" child node,
    containing string attributes listing the group types allowed to use this status.
    (If omitted, the status is usable by any group in the org.)

Status nodes can exist underneath an org,
but can also live at the top level,
indicating statuses usable regardless of your org.

Note: casing of the org/group/status shortnames is not relevant;
they're canonically uppercased by Bikeshed,
and any casing can be used in the metadata.
For any other data, casing is preserved.
