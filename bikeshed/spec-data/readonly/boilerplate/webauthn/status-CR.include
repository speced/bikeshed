    For the Web Authentication specification to move to Proposed Recommendation we must show two independent, interoperable
    implementations of the Web Authentication API in browsers. We will also have multiple interoperable implementations of the AppID
    extension, validating the extensions framework. All other extensions are "at risk". If there are not multiple interoperable
    implementations, each may independently be removed or made informative at Proposed Recommendation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have had two informal interoperability tests with implementations in three browsers. There is no preliminary implementation
    report at this time.
