	This is a <strong>really</strong> unofficial draft.
	It's not meant to capture any consensus,
	beyond my own personal feelings about what sounds interesting.
	It is provided for discussion only and may change at any moment,
	and should not be taken as "official" or even "unofficial, but planned".
	Its publication here does not imply endorsement of its contents by W3C. 
	Don't cite this document other than as a collection of interesting ideas.
