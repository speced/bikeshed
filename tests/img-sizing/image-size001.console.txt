LINE 27: The width (333px) of this image is not a multiple of the declared resolution (2): test2.png
Consider fixing the image so its width is a multiple of the resolution, or setting its 'width' and 'height' attribute manually.
LINE 29: The height (220px) of this image is not a multiple of the declared resolution (3): test2.png
Consider fixing the image so its height is a multiple of the resolution, or setting its 'width' and 'height' attribute manually.
LINE 31: Autodetection of image dimensions is only supported for local files, skipping this image: <img bs-line-number="31" alt="Remote image" src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150">
Consider setting 'width' and 'height' manually or opting out of autodetection by setting the 'no-autosize' attribute.
LINE 33: Image doesn't exist, so I couldn't determine its width and height: 'file/not/found.png'
LINE 35: <img> elements must have at least one of src or srcset.
LINE 37: Couldn't parse 'srcset' attribute: "test.png 1x, test2.png 2x"
Bikeshed only supports a single image followed by an integer resolution. If not targeting Bikeshed specifically, HTML requires a 'src' attribute (and probably a 'width' and 'height' attribute too). This warning can also be suppressed by adding a 'no-autosize' attribute.
