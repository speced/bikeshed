WARNING: The width (333px) of this image is not a multiple of the declared resolution (2): test2.png
Consider fixing the image so its width is a multiple of the resolution, or setting its 'width' and 'height' attribute manually.
WARNING: The height (220px) of this image is not a multiple of the declared resolution (3): test2.png
Consider fixing the image so its height is a multiple of the resolution, or setting its 'width' and 'height' attribute manually.
WARNING: Autodetection of image dimensions is only supported for local files, skipping this image: <img bs-line-number="31" alt="Remote image" src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150">
Consider setting 'width' and 'height' manually or opting out of autodetection by setting the 'no-autosize' attribute.
WARNING: Couldn't determine width and height of this image: file/not/found.png
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/google/home/tabatkins/bikeshed/tests/img-sizing/file/not/found.png'
WARNING: <img> elements must have at least one of src or srcset.
FATAL ERROR: Couldn't parse 'srcset' attribute: "test.png 1x, test2.png 2x"
Bikeshed only supports a single image followed by an integer resolution. If not targeting Bikeshed specifically, HTML requires a 'src' attribute (and probably a 'width' and 'height' attribute too). This warning can also be suppressed by adding a 'no-autosize' attribute.
