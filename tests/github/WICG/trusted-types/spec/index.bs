# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is not normative.*

DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS) occurs when a web application
takes a string value from an attacker-controlled source (e.g. the
document URL parameter, or postMessage channel) and passes that value
to one of the [[#injection-sinks|injection sinks]], that eventually causes execution of the
script payload controlled by the attacker.

This vulnerability type is prevalent in the web applications for two
reasons. For one, it's easy to introduce - there are over 60 different
injection sinks (e.g. `Element.innerHTML`, or `Location.href` setters).
A lot of those sinks are widely used, and are often passed an attacker-controlled
value without the developer realizing it. Secondly, DOM XSS is
difficult to prevent. Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript it's
difficult to ascertain that this vulnerability is not present in a
given program - as such, DOM XSS is often missed during manual code
reviews, and automated code analysis. As an example,
`foo[bar] = aString` is a statement that potentially introduces DOM XSS.

This document defines [[#trusted-types|Trusted Types]] - an API that allows applications
to lock down DOM XSS injection sinks to only accept non-spoofable, typed values
in place of strings. These values can in turn only be created from
application-defined [[#policies|policies]], allowing the authors to define rules
guarding writing values to the DOM, and reducing the DOM XSS attack
surface to small, isolated parts of the web application codebase,
which are substantially easier to safeguard, monitor and review.


## Goals ## {#goals}

*   Minimize the likelihood of DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

*   Encourage a design in which XSS-related security decisions are
    encapsulated within a small part of the application.

*   Reduce DOM XSS security review surface for complex web application
    codebases.

*   Allow the detection of DOM XSS vulnerabilities similar to how regular
    programming errors are detected and surfaced to the developers, with the
    assist of dynamic and static analysis tools.

## Non-goals ## {#non-goals}

*   Prevent, or mitigate the result of injections into server-side generated
    markup, in specific reflections into the body of the scripts running in a
    document. To address server-side XSS vectors, we recommend existing
    solutions like templating systems or [[CSP3|CSP]]
    [=script-src=].
*   Address resource confinement, e.g. to prevent data exfiltration, or
    connecting to external sources via [[Fetch]].
*   Control subresource loading. Trusted Types aim to allow the authors to
    control loading resources that can script the current document, but not
    other subresources.
*   Prevent malicious authors of the web application's JavaScript code
    from being able to trigger DOM XSS; attempting to protect against  malicious
    authors would result in an overtly complex and not-practical
    design; such authors already *have* code execution capabilities, creating
    DOM XSS flaws from this starting position is not a privilege escalation.

## Use cases ## {#use-cases}

*   An author maintains a complex web application written in a framework
    that uses a secure templating system to generate the UI
    components. The application also depends on 3rd party client-side
    libraries that perform auxiliary tasks (e.g. analytics, performance
    monitoring). To ensure that none of these components introduce DOM
    XSS vulnerabilities, author defines a Trusted Type policy in the
    templating policy and enables the enforcement for the DOM sinks.

*   An existing web application interacts with the DOM mostly using XSS-safe
    patterns (i.e. withour using [=injection sinks=]). In a few places, however,
    it resorts to using risky patterns like loading additional script using
    JSONP, calling into `innerHTML` or `eval`.

    Review finds that those places do not cause XSS (e.g. because
    user-controlled data is not part of the input to those sinks), but it's
    hard to migrate the application off using these patterns.

    As such, CSP cannot be enforced on this application (without resorting to
    an unsafe version using `'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'`). Additionally,
    it's possible some codebase with DOM XSS flaws was not included in a review,
    or will be introduced in the future.

    To address this risk, the author converts the reviewed parts to using
    Trusted Types, and enables Trusted Type [=enforcement=]. Addditional places
    using the injection sinks, should they exist in the future, are correctly
    blocked and reported.

*   A security team is tasked with assuring that the client-side heavy
    application code does not contain XSS vulnerabilities. Since the server side
    code is homogeneous (it's moslty an API backend), and the application
    enforces Trusted Types, the review only focuses on the Trusted Type
    [=policies=] and their rules. Later on the reviewed policy names are
    allowed in the 'trusted-types' CSP directive, safe for the developers to
    use.

    Any additonal code, including the code of often-changing dependencies,
    can be excluded from the review, unless it creates a Trusted Type policy.
    Without it, the code cannot cause a DOM XSS.

# Framework # {#framework}

## Injection sinks ## {#injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

A DOM XSS <dfn>injection sink</dfn> is a function that evaluates an input
string value in a way that could result in XSS if that value is untrusted.

Examples of injection sinks include:

  * Functions that parse & insert HTML strings into the document like
    [[DOM-Parsing#widl-Element-innerHTML|Element.innerHTML]] setter,
  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a URL of the code to load
    like {{HTMLScriptElement/src!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.src}},
  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a code to execute like
    {{HTMLScriptElement/text!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.text}},
  * Functions that execute code directly like `eval`,
  * Functions that create a new same-origin {{Document}} with caller-controlled
    markup like {{DOMParser/parseFromString()}},
  * Navigation to 'javascript:' URLs.

An application is vulnerable to DOM XSS if it permits a flow of data from an
attacker-controlled source and permits that data to reach an injection sink
without appropriate validation, sanitization or escaping.

It's difficult to determine if DOM XSS is present by analyzing the invocations
of [=injection sinks=], as the strings do not carry the information about the
provenance of their value. To allow the authors to control values reaching
sensitive DOM and JavaScript functions, we introduce Trusted Types.

Note: The exact list of injection sinks covered by this document is defined in
[[#integrations]].

## Trusted Types ## {#trusted-types}

We introduce the following list of
<dfn>Trusted Type</dfn>s indicating that a given value is
trusted by the authors to be used with an [=injection sink=] in a certain context.

Note: **Trusted** in this context signifies the fact that the application author
is confident that a given value can be safely used with an injection sink - she
*trusts* it does not introduce a vulnerability. That does not imply that the
value is indeed *safe*.

Note: This allows the authors to specify the intention when creating a given
value, and the user agents to introduce checks based on the type of
such value to preserve the authors' intent. For example, if
authors intend a value to be used as an HTML snippet, an attempt to
load a script from that value would fail.

Note: All Trusted Types wrap over an immutable string, specified when the
objects are created. These objects are unforgable in a sense that
there is no JavaScript-exposed way to replace the inner string value
of a given object - it's stored in an internal slot with no setter
exposed.

Note: All Trusted Types stringifiers return the inner string value.
This makes it easy to incrementally migrate the application code into using
Trusted Types in place of DOM strings (it's possible to start
producing types in parts of the application, while still using and
accepting strings in other parts of the codebase). In that sense,
Trusted Types are backwards-compatible with the regular DOM APIs.

### <dfn type>TrustedHTML</dfn> ### {#trusted-html}

The TrustedHTML interface represents a string that a developer can
confidently insert into an [=injection sink=] that will render it as HTML.
These objects are immutable
wrappers around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createHTML(input)|createHTML}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface TrustedHTML {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedHTML objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
DOMString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedHTML object, return the DOMString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.

### <dfn type>TrustedScript</dfn> ### {#trusted-script}

The TrustedScript interface represents a string with an uncompiled
script body that a developer can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=]
that might lead to executing that script.
These objects are immutable wrappers
around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScript(input)|createScript}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface TrustedScript {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedScript objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
DOMString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedScript object, return the DOMString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.


### <dfn type>TrustedScriptURL</dfn> ### {#trused-script-url}

The TrustedScriptURL interface represents a string that a developer
can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=] that will parse it as a URL of
an external script resource.
These objects are immutable wrappers around a
string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScriptURL(input)|createScriptURL}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface TrustedScriptURL {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedScriptURL objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
USVString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedScriptURL object, return the USVString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.


## Policies ## {#policies}

Trusted Types can only be created via user-defined
and immutable policies that define rules for converting a string into
a given Trusted Type object. Policies allows the authors to specify custom,
programmatic rules that Trusted Types must adhere to.

<div class="example" id="sanitizing-policy">
Authors may define a
policy that will sanitize an HTML string, allowing only a subset of
tags and attributes that are known not to cause JavaScript
execution. Any {{TrustedHTML}} object created through this policy can then
be safely used in the application, and e.g. passed to `innerHTML`
setter - even if the input value was controlled by the attacker, the
policy rules neutralized it to adhere to policy-specific
contract.
<xmp highlight=js>
const sanitizingPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('sanitize-html', {
  createHTML: (input) => myTrustedSanitizer(input, { superSafe: 'ok'}),
});

myDiv.innerHTML = sanitizingPolicy.createHTML(untrustedValue);
</xmp>
</div>

Note: [=Trusted Type=] objects wrap values that are explicitly trusted by
the author. As such, creating a Trusted Type object instance becomes a de
facto DOM XSS [=injection sink=], and hence code that creates Trusted Type
instances is security-critical. To allow for strict control over Trusted Type
object creation we don't expose the constructors of those
directly, but require policy usage.

Multiple policies can be created in a given [=Realm=], allowing the
applications to define different rules for different parts of the
codebase.

<div class="example" id="policy-reference">
Library initialized with a policy allowing it to load additional scripts from
a given host.
<xmp highlight=js>

const cdnScriptsPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('cdn-scripts', {
  createScriptURL(url) {
    const parsed = new URL(url, document.baseURI);
    if (parsed.origin == 'https://mycdn.example') {
      return url;
    }
    throw new TypeError('invalid URL');
  },
});

myLibrary.init({policy: cdnScriptsPolicy});
</xmp>
</div>

Note: As Trusted Type objects can only be created via policies, if
[=enforcement=] is enabled, only the policy code can introduce a DOM
XSS, and hence call-sites of the policies' `create*` functions are the
*only* security-sensitive code in the entire program. Only this
typically small subset of the entire code base needs to be
security-reviewed for DOM XSS - there's no need to monitor or review
the [=injection sinks=] themselves, as User Agents [=enforcement|enforce=] that
those sinks will only accept Trusted Type objects, and these in turn
can only be created via policies.

The {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()|createPolicy}} function returns a policy object which `create*` functions
will create Trusted Type objects after applying the policy
rules.

Note: While it's safe to freely use a policy that sanitizes its input anywhere in the application,
there might be a need to create lax policies to be used internally, and only to be
called with author-controlled input. For example, a client-side HTML
templating library, an HTML sanitizer library, or a JS asynchronous
code plugin loading subsystem each will likely need full control over
HTML or URLs. The API design facilitates that - each policy may only
be used if the callsite can obtain a reference to the policy (a return
value from {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()}}). As such, policy
references can be treated as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a>,
access to which can be controlled using JavaScript techniques
(e.g. via closures, internal function variables, or modules).

<div class="example" id="policy-capability">
Unsafe no-op policy reachable only from within a single code block to ascertain
that it's called only with no attacker-controlled values.
<xmp highlight=js>
(function renderFootnote() {
  const unsafePolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('html', {
    createHTML: input => input,
  });
  const footnote = await fetch('/footnote.html').then(r => r.text());
  footNote.innerHTML = unsafePolicy.createHTML(footnote);
})();
</xmp>
</div>

### <dfn type>TrustedTypePolicyFactory</dfn> ### {#trusted-type-policy-factory}

TrustedTypePolicyFactory creates
{{TrustedTypePolicy|policies}} and verifies that Trusted Type object instances
were created via one of the policies.

Note: This factory object is exposed to JavaScript through `window.trustedTypes`
reference - see [[#extensions-to-the-window-interface]].

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window] interface TrustedTypePolicyFactory {
    [Unforgeable] TrustedTypePolicy createPolicy(
        DOMString policyName, optional TrustedTypePolicyOptions policyOptions);
    [Unforgeable] sequence&lt;DOMString> getPolicyNames();
    [Unforgeable] boolean isHTML(any value);
    [Unforgeable] boolean isScript(any value);
    [Unforgeable] boolean isScriptURL(any value);
    [Unforgeable] readonly attribute TrustedHTML emptyHTML;
    DOMString? getAttributeType(
        DOMString tagName,
        DOMString attribute,
        optional DOMString elementNs = "",
        optional DOMString attrNs = "");
    DOMString? getPropertyType(
        DOMString tagName,
        DOMString property,
        optional DOMString elementNs = "");
    readonly attribute TrustedTypePolicy? defaultPolicy;
};
</pre>

Internal slot `[[DefaultPolicy]]` may contain a {{TrustedTypePolicy}} object,
and is initially empty.

Internal slot `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]` is an <a>ordered set</a> of strings,
initially empty.

<div dfn-type="method" dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicyFactory">

:   <dfn>createPolicy(policyName, policyOptions)</dfn>

    The allowed policy names may be restricted by [[#content-security-policy-hdr|Content Security Policy]].
    If the policy name is not on the whitelist defined in the [=trusted-types-directive|trusted-types=] CSP directive,
    the policy creation fails with a [[WebIDL-1#idl-Error|TypeError]].
    Also, if unique policy names are enforced (i.e. `trusted-types *` is not used),
    and `createPolicy` is called more than once with any given `policyName`,
    policy creation fails with a TypeError.

    <div class="example" id="create-policy-example">
    <xmp highlight=js>

: <dfn>isHTML(value)</dfn>
:: Returns true if value is an instance of {{TrustedHTML}} and has its `[[Data]]`  internal slot set, false otherwise.

    Note: `is*` functions are used to check if a given object is truly a legitimate
    [=Trusted Type=] object (i.e. it was created via one of the configured
    policies). This is to be able to detect a forgery of the objects via
    e.g. [[ECMASCRIPT#sec-object.create|Object.create]]
    or prototype chains manipulation.

    1. If |elementNs| is an empty string, set |elementNs| to [=HTML namespace=].
    1. Let |interface| be the [=element interface=] for |localName| and |elementNs|.
    1. If |interface| has an IDL [=attribute=] member which identifier is |attribute|, and
        {{TrustedTypes}} IDL extended attribute appears on that attribute, return
        stringified {{TrustedTypes}}'s identifier and abort futher steps.

        Note: This also takes into account all members of [=interface mixins=] that

### <dfn type>TrustedTypePolicy</dfn> ### {#trusted-type-policy}

Policy objects implement a TrustedTypePolicy interface and define a
group of functions creating Trusted Type objects.
Each of the `create*` functions converts a string value to a given Trusted Type variant, or
throws a TypeError if a conversion of a given value is disallowed.

<pre class="idl">

  [Unforgeable] TrustedScript createScript(DOMString input, any... arguments);
  [Unforgeable] TrustedScriptURL createScriptURL(DOMString input, any... arguments);
};
</pre>

Each policy has a <dfn dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicy">name</dfn>.

Each TrustedTypePolicy object has an `[[options]]` internal slot, holding the {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} object describing the actual behavior of the policy.

<div dfn-type="method" dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicy">

### <dfn>Default policy</dfn> ### {#default-policy-hdr}

*This section is not normative.*

One of the policies, the policy with a [=TrustedTypePolicy/name=] `"default"`, is special;
When an [=injection sink=] is passed a string (instead of a
Trusted Type object), this policy will be implicitly called by
the user agent with the string value as the first argument, and the sink name
as a second argument.

This allows the application to define a fallback behavior to use instead of
causing a violation. The intention is to allow the applications to recover from
an unexpected data flow, and sanitize the
potentially attacker-controlled string "as a last resort", or throw if a safe value
cannot be created.

If the default policy doesn't exist, of if it throws, it will cause a CSP
violation, and a TypeError will be thrown.

Note: This optional behavior allows for introducing Trusted Type [=enforcement=]
to applications that are still using legacy code that uses injection sinks.
Needless to say, this policy should
necessarily be defined with very strict rules not to introduce a DOM
XSS vulnerability in unknown parts of the application. In an extreme
case, a lax, no-op default policy could bring the application DOM XSS
security posture back to the pre-Trusted Types level. If possible,
authors should resort to a default policy in a transitional period
only, use it to detect and rewrite their dependencies that use injection
sinks unsafely and eventually phase out the usage of the default policy entirely.

Note: See [[#get-trusted-type-compliant-string-algorithm]] for details on how
the default policy is applied.

<div class="example" id="default-policy-example">
<xmp highlight="js">
// Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types default

trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
  createScriptURL: (s, sink) => {
    console.log("Please refactor.");
    return s + "?default-policy-used&sink=" + encodeURIComponent(sink);
  }
});

aScriptElement.src = "https://cdn.example/script.js";
// Please refactor.
console.log(aScriptElement.src);
// https://cdn.example/script.js?default-policy-used&sink=script.src
</xmp>
</div>


## <dfn>Enforcement</dfn> ## {#enforcement-hdr}

Note: Enforcement is the process of checking that a value
has an appropriate type before it reaches an [=injection sink=].

The JavaScript API that allows authors to create policies and Trusted Types objects from them is always
available (via {{Window/trustedTypes}}). Since [=injection sinks=] stringify their security sensitive
arguments, and [=Trusted Type=] objects stringify to their inner string values, this allows the authors
to use Trusted Types in place of strings.

To prevent DOM XSS, on top of the JavaScript code using the Trusted Types, the user agent needs to enforce them i.e.
assert that the injection sinks are *never*  called with string values, and Trusted Type values are used instead.
This section describes how authors may control this enforcing behavior.

### Content Security Policy ### {#content-security-policy-hdr}

Applications may control Trusted Type enforcement via [[CSP#policy-delivery|configuring a Content Security Policy]]. This document defines a new [=trusted-types-directive|trusted-types=]
Content Security Policy directive that corresponds to Trusted Types rules.

Note: Using CSP mechanisms allows the authors to prepare their application for enforcing Trusted Types
via using the {{CSP#cspro-header|Content-Security-Report-Only}} HTTP Response header.

Note: Most of the enforcement rules are defined as modifications of the
algorithms in other specifiactions, see [[#integrations]].

### TrustedTypes extended attribute ### {#!trustedtypes-extended-attribute}

Note: This section describes the implementation details of the Trusted Types mechanism. IDL extended attributes are not exposed to the JavasScript code.

To annotate the [=injection sink=] functions that require Trusted Types, we introduce
<dfn data-dfn-type="extended-attribute" data-x="TrustedTypes" data-lt="TrustedTypes"><code>[TrustedTypes]</code></dfn>
IDL [=extended attributes|extended attribute=]. Its presence indicates that the relevant construct is to be supplemented with additional
Trusted Types enforcement logic.

The {{TrustedTypes}} extended attribute [=extended attribute/takes an identifier=] as an argument.
The only valid values for the identifier are {{TrustedHTML}}, {{TrustedScript}}, or {{TrustedScriptURL}}.
This extended attribute must not appear on anything other than an [=attribute=] or an [=operation=] argument.
Additionally, it must not appear on [=read only=] attributes.

When the extended attribute appears on an attribute, the setter for that attribute must run the following steps in place of the ones specified in its description:

 1. If [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=] has a [=Window/trusted type policy factory=]:

    Issue: Update when workers have TT.
    1. If the [=context object=] is an [=Element=], let |objectName| be the [=context object=]'s [=Element/local name=]; Otherwise, let |objectName| be the [=context object=]'s constructor name.
    1. Set |sink| to the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; |objectName|, [=attribute=] identifier. &raquo; with `"."` as |separator|.
        <div class="example" id="extended-attribute-attribute-example">
        For example, the following annotation and JavaScript code:
        <pre highlight=idl>
        partial interface mixin HTMLScriptElement {
          [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] attribute ScriptURLString src;
        };
        </pre>
        <pre highlight=js>
        document.createElement('script').src = foo;
        document.createElement('script').setAttribute('SrC', foo);
        </pre>
        causes the |sink| value to be `"script.src"`.
        </div>
    1. Set |value| to the result of running the [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, passing the following arguments:
        * the new value as |input|,
        * {{TrustedTypes}} extended attribute identifier as |expectedType|,
        * |sink| as |sink|,
        * [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|.
    1. If an exception was thrown, rethrow exception and abort further steps.
 1. Run the originally specified steps for this construct, using |value| as a new value to set.

Note: If the IDL attribute [=reflect/reflects=] a content attribute, identical steps should be performed when that content attribute is modified by JavaScript code e.g. via `Element.setAttribute()` function.

When the extended attribute appears on an [=operation=] argument, before its operation is invoked, run the following steps:

 1. If [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=] has a [=Window/trusted type policy factory=]:

    Issue: Update when workers have TT.
    1. If the [=context object=] is an [=Element=], let |objectName| be the [=context object=]'s [=Element/local name=]; Otherwise, let |objectName| be the [=context object=]'s constructor name.
    1. Set |sink| to the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; |objectName|, [=operation=] identifier. &raquo; with `"."` as |separator|.
        <div class="example" id="extended-attribute-operation-example">
        For example, the following annotation and JavaScript code:
        <pre highlight=idl>
        partial interface Element {
          void insertAdjacentHTML(DOMString position, [TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString text);
        };
        </pre>
        <pre highlight=js>
        document.createElement('a').insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', foo);
        </pre>
        causes the |sink| value to be `"a.insertAdjacentHTML"`.
        </div>
    1. Set the new argument value to the result of running the [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, passing the following arguments:
        * the argument value as |input|,
        * {{TrustedTypes}} extended attribute identifier as |expectedType|,
        * |sink| as |sink|,
        * [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|.
    1. If an exception was thrown, rethrow exception and abort further steps.
 1. Invoke the originally specified steps for the operation.

# Algorithms # {#algorithms}

## <dfn abstract-op>Create a Trusted Type Policy</dfn> ## {#create-trusted-type-policy-algorithm}

To create a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}, given a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} (|factory|),
a string (|policyName|), {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} dictionary (|options|), and a
[=Realm/global object=] (|global|) run these steps:

1.  Let |allowedByCSP| be the result of executing [$Should Trusted Type policy
    creation be blocked by Content Security Policy?$] algorithm with |global|,
    |policyName| and |factory|'s `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]` slot value.
1.  If |allowedByCSP| is `"Blocked"`, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort further steps.
1.  Let |policy| be a new {{TrustedTypePolicy}} object.
1.  Set |policy|'s `name` property value to |policyName|.
1.  Let |policyOptions| be a new {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} object.
1.  Set |policyOptions|
    {{TrustedTypePolicy/createHTML|createHTML}} property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createHTML|createHTML}} property value.
1.  Set |policyOptions| {{TrustedTypePolicy/createScript()|createScript}}
    property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createScript|createScript}} property value.
1.  Set |policyOptions| {{TrustedTypePolicy/createScriptURL()|createScriptURL}}
    property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createScriptURL|createScriptURL}} property value.
1.  Set |policy|'s `[[options]]` internal slot value to *policyOptions*.
1.  If the |policyName| is `default`, set the |factory|'s `[[DefaultPolicy]]` slot value to |policy|.
1.  Append |policyName| to |factory|'s `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]`.
1.  Return |policy|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Get default policy</dfn> ## {#get-default-policy-algorithm}
To get the [=default policy=] for a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} (|factory|), execute the following steps:

1.  Return the value of |factory|'s `[[DefaultPolicy]]` slot
    (null if the slot is empty).

## <dfn abstract-op>Create a Trusted Type</dfn> ## {#create-a-trusted-type-algorithm}

Given a {{TrustedTypePolicy}} |policy|, a type name |trustedTypeName|,
a string |value| and a list |arguments|, execute the following steps:

1.  Let |functionName| be a function name for the given |trustedTypeName|,
    based on the following table:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Function name</th>
        <th>Trusted Type name </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createHTML"</td>
        <td>"TrustedHTML"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createScript"</td>
        <td>"TrustedScript"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createScriptURL"</td>
        <td>"TrustedScriptURL"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  Let |options| be the value of |policy|'s `[[options]]` slot.
1.  Let |function| be the value of the property in |options| named |functionName|.
1.  If |function| is `null`, throw a {{TypeError}}.
1.  Let |policyValue| be the result of invoking |function| with
    |value| as a first argument, items of |arguments| as subsequent arguments,
    and [[ECMASCRIPT#sec-method|callback **this** value]] set to `null`.
1.  If |policyValue| is an error, return |policyValue| and abort the following steps.
1.  Let |dataString| be the result of stringifying |policyValue|.
1.  Let |trustedObject| be a new instance of an interface with a type
    name |trustedTypeName|, with its `[[Data]]` internal slot value
    set to |dataString|.
1.  Return |trustedObject|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Get Trusted Type compliant string</dfn> ## {#get-trusted-type-compliant-string-algorithm}

This algorithm will return a string that can be assigned to a DOM
[=injection sink=], optionally unwrapping it from a matching [=Trusted Type=].
It will ensure that the Trusted Type [=enforcement=] rules were respected.

Given a {{TrustedType}} type (|expectedType|), a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|),
{{TrustedType}} or a string (|input|), and a string (|sink|), run these steps:

1.  Assert: |global| is a {{Window}}.

    Issue: Synchronize when TT are added to workers (perhaps use "has a CSP list"?)
1.  Let |cspList| be the |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>.
1.  If |cspList| does not contain a [[CSP3#content-security-policy-object|policy]]
    which <a>directive set</a> containing a [[CSP3#directives|directive]] with a name `"trusted-types"`,
    return stringified |input| and abort these steps.
1.  If |input| has type |expectedType|, return stringified
    |input| and abort these steps.
1.  Otherwise, execute the following steps:
    1.  Let |defaultPolicy| be the result of executing
        [$Get default policy$] algorithm on |global|'s [=Window/trusted type policy factory=].
    1.  If |defaultPolicy| is `null`, abort these steps and resume below.
    1.  Let |convertedInput| be the result of executing [$Create a
        Trusted Type$] algorithm, with the following arguments:
        *  |defaultPolicy| as |policy|
        *  |input| as |value|
        *  |expectedType|’s type name as |trustedTypeName|
        *  &laquo; |sink| &raquo; as |arguments|
    1.  If |convertedInput| is an error, abort the following steps.
    1.  If |convertedInput| has type |expectedType|, then return
        stringified |convertedInput| and abort the following steps.
    1.  Set |input| to |convertedInput|’s value.
1.  Let |disposition| be the result of executing [$Should sink type mismatch violation be blocked by Content Security Policy?$] algorithm,
    passing |global|, |input| as |source|, and |sink|.
1.  If |disposition| is `“Allowed”`, then return stringified |input| and abort these steps.
1.  Throw a {{TypeError}}.

## Integration with HTML ## {#integration-with-html}

{{Window}} objects have a <dfn for="Window">trusted type policy factory</dfn>,
which is a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} object.

Issue: Define for workers.

### Extensions to the Window interface ### {#extensions-to-the-window-interface}

This document extends the {{Window}} interface defined by [[HTML5|HTML]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin Window {
  [Unforgeable] readonly attribute
      TrustedTypePolicyFactory trustedTypes;
};
</pre>

{{Window/trustedTypes}} returns the [[#integration-with-html|trusted
type policy factory]] of the current {{Window}}.

Note: The implementation in Chrome &lt; 78 uses `window.TrustedTypes` instead
      of `window.trustedTypes`.

Issue: Remove the note when the API in Chrome is shipped.

### Extensions to the Document interface ### {#extensions-to-the-document-interface}

This document modifies the {{Document}} interface defined by [[HTML5|HTML]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin Document {
  [CEReactions] void write([TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString... text);
  [CEReactions] void writeln([TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString... text);
};
</pre>

### Enforcement in element attributes ### {#enforcement-in-sinks}

This document modifies following IDL attributes of various DOM elements:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin HTMLScriptElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] attribute ScriptURLString src;
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScript] attribute ScriptString text;
};

partial interface mixin HTMLIFrameElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] attribute HTMLString srcdoc;
};

partial interface HTMLEmbedElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] attribute ScriptURLString src;
};

partial interface HTMLObjectElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] attribute ScriptURLString data;
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] attribute DOMString codeBase; // obsolete
};

// TODO: Add HTMLPortalElement.src from https://github.com/WICG/portals once it's specced.
</pre>

Issue: Add base.href enforcement.

### Enforcement for script text contents ### {#enforcement-in-script-text}

This document modifies how {{HTMLScriptElement}} [=child text content=] can be set to allow applications to control dynamically created scripts. It does so by
adding the {{HTMLElement/innerText}} and {{Node/textContent}} attributes directly on {{HTMLScriptElement}}. The behavior of the attributes remains the same
as in their original counterparts, apart from additional behavior triggered by the {{TrustedTypes}} extended attribute presence.

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin HTMLScriptElement : HTMLElement {
 [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScript] attribute [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] ScriptString innerText;
 [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedScript] attribute ScriptString? textContent;
};
</pre>

Additionally, this document defines [$insert text node validation steps$] for {{HTMLScriptElement}} to ascertain that text nodes inserted under {{HTMLScriptElement}} elements will satisfy Trusted Types restrictions:

1.  Let |text| be |node|'s [=child text content=].
1.  Let |convertedText| be the result of running [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$], passing |parent|'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|, {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|, |text| as |input| and `"script.text"` as |sink|.
    If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error.

    Note: If Trusted Types are not enforced, this algorithm will return early and return |input| unmodified.
1.  Set |node|'s data to |convertedText|.

Note: This prevents calling `ChildNode.after(aTrustedScript, ...)`, as the type information is lost before insert is run. To fix that, an additional metadata in Text nodes would be needed. Removed that use case for simplicity.

<div class="example" id="script-node-modification-example">
  Trusted Types prevent manipulation of text nodes under script elements.
  <pre highlight=js>
  // Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types *

  const s = document.createElement('script');
  const text = document.createTextNode('alert(1)');
  const p = document.createElement('p');

  s.appendChild(p);
  s.appendChild(text); // TypeError
  p.insertAdjacentText('beforebegin', 'alert(2)'); // TypeError
  </pre>
</div>

### Enforcement in timer functions ### {#enforcement-in-timer-functions}

This document modifies the {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope}} interface mixin:

<pre class="idl">
typedef (ScriptString or Function) TrustedTimerHandler;

partial interface mixin WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
  long setTimeout(TrustedTimerHandler handler, optional long timeout = 0, any... arguments);
  long setInterval(TrustedTimerHandler handler, optional long timeout = 0, any... arguments);
};
</pre>

To the [[HTML5#timer-initialisation-steps|timer initialization steps algorithm]],
add this step between 7.1 and 7.2:

1.  If the first operation argument is not a {{Function}}, or if the first operation argument is a {{TrustedType}}, set the first operation argument to the result of executing
    the [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with
    *   |global| set to the [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=].
    *   |input| set to the first method argument, and
    *   |expectedType| set to {{TrustedScript}}.
    *   |sink| set to `"Window.setInterval"` if <var ignore>repeat</var> is true, `"Window.setTimeout"` otherwise.

        Note: This matches the logic that the extended attribute would apply.

Note: This makes sure that a {{TrustedScript}} is passed to timer
functions in place of a string when Trusted Types are enforced, but
also unconditionally accepts any {{Function}} object.

### Enforcement in event handler content attributes ### {#enforcement-in-event-handler-content-attributes}

This document modifies the
[[HTML5#event-handler-content-attributes|attribute change steps for an event handler content attribute]].

At the beginning of step 5, insert the following steps:

1.  Let |value| be the result of executing the
    [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with the following arguments:
    *   |value| as |input|,
    *   {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|,
    *   |sink| being the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; <var ignore>element</var>'s [=Element/local name=], |localName| &raquo; with `"."` as a |separator|.

        Note: For example, `document.createElement('div').onclick = value` will result in |sink| being `'div.onclick'`.

    *   <var ignore>eventTarget</var>'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|,
1.  If the algorithm throws an error, abort these steps.

Note: This also applies to events in [[SVG2#EventAttributes]].

<div class="example" id="event-handlers-example">
  <pre highlight=js>
  // Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types *

  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.setAttribute('onerror', 'alert(1)'); // TypeError
  </pre>
</div>

## Integration with SVG ## {#integration-with-svg}

This document modifies the {{SVGScriptElement}} interface to enforce Trusted Types:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin SVGScriptElement : SVGElement {
 // overwrites the definition in SVGURIReference.
 [TrustedTypes=TrustedScriptURL] readonly attribute ScriptURLString href;
};
</pre>

Additionally, this document defines [$insert text node validation steps$] for {{SVGScriptElement}} to ascertain that text nodes inserted to {{SVGScriptElement}} elements will satisfy Trusted Types restrictions:

1.  Let |text| be |node|'s [=child text content=].
1.  Let |convertedText| be the result of running [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$], passing |parent|'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|, {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|, |text| as |input| and `"script.text"` as |sink|.
    If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error.

    Note: If Trusted Types are not enforced, this algorithm will return early and return |input| unmodified.
1.  Set |node|'s data to |convertedText|.


## Integration with DOM ## {#integration-with-dom}

### Text node validation steps ### {#dom-text-node-validation}

Add the following step at the beginning of step 7 of [[DOM#concept-node-insert|insert]] algorithm.

1. If |node| is a {{Text}} node, run [$insert text node validation steps$] for |parent|, passing |node| and |parent| as parameters.

<dfn abstract-op>insert text node validation steps</dfn> may be defined by other specifications.

## Integration with DOM Parsing ## {#integration-with-dom-parsing}

This document modifies the following interfaces defined by [[DOM-Parsing]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface Element {
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] attribute HTMLStringDefaultsEmpty outerHTML;
  [CEReactions] void insertAdjacentHTML(DOMString position, [TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString text);
};

partial interface mixin InnerHTML { // specified in a draft version at https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#the-innerhtml-mixin
  [CEReactions, TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] attribute HTMLStringDefaultsEmpty innerHTML;
};

partial interface Range {
  [CEReactions, NewObject] DocumentFragment createContextualFragment([TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString fragment);
};

[Constructor, Exposed=Window]
interface DOMParser {
  [NewObject] Document parseFromString([TrustedTypes=TrustedHTML] HTMLString str, SupportedType type);
};
</pre>

## Integration with Content Security Policy ## {#integration-with-content-security-policy}

### <dfn lt="trusted-types-directive">trusted-types</dfn> directive ### {#trusted-types-csp-directive}

This document defines *trusted-types* - a new [[CSP3#directives|Content Security Policy directive]].

{{#trusted-types-directive|trusted-types}} directive configures the Trusted
Types framework for all the [=injection sinks=] in a current [=Realm|realm=]. Specifically, it
defines which policies (identified by name) can be created, and what should
be the behavior when a string value is passed to an [=injection sink=]
(i.e. should the type-based enforcement be enabled).

The syntax for the directive's [=directive/name=] and [=directive/value=] is described by the following
ABNF:

<pre>
directive-name = "trusted-types"
directive-value = <a>serialized-tt-configuration</a>
<dfn>serialized-tt-configuration</dfn> = ( <a>tt-expression</a> *( <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#grammardef-required-ascii-whitespace">required-ascii-whitespace</a> <a>tt-expression</a> ) )
<dfn>tt-expression</dfn> = "*" / <a>tt-policy-name</a> ; In the future, add keywords
<dfn>tt-policy-name</dfn> = 1*( %x21-%x26 / %x28-%x29 / %x2B / %x2D-%x3A / %x3C-%x7E )
; Policy name can consist of any <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">VCHAR</a> character, apart from ";", ",", "*" and "'".
</pre>

<div class="example" id="whitelist-of-policy-names-in-header">
Types are enforced at sinks, and only two policies may be created: “one” and “two”.

<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types one two
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="header-that-allows-no-policy-names">
An empty [=directive=] [=directive/value=] indicates policies may not be created,
and sinks expect Trusted Type values, i.e. no [=injection sinks=] can be used
at all.

<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types
</pre>
</div>

A value `"*"` allows for creating policies with any name, including policies with a name that was already used.

<div class="example" id="wildcard-policy-name-in-header">
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types *
</pre>
</div>

If the policy named `default` is present in the list, it refers to the
[=default policy=]. All strings passed to [=injection sinks=] will be passed through it instead
of being rejected outright.

<div class="example" id="default-in-header">
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types one two default
</pre>
</div>

#### `trusted-types` Pre-Navigation check #### {#trusted-types-pre-navigation-check}

Given a [[Fetch#concept-request|request]] (|request|), a string |navigation type|, two [=browsing contexts=]
(|source| and |target|), and a [[CSP3#content-security-policy-object|policy]] (|policy|), this algorithm returns `"Blocked"`
if a navigation violates the {{#trusted-types-directive|trusted-types}} directive's constraints and `"Allowed"`
otherwise. This constitutes the {{#trusted-types-directive|trusted-types}} directive's [=pre-navigation check=]:

Note: This algorithm assures that the code to be executed by a navigation to a `javascript:` URL will have to pass through a
<a>default policy</a>'s `createScript` function, in addition to all other restrictions imposed by other CSP directives.

1. If |request|'s [=request/url=]'s [=url/scheme=] is not `"javascript"`, return `"Allowed"` and abort further steps.
1. Let |urlString| be the result of running the [=URL serializer=] on |request|'s [=request/url=].
1. Let |encodedScriptSource| be the result of removing the leading `"javascript:"` from |urlString|.
1. Let |defaultPolicy| be the result of executing [$Get default policy$] algorithm on |source|'s {{WindowProxy}}'s [=trusted type policy factory=].
1. If |defaultPolicy| is `null`, return `"Blocked"` and abort further steps.
1. Let |convertedScriptSource| be the result of executing [$Create a Trusted Type$] algorithm, with the following arguments:

    * |defaultPolicy| as |policy|
    * |encodedScriptSource| as |value|
    * `"TrustedScript` as |trustedTypeName|
    * &laquo; `"Location.href"` &raquo; as |arguments|
1. If |convertedScriptSource| is not a {{TrustedScript}} object, return `"Blocked"` and abort further steps.
1. Set |urlString| to be the result of prepending `"javascript:"` to stringified |convertedScriptSource|.
1. Let |newURL| be the result of running the [=URL parser=] on |urlString|. If the parser returns a failure, return `"Blocked"` and abort further steps.
1. Set |request|'s [=request/url=] to |newURL|.

     Note: No other CSP directives operate on `javascript:` URLs in a pre-navigation check. Other directives that check javascript: URLs
           will operate on the modified URL later, in the [=inline check=].
1. Return `"Allowed"`.

Given a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|sink|) and a string (|source|) this algorithm
returns `"Blocked"` if the [=injection sink=] requires a [=Trusted Type=], and
`"Allowed"` otherwise.

1.  Let |result| be `"Allowed"`.
1.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>:
    1.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> does not contain a <a>directive</a>
        which [=directive/name=] is `"trusted-types"`, skip to the next |policy|.
    1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing

[=Trusted Type Policy=] should not be created, and `"Allowed"` otherwise.

1.  Let |result| be `"Allowed"`.
1.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>:

### Violation object changes ### {#csp-violation-object-hdr}

[=violation|Violation=] object [=violation/resource=] also allows `"trusted-types-policy"`

### 'trusted-script' keyword ### {#trusted-script-csp-keyword}

Note: See <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/938">TC39/ecma262 issue #938</a>
(adding the value to be compiled to algorithm parameters).

<div class="note">Note: EcmaScript code may call `Function()` and `eval` cross realm.
<pre highlight="js">
  let f = new self.top.Function(source);
</pre>
In this case, the |callerRealm|'s Window is `self` and the |calleeRealm|'s Window is `self.top`.
The Trusted Types portion of this algorithm uses |calleeRealm| for consistency with other sinks.
<pre highlight="js">
  // Assigning a string to another Realm's DOM sink uses that Realm's default policy.
  self.top.body.innerHTML = 'Hello, World!';
  // Using another Realm's builtin Function constructor should analogously use that
  // Realm's default policy.
  new self.top.Function('alert(1)')()
</pre>
This is subtly different from the CSP directive enforcement portion which rejects if either
the |calleeRealm| or |callerRealm|'s Content-Security-Policy rejects string compilation.

#### 'trusted-script' support for eval #### {#csp-trusted-script-eval}

This document modifies the [[CSP3#can-compile-strings|EnsureCSPDoesNotBlockStringCompilation]]
which is reproduced in its entirety below with additions and deletions.

Given two [[ECMASCRIPT#realm|realms]] (|callerRealm| and
|calleeRealm|), and a <del>string</del> <ins>value</ins>
(|source|), this algorithm returns <del>normally</del>
<ins>the source string to compile</ins> if compilation is allowed, and
throws an "`EvalError`" if not:

1.  <ins>Let |sourceString| be the result of executing the
    [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with:
    *   |calleeRealm| as |global|,
    *   |source| as |input|,
    *   `"eval"` as |sink|,
    *   {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|.</ins>

2.  <ins>If the algorithm throws an error, throw an {{EvalError}}.</ins>

3.  <ins>Let |isExempt| be the result of executing the [$IsSourceExempt$] algorithm with:
    *   |calleeRealm|’s {{CSP list}} as |cspList|.</ins>

4.  Let |globals| be a list containing |calleeRealm|'s [=Realm/global object=] and |calleeRealm|'s
    [=Realm/global object=].

5.  For each |global| in |globals|:

    1.  Let |result| be "`Allowed`".

    2.  For each |policy| in |global|'s [[CSP#global-object-csp-list|CSP list]]:

        1.  Let |source-list| be `null`.

        2.  If |policy| contains a [=directive=] whose [=directive/name=] is "`script-src`", then
            set |source-list| to that [=directive=]'s [=directive/value=].

            Otherwise if |policy| contains a [=directive=] whose [=directive/name=] is
            "`default-src`", then set |source-list| to that directive's [=directive/value=].

        3.  If |source-list| is not `null`, and does not contain a [=source expression=] which is
            an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string "<a grammar>`'unsafe-eval'`</a>", <ins>and
            it is the case that (|isExempt| is not true or |source-list| does not contain a
            [=source expression=] which is an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the
            string "<a grammar>`'trusted-script'`</a>")</ins> then:

            1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing [[CSP3#create-violation-for-global]] on
                |global|, |policy|, and "`script-src`".

            2.  Set |violation|'s [=violation/resource=] to "`inline`".

            3.  If |source-list| [=list/contains=] the expression
                "<a grammar>`'report-sample'`</a>", then set |violation|'s [=violation/sample=] to
                the substring of <del>|source|</del> <ins>|sourceString|</ins> containing its first
                40 characters.

            4.  Execute [[CSP3#report-violation]] on |violation|.

            5.  If |policy|'s [=policy/disposition=] is "`enforce`", then set |result| to
                "`Blocked`".

    3.  If |result| is "`Blocked`", throw an `EvalError` exception.

6. <ins>Return |sourceString|.</ins>

Note: returning |sourceString| means that the string that gets
compiled is that returned by any [=default policy=] in the course of
executing [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$].

Issue: This depends on a solution to
<a href="https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/issues/144">issue #144</a> like <a
href="https://github.com/tc39-transfer/dynamic-code-brand-checks#problem-host-callout-does-not-receive-type-information">TC39 HostBeforeCompile</a>

Issue: In some cases, the violation "`'report-sample'`" contain the result of
applying the default policy to a string argument which differs.
Specifically when, there is a [=default policy=], |isExempt| is false,
and |source| there is a CSP policy for either the |callerRealm|
or |callerRealm| that disallows "`'unsafe-eval'"`.
Is this a feature or a bug?

Note: The previous algorithm reports violations via both report-uris where
callerRealm != calleeRealm.  If [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] reports an
error, it only reports it via its |calleeRealm|'s report-uri.

#### 'trusted-script' support for javascript: URLs #### {#csp-trusted-script-javascript-url}

This document modifies the [[CSP3#match-element-to-source-list|Does element match source list for type and source?]]
algorithm, for it to recognize the 'trusted-script' keyword for `javascript:` navigations.

Add the following step after step 1:

2.  If |type| is `"navigation"`, |list| [=list/contains=] an [=ASCII case-insensitive=]
    match for the string "<a grammar>`'trusted-script'`</a>" and [$IsSourceExempt$] algorithm executed on [=active document=]'s <a>CSP list</a> returns true,
    return `"Matches"`.


### <dfn abstract-op>IsSourceExempt</dfn> Algorithm ### {#is-source-exempt-algorithm}

The IsSourceExempt algorithm takes a <a>CSP List</a> (|cspList|) and executes
the following steps:

1.  If |cspList| contains a [[CSP3#content-security-policy-object|policy]] whose
    <a>directive set</a> contains a [[CSP3#directives|directive]] with a name
    `"trusted-types"`, return true.
1.  Return false.

Note: This checks whether Trusted Types enforcement would have rejected the
input, were it problematic in the callout to [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$].


# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

Trusted Types are not intended to defend against XSS in an actively malicious
execution environment. It's assumed that the application is written by
non-malicious authors; the intent is to prevent developer mistakes that could
result in security bugs, and not to defend against first-party malicious code
actively trying to bypass policy restrictions. Below we enumerate already
identified vectors that remain risky even in environments with enforced
Trusted Types.

## Cross-document vectors ## {#cross-document-vectors}

While the code running in a window in which Trusted Types are enforced cannot
dynamically create nodes that would bypass the policy restrictions, it is
possible that such nodes can be imported or adopted from documents in other
windows, that don't have the same set of restrictions. In essence - it is
possible to bypass Trusted Types if a malicious author creates a setup in which
a restricted document colludes with an unrestricted one.

CSP propagation rules (see [[CSP3#initialize-document-csp]] partially address this
issue, as new [=local scheme=] documents will inherit the same set of restrictions.
To address this issue comprehensively, other mechanisms like
<a href="https://wicg.github.io/origin-policy/">Origin Policy</a>
should be used to ensure that baseline security rules are applied for the whole
origin.

## Deprecated features ## {#deprecated-features}

Some long-deprecated and rarely used plaform features are not subject to Trusted
Types, and could potentially be used by malicious authors to overcome the
restrictions:

* <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/">HTML imports</a>

## Bypass vectors ## {#bypass-vectors}

Issue(WICG/trusted-types#64): Mention anchor element properties bypass.

Issue(WICG/trusted-types#47): Mention text/attribute node copy bypass vectors.


## Best practices for policy design ## {#best-practices-for-policy-design}

Trusted Types limit the scope of the code that can introduce DOM XSS
vulnerabilities to the implementation of [[#policies|policies]]. In this design,
insecure policies can still enable XSS. Special emphasis needs to be taken by
use policies that are either secure for all possible inputs, or limit the access
to insecure policies, such that they are only called with non-attacker
controlled inputs.

As policies are custom JavaScript code, they may be written in a way that heavily
depends on a global state. We advise against this. The policies should
be self-contained as much as possible. All objects that may alter security decisions
a policy makes effectively *become* the policy, and should be guarded & reviewed
together.

Issue: Refer to the external document on secure policy design.

# Implementation Considerations # {#implementation-considerations}

## Vendor-specific Extensions and Addons ## {#vendor-specific-extensions-and-addons}

Restriction imposed by Trusted Types SHOULD
NOT interfere with the operation of user-agent features like addons,
extensions, or bookmarklets. These kinds of features generally advance
the user’s priority over page authors, as espoused in
[[html-design-principles]]. Specifically, extensions SHOULD be able to pass strings
to the DOM XSS [=injection sinks=] without triggering [=default policy=]
execution, violation generation, or the rejection of the value.
