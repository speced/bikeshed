# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

Using existing capabilities a page is able to determine when it is currently
visible to the user (using the {{Document/hidden}} property and
{{Document/onvisibilitychange}} event). It is also possible to know when the
user has recently interacted with the page by observing
{{GlobalEventHandlers/onmousemove}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/onkeypress}}, and
other events triggered by user input. While sufficiently reflecting user
engagement with a particular page these events give an incomplete picture of
whether the user is still present at their device. For example, if
{{Document/hidden}} is `true`, then the device screensaver may have activated,
or the user could have switched to a different application. If it is `false` but
there have been no recent input events, then the user could have left their
computer to grab a cup of coffee, or they could be editing a document in another
window side-by-side with the page.

Making these distinctions is important for applications which have the option of
delivering notifications across multiple devices, such as a desktop and
smartphone. Users may find it frustrating when notifications are delivered to
the wrong device or are disruptive. For example, if they switch from a tab
containing a messaging application to one for a document they are editing, the
messaging application, not being able to observe that the user is still
interacting with their device, may assume that they have left to grab a coffee
and start delivering notifications to their phone, causing it to buzz
distractingly, instead of displaying notifications on their desktop or
incrementing a badge count.

## Alternatives Considered ## {#alternatives-considered}

An alternative design would protect this information by allowing a notification
to be marked as "hide on active" or "hide on idle" and not allowing the page to
observe whether or not the notification was actually shown. The problem with
this approach is that the intelligent notification routing described previously
requires observing these signals of user presence and making centralized
decisions based on the state of all of the user's devices.

For example, to route notifications to a user's mobile device when they get up
to grab a coffee the messaging application could detect that it is no longer
visible and start sending push messages to the mobile device while marking the
desktop notifications as "hide on active". If the user were still at their desk
but using a different application then they would start getting the distracting
notifications from their mobile device this proposal is attempting to avoid
whether or not the desktop is able to successfully suppress them. Successful
suppression of duplicate and disruptive notification requires multi-device
coordination.

Allowing notifications to be hidden also breaks implementor mitigations for the
[[PUSH-API]] being used to run silent background tasks.

# Observing User Presence # {#api}

## Model ## {#api-model}

This specification defines a model for user presence on two dimensions: idle
state and screen lock.

### The {{UserIdleState}} enum ### {#api-useridlestate}

<xmp class="idl">
enum UserIdleState {
    "active",
    "idle"
};
</xmp>

: {{"active"}}

::  Indicates that the user has interacted with the device in the last
    {{IdleOptions/threshold}} milliseconds.

: {{"idle"}}

::  Indicates that the user has not interacted with the device in at least
    {{IdleOptions/threshold}} milliseconds.

### The {{ScreenIdleState}} enum ### {#api-screenidlestate}

<xmp class="idl">
enum ScreenIdleState {
    "locked",
    "unlocked"
};
</xmp>

: {{"locked"}}

::  Indicates that the device has engaged a screensaver or lock screen which
    prevents content from being seen or interacted with.

: {{"unlocked"}}

::  Indicates that the device is able to display content and be interacted with.

## Permissions ## {#api-permissions}

The <dfn permission export>"idle-detection"</dfn> permission is a [=default powerful feature=].

## Permissions policy ## {#api-permissions-policy}

This specification defines a [=policy-controlled feature=] identified by the
string `"idle-detection"`. Its [=default allowlist=] is `'self'`.

<div class="note">
The [=default allowlist=] of `'self'` allows usage of this feature on
same-origin nested frames by default but prevents access by third-party content.

Third-party usage can be selectively enabled by adding the
`allow="idle-detection"` attribute to an {{iframe}} element:

<div class="example">
```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" allow="idle-detection"></iframe>
```
</div>

Alternatively, this feature can be disabled completely in first-party contexts
by specifying the permissions policy in an HTTP response header:

<div class="example">
```http
Permissions-Policy: idle-detection 'none'
```
</div>

See [[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]] for more details.
</div>

## The {{IdleDetector}} interface ## {#api-idledetector}

<xmp class="idl">
dictionary IdleOptions {
  [EnforceRange] unsigned long long threshold;
  AbortSignal signal;
};

[
  SecureContext,
  Exposed=(Window,DedicatedWorker)
] interface IdleDetector : EventTarget {
  constructor();
  readonly attribute UserIdleState? userState;
  readonly attribute ScreenIdleState? screenState;
  attribute EventHandler onchange;
  [Exposed=Window] static Promise<PermissionState> requestPermission();
  Promise<undefined> start(optional IdleOptions options = {});
};
</xmp>

Instances of {{IdleDetector}} are created with the [=internal slots=] described
in the following table:

<table dfn-for=IdleDetector dfn-type=attribute>
  <tr>
    <th>[=Internal slot=]</th>
    <th>Initial value</th>
    <th>Description (non-normative)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><dfn>\[[state]]</dfn></th>
    <td>`"stopped"`</td>
    <td>Tracks the active state of the {{IdleDetector}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><dfn>\[[threshold]]</dfn></th>
    <td>`undefined`</td>
    <td>The configured idle detection threshold</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><dfn>\[[userState]]</dfn></td>
    <td>`null`</td>
    <td>The last known user idle state</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><dfn>\[[screenState]]</dfn></td>
    <td>`null`</td>
    <td>The last known screen idle state</td>
  </tr>
</table>

        1.  Set |this|.{{IdleDetector/[[threshold]]}} to |options|["{{threshold}}"].
        1.  [=Resolve=] |result|.
1.  Return |result|.

</div>

<div class="example">

The availability of this API can be detected by looking for the {{IdleDetector}}
constructor in the {{Window}} object.

```js
if (!('IdleDetector' in window)) {
  console.log('Idle detection is not available.');
  return;
}
```

Calling {{start()}} will fail if the <a permission>"idle-detection"</a> permission
has not been [=permission/granted=].

```js
if ((await IdleDetector.requestPermission()) !== 'granted') {
  console.log('Idle detection permission not granted.');
  return;
}
```

A set of options can be configured to control the threshold the [=user agent=]
uses to decide when the user has become idle.

```js
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

const options = {
  threshold: 60_000,
  signal,
};
```

The {{IdleDetector}} can now be created and started. An listener for the
{{"change"}} event is added and will be fired if the {{userState}} or
{{screenState}} attributes change.

```js
try {
  const idleDetector = new IdleDetector();
  idleDetector.addEventListener('change', () => {
    console.log(\`Idle change: ${idleDetector.userState}, ${idleDetector.screenState}.\`);
  });
  await idleDetector.start(options);
  console.log('IdleDetector is active.');
} catch (err) {
  // Deal with initialization errors like permission denied,
  // running outside of top-level frame, etc.
  console.error(err.name, err.message);
}
```

At a later time the page can cancel its interest in state change events by
removing its event listeners or using the {{AbortSignal}} that was passed to
{{start()}}.

```js
controller.abort();
console.log('IdleDetector is stopped.');
```
</div>

### Reacting to state changes ### {#state-changes}

<div algorithm="state changes">

For each {{IdleDetector}} instance |detector| where |detector|.{{[[state]]}} is
`"started"` the [=user agent=] MUST continuously monitor the following
conditions:

*   If |detector|.{{[[userState]]}} is {{"active"}} and the user has not
    interacted with the device within the last |detector|.{{[[threshold]]}}
    milliseconds, it MUST [=queue a global task=] on the [=relevant global
    object=] of |detector| using the [=idle detection task source=] to run the
    following steps:

    1.  Set |detector|.{{[[userState]]}} to {{"idle"}}.
    1.  [=Fire an event=] named {{"change"}} at |detector|.


*   If |detector|.{{[[userState]]}} is {{"idle"}} and the user interacts with
    the device, it MUST [=queue a global task=] on the [=relevant global
    object=] of |detector| using the [=idle detection task source=] to run the
    following steps:

    1.  Set |detector|.{{[[userState]]}} to {{"active"}}.
    1.  [=Fire an event=] named {{"change"}} at |detector|.

*   If |detector|.{{[[screenState]]}} is {{"unlocked"}} and the screen is
    locked, it MUST [=queue a global task=] on the [=relevant global object=] of
    |detector| using the [=idle detection task source=] to run the following
    steps:

    1.  Set |detector|.{{[[screenState]]}} to {{"locked"}}.
    1.  [=Fire an event=] named {{"change"}} at |detector|.

*   If |detector|.{{[[screenState]]}} is {{"locked"}} and the screen is
    unlocked, it MUST [=queue a global task=] on the [=relevant global object=]
    of |detector| using the [=idle detection task source=] to run the following
    steps:

    1.  Set |detector|.{{[[screenState]]}} to {{"unlocked"}}.
    1.  [=Fire an event=] named {{"change"}} at |detector|.

# Security and privacy considerations # {#security-and-privacy}

*This section is non-normative.*

## Cross-origin information leakage ## {#privacy-cross-origin-leakage}

This interface exposes the state of global system properties and so care must be
taken to prevent them from being used as cross-origin communication or
identification channels. Similar concerns are present in specifications such as
[[DEVICE-ORIENTATION]] and [[GEOLOCATION-API]], which mitigate them by requiring
a visible or focused context. This prevents multiple origins from observing the
global state at the same time. These mitigations are unfortunately inappropriate
here because the intent of this specification is precisely to allow a limited
form of tracking in blurred and hidden contexts. A malicious page could notify a
tracking server whenever the user is detected as idle or active. If multiple
pages the user was visiting notified the same server it could use the timing of
the events to guess which sessions corresponded to a single user as they would
arrive roughly simultaneously.

To reduce the number of independent contexts with access to this interface this
specification restricts it to top-level and same-origin contexts. Access can be
delegated to a cross-origin context through [[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]].

To further reduce the number of contexts this specification requires
a page to obtain the <a permission>"idle-detection"</a> permission. User agents should inform
the user of the capability that this permission grants and encourage them to
only [=permission/grant=] it to trusted sites which have a legitimate purpose for this data.

Implementations that provide a "private browsing" mode should not allow this
capability in contexts where this mode is enabled. Implementations should be
careful however to avoid the lack of this capability from being used as a signal
that this mode is enabled. This can be accomplished by refusing to allow the
<a permission>"idle-detection"</a> permission to be [=permission/granted=] but delaying the automatic
dismissal of the permission request by a random interval so that it appears to
have been a user action.

## Behavior tracking ## {#privacy-behavior-tracking}

While this interface does not provide details of the user interaction which
triggered an {{"idle"}} to {{"active"}} transition, with a sufficiently short
threshold these events could be used to detect behavior such as typing. This
specification therefore restricts the requested threshold to a minimum of at
least 60 seconds.

The permission requirement described previously also helps to mitigate the
general concern that this interface can be used to build a profile of when and
for how long the user typically interacts with their device.

## User coercion ## {#privacy-user-coercion}

Sites may require the user to [=permission/grant=] them the <a permission>"idle-detection"</a> [=permission=]
before unlocking some functionality. For example, a testing site could require
this permission as part of an anti-cheating mechanism to detect the user
consulting forbidden reference materials in another window. This type of
"Contract of Adhesion" has been observed with other permissions such as
notifications, FIDO attestation and DRM identifiers.

A potential mitigation for this concern is to design that interface so that it
is not possible for a site to determine whether the user has
[=permission/granted=] or [=permission/denied=] the permission.
An implementation could refuse to acknowledge that the user is
idle, reducing a site to only the signals currently available. This mitigation
could be detectable as it is unlikely that a user who has not interacted with a
page for hours has nevertheless still been continuously interacting with
something else. Implementations could instead insert fake idle transition events
which correspond to plausible behavior given the other signals available to the
page.

This specification does not mandate this type of mitigation as it could create a
poor user experience when sites take action based on this false data. For
example, the message application mentioned previously would not deliver
notifications to the user's mobile device because it believes the signals it has
been given indicate that they are still at their desktop. As the site cannot
detect that it is in this state it cannot directly recommend an action for the
user to take to get themselves out of it.

The harm done by such a site is limited as tracking is only possible while the
user is visiting that page. Tracking across multiple origins requires permission
to be requested on each participating site.

# Accessibility considerations # {#accessibility}

*This section is non-normative.*

Users with physical or cognitive impairments may require more time to interact
with user agents and content. Implementations should not allow distinguishing
such users, or limiting their ability to interact with content any more than
existing observation of UI events. For example, implementation should ensure
that interactions from assistive technologies count towards considering the user
active.

The use of a permission also requires that user agents provide a user interface
element to support requesting and managing that permission. Any such user
interface elements must be designed with accessibility tools in mind. For
example, a user interface describing the capability being requested should
provide the same description to tools such as screen readers.

# Internationalization considerations # {#internationalization}

*This section is non-normative.*

The interface described by this specification has limited internationalization
considerations, however the use of a permission does require that user agents
provide a user interface element to support requesting and managing that
permission. Any content displayed by the user agent in this context should be
translated into the user's native language.
