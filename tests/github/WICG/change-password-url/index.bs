Abstract: This specification defines a well-known URL that sites can use
 to make their change password forms discoverable by tools. This simple
 affordance provides a way for software to help the user find the way to
 change their password.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Client-side password management software helps improve both the security and usability of websites which require authentication. It improves security by reducing cross-site password reuse, and enhances usability by providing autofill functionality.

Sites currently lack a way to programmatically advertise where a user <span class="allow-2119">can</span> change their password. By proposing a well-known URL for changing passwords, this specification enables password managers to help users change their passwords on sites which support it.

</div>

<h2 id="infra">Infrastructure</h2>

This specification depends on the Infra Standard. [[!INFRA]]

This specification uses terminology from the
Fetch,
HTML,
HTTP, and
URL standards. [[!FETCH]] [[!HTML]] [[!HTTP-SEMANTICS]] [[!URL]]

<h2 id="semantics">Change Password URLs</h2>

A <dfn export>change password url</dfn> of an [=origin=] is a URL that points to a resource that clients can use to discover where a user should go to update their password on [=origin=].

Given an |origin|, clients <dfn export>generate a change password url</dfn> by running these steps:

1.  If |origin| is not a [=potentially trustworthy origin=], return failure.

2.  Assert: |origin| is a [=tuple origin=].

3.  Let |url| be a new {{URL}} with values set as follows:

    :   [=url/scheme=]
    ::  |origin|'s [=origin/scheme=]
    :   [=url/host=]
    ::  |origin|'s [=origin/host=]
    :   [=url/port=]
    ::  |origin|'s [=origin/port=]
    :   [=url/path=]
    ::  « ".well-known", "change-password" ».

4.  Return |url|.

<p class=example>The change password url for origin <code>"https://example.com/"</code> is <code>"https://example.com/.well-known/change-password"</code>.

Servers should redirect HTTP [=requests=] for an [=origin's=] [=change password url=] to the actual page on which users may change their password by returning a [=response=] with a [=redirect status=] and [=Location=] header. [[!FETCH]] [[!HTTP-SEMANTICS]]
Clients must handle such redirects when requesting a [=change password url=].

If necessary, servers may respond with an HTML document containing an <{meta/http-equiv}> pragma directive in the [=refresh state=]. [[!HTML]] Clients should handle such redirects when requesting a [=change password url=].

Servers must not locate the actual change password page at the [=change password url=], per [[WELL-KNOWN#section-1.1|RFC5785 §1.1 Appropriate Use of Well-Known URIs]]. Clients must handle [=ok status=] responses when requesting a [=change password url=].

<h2 id="iana">IANA considerations</h2>

<h3 id="the-change-password-well-known-uri">The <code>change-password</code> well-known URI</h3>

This document defines the “<code>.well-known</code>” URI <code>change-password</code>.
This registration will be submitted to the IESG for review, approval, and registration with IANA using the template defined in [[!WELL-KNOWN]] as follows:

: URI suffix
:: change-password

: Change controller
:: W3C

: Specification document(s)
:: This document is the relevant specification. (See [[#semantics]])
