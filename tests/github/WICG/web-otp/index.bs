# Introduction # {#intro}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

*This section is non-normative.*

Many web sites need to verify credentials (e.g. phone numbers and
email addresses) as part of their authentication flows. They currently
rely on sending one-time-passwords (OTP) to these communication channels to
be used as proof of ownership. The one-time-password is manually
handed back by the user (typically by copying/pasting) to the web app
which is onerous and erroneous.

This a proposal for a client side javascript API that enables web
sites to request OTPs and a set of transport-specific conventions (we
start with SMS while leaving the door open to others) that can be used
in coordination with browsers.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## The client side API ## {#intro-client}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

In this proposal, websites have the ability to call a browser API to
request OTPs coming from specific transports (e.g. via SMS).

The browser intermediates the receipt of the SMS and the handing off
to the calling website (typically asking for the user's consent), so
the API returns a promise asynchronously.

<div class=example>
```js
let {code, type} = await navigator.credentials.get({
  otp: {
    transport: ["sms"]
  }
});
```
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## The server side API ## {#intro-server}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Once the client side API is called, the website's server can send
OTPs to the client via the requested transport mechanisms. For each
of these transport mechanism, a server side convention is set in
place to guarantee that the OTP is delivered safely and
programatically.

For SMS, for example, servers should send [=origin-bound one-time code messages=] to clients. [[sms-one-time-codes]]

<div class="example">

In the following [=origin-bound one-time code message=], the host is `"example.com"`, the code is `"123456"`, and the explanatory text is `"Your authentication code is 123456.\n"`.

```
"Your authentication code is 123456.

@example.com #123456"
```

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Feature Detection ## {#intro-feature-detection}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Not all user agents necessarily need to implement the WebOTP API at
the exact same moment in time, so websites need a mechanism to detect
if the API is available.

Websites can check for the presence of the OTPCredential global
interface:

<div class=example>
```js
if (!window.OTPCredential) {
  // feature not available
  return;
}
```
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Web Components ## {#intro-wc}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

For the most part, OTP verification largely relies on:

- input, forms and copy/paste, on the client side and
- third party frameworks to send SMS, on the server side.

We expect some of these frameworks to develop declarative versions of
this API to facilitate the deployment of their customer's existing
code.

<div class=example>
Web Component Polyfills

```html
<script src="sms-sdk.js"></script>

<form>
  <input is="one-time-code" required />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```
</div>

And here is an example of how a framework could implement it
using web components:

<div class=example>
Web Component Polyfills

```js
customElements.define("one-time-code",
  class extends HTMLInputElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      this.receive();
    }
    async receive() {
      let {code, type} = await navigator.credentials.get({
        otp: {
         transport: ["sms"]
        }
      });
      this.value = otp;
      this.form.submit();
    }
  }, {
    extends: "input"
});
```
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Abort API ## {#intro-abort}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Many modern websites handle navigations on the client side. So, if a
user navigates away from an OTP flow to another flow, the request
needs to be cancelled so that the user isn't bothered with a
permission prompt that isn't relevant anymore.

To facilitate that, an abort controller can be passed to abort the
request:

<div class=example>
```js
const abort = new AbortController();

setTimeout(() => {
  // abort after two minutes
  abort.abort();
}, 2 * 60 * 1000);
  
let {code, type} = await navigator.credentials.get({
  signal: abort.signal,
  otp: {
    transport: ["sms"]
  }
});
```
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Client Side API # {#API}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Websites call <code><a idl for="CredentialsContainer" lt="get()">navigator.credentials.get({otp:..., ...})</a></code> to retrieve an OTP.

The algorithm of {{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}} looks through all of the interfaces that inherit from {{Credential}} in the <a abstract-op>Request a `Credential`</a> abstract operation.

In that operation, it finds {{OTPCredential}} which inherits from {{Credential}}. It calls
<code>OTPCredential.{{OTPCredential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]]()}}</code> to collect any [=credentials=] that
should be available without [=user mediation=], and if it does not find
exactly one of those, it then calls <code>OTPCredential.{{OTPCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]]()}}</code> to have
the user select a credential source and fulfill the request.

Since this specification requires an [=authorization gesture=] to create OTP [=credentials=], the <code>OTPCredential.{{OTPCredential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]]()}}</code> [=internal method=] inherits the default behavior of
{{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]]()|Credential.[[CollectFromCredentialStore]]()}}, of returning an empty set.

It is then the responsibility of <code>OTPCredential.{{OTPCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]]()}}</code> to provide an OTP.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## The OTPCredential Interface ## {#OTPCredential}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{OTPCredential}} interface extends {{Credential}} and contains
the attributes that are returned to the caller when a new one time
password is retrieved.

{{OTPCredential}}'s [=interface object=] inherits {{Credential}}'s implementation of
{{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}, and defines its own
implementation of {{OTPCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}.

<xmp class=idl>
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
interface OTPCredential : Credential {
    readonly attribute DOMString code;
};
</xmp>

<dl dfn-type="attribute" dfn-for="OTPCredential">
    :   {{Credential/id}}
    ::  This attribute is inherited from {{Credential}}

    :   <dfn>\[[type]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{OTPCredential}} [=interface object=]'s {{Credential/[[type]]}} [=internal slot=]'s value is the string
        "`otp`".

    :   <dfn>{{OTPCredential/code}}</dfn>
    ::  The retrieved one time password. 

</dl>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
### The <code><dfn for="OTPCredential" method>\[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)</dfn></code> Method ### {#sctn-discover-from-external-source}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This method is called every time <code><a idl for="CredentialsContainer" lt="get()">navigator.credentials.get({otp:..., ...})</a></code> and is responsible for returning an OTP when one is requested (i.e. when <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/otp}}</code> is passed).

This [=internal method=] accepts three arguments:

<dl dfn-type="argument" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)">

    :   <dfn>origin</dfn>
    ::  This argument is the [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=], as determined by the
        calling {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} implementation, i.e., {{CredentialsContainer}}'s <a abstract-op>Request a `Credential`</a> abstract operation.

    :   <dfn>options</dfn>
    ::  This argument is a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object whose
        <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/otp}}</code> member contains a {{OTPCredentialRequestOptions}}
        object specifying the desired attributes of the OTP to retrieve.

    :   <dfn>sameOriginWithAncestors</dfn>
    ::  This argument is a Boolean value which is [TRUE] if and only if the caller's [=environment settings object=] is
        [=same-origin with its ancestors=]. It is [FALSE] if caller is cross-origin.

        Note: Invocation of this [=internal method=] indicates that it was allowed by
        [=permissions policy=], which is evaluated at the [[!CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]] level.
        See [[#sctn-permissions-policy]].
</dl>

Note: <strong>This algorithm is synchronous:</strong> the {{Promise}} resolution/rejection is handled by
{{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}}.

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:

1. Assert: <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/otp}}</code> is [=present=].
1. Let |options| be the value of <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/otp}}</code>.
1. Let |callerOrigin| be {{OTPCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)/origin}}.
    If |callerOrigin| is an [=opaque origin=], throw a {{DOMException}} whose name is "{{NotAllowedError}}", and terminate this algorithm.
1. Let |effectiveDomain| be the |callerOrigin|'s [=effective domain=].
    If [=effective domain=] is not a [=valid domain=], then throw a
    {{DOMException}} whose name is "{{SecurityError}}" and terminate this algorithm.

        Note: An [=effective domain=] may resolve to a [=host=], which can be represented in various manners,
        such as [=domain=], [=ipv4 address=], [=ipv6 address=], [=opaque host=], or [=empty host=].
        Only the [=domain=] format of [=host=] is allowed here. This is for simplification and also is
        in recognition of various issues with using direct IP address identification in concert with
        PKI-based security.
1. If the <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/signal}}</code> is [=present=] and
    [=AbortSignal/aborted=], throw the <code>|options|.{{CredentialRequestOptions/signal}}</code>'s
    [=AbortSignal/abort reason=] and terminate this algorithm.
1. TODO(goto): figure out how to connect the dots here with the transport algorithms.

During the above process, the user agent SHOULD show some UI to the user to guide them in the process of sharing the OTP with the origin.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## `CredentialRequestOptions` ## {#CredentialRequestOptions}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

To support obtaining OTPs via {{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}},
this document extends the {{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary as follows:

<xmp class="idl">
    partial dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
        OTPCredentialRequestOptions otp;
    };
</xmp>

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="CredentialRequestOptions">
    :   <dfn>otp</dfn>
    ::  This OPTIONAL member is used to make WebOTP requests.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## `OTPCredentialRequestOptions` ## {#OTPCredentialRequestOptions}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{OTPCredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary supplies
{{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}} with the data it needs to retrieve an
OTP.

<xmp class="idl">
    dictionary OTPCredentialRequestOptions {
      sequence<OTPCredentialTransportType> transport = [];
    };
</xmp>

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="OTPCredentialRequestOptions">
    :   <dfn>transport</dfn>
    ::  This OPTIONAL member contains a hint as to how the [=server=] might receive the OTP.
        The values SHOULD be members of {{OTPCredentialTransportType}} but [=client platforms=] MUST ignore unknown values.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## `OTPCredentialTransportType` ## {#enum-transport}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<xmp class="idl">
    enum OTPCredentialTransportType {
        "sms",
    };
</xmp>

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="OTPCredentialTransportType">
    User Agents may implement various transport mechanisms to allow
    the retrieval of OTPs. This enumeration defines hints as to how
    user agents may communicate with the transport mechanisms. 

    :   <dfn>sms</dfn>
    ::  Indicates that the OTP is expected to arrive via SMS.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Permissions Policy integration ## {#sctn-permissions-policy}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification defines one [=policy-controlled feature=] identified by
the feature-identifier token "<code><dfn data-lt="otp-credentials-feature" export>otp-credentials</dfn></code>".
Its [=default allowlist=] is '<code>self</code>'. [[!Permissions-Policy]]

A {{Document}}'s [=Document/permissions policy=] determines whether any content in that <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#documents">document</a> is
[=allowed to use|allowed to successfully invoke=] the [=WebOTP API=], i.e., via
<code><a idl for="CredentialsContainer" lt="get()">navigator.credentials.get({otp: { transport: ["sms"]}})</a></code>.
If disabled in any document, no content in the document will be [=allowed to use=]
the foregoing methods: attempting to do so will [return an error](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/promises-guide#errors).

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Using WebOTP within <code>iframe</code> elements ## {#sctn-iframe-guidance}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The [=WebOTP API=] is available in inner frames when the origins match but it's disabled by default in cross-origin <{iframe}>s.
To override this default policy and indicate that a cross-origin <{iframe}> is allowed to invoke the [=WebOTP API=]'s {{[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}} method, specify the <{iframe/allow}> attribute on the <{iframe}> element and include the <code>[=otp-credentials-feature|otp-credentialst=]</code> feature-identifier token in the <{iframe/allow}> attribute's value.

[=[RPS]=] utilizing the WebOTP API in an embedded context should review [[#sctn-seccons-visibility]] regarding [=UI redressing=] and its possible mitigations.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Transports # {#transports}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

We expect a variety of different transport mechanisms to enable OTPs
to be received, most notably via SMS, email and hardware devices.

Each of these transport mechanisms will need their own conventions on
how to provide OTPs to the browser.

In this draft, we leave the API surface to be extensible to any number
of transports.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## SMS ## {#transports-sms}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

One of the most commonly used transport mechanisms for OTP is via
SMS messages, allowing developers to verify phone numbers. They
are typically sent embedded in an SMS message, which gets copied and
pasted by users.

[[sms-one-time-codes]] defines [=origin-bound one-time code messages=], a format for sending OTPs over SMS and associating them with origins.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Security # {#security}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

From a security perspective, there are two considerations with this
API:

* tampering: preventing attacks based on the modification of the message.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Availability ## {#security-availability}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This API is only available on:

* https (or localhost, for development purposes)

This API is also only available via https or localhost (for development
purposes). We don't entirely adopt the concept of trustworthy urls
because it covers more schemes (e.g. data://123) than we would like to
(our initial intuition is that (a) https and localhost covers most
cases and (b) it needs to be clear to the user what public facing
entity its sending the SMS).

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Addressing ## {#security-addressing}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each transport mechanism is responsible for guaranteeing that the
browser has enough information to route the OTP appropriately to the
intended origin.

For example, [=origin-bound one-time code messages=] explicitly
identify the origin on which the OTP can be used.

The addressing scheme must be enforced by the agent to guarantee that
it gets routed appropriately.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Tampering ## {#security-tampering}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

There isn't any built-in cryptographic guarantee that the OTP that is
being handed back by this API hasn't been tampered with. For example,
an attacker could send an [=origin-bound one-time code message=] to the
user's phone with an arbitrary origin which the agent happilly passes
back to the requesting call.

<div class=example>
```
Your verification code is: MUAHAHAHA

@example.com #MUAHAHAHA
```
</div>

It is the responsibility for the caller to:

* put in place the checks necessary to verify that the OTP that was received
    is a valid one, for example:
    * parsing it carefully according to its known formatting expectations
        (e.g. only alpha numeric values),
    * storing and checking OTPs that were sent on a server side database.
* degrade gracefully when an invalid OTP is received (e.g. re-request one).

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Visibility Considerations for Embedded Usage ## {#sctn-seccons-visibility}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Simplistic use of WebOTP in an embedded context, e.g., within <{iframe}>s as described in [[#sctn-iframe-guidance]], may make users vulnerable to <dfn>UI Redressing</dfn> attacks, also known as "[Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking)". This is where an attacker overlays their own UI on top of a [=[RP]=]'s intended UI and attempts to trick the user into performing unintended actions with the [=[RP]=]. For example, using these techniques, an attacker might be able to trick users into purchasing items, transferring money, etc.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Privacy # {#privacy}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

From a privacy perspective, the most notable consideration is for a user agent
to enforce the consensual exchange of information between the user and the
website.

Specifically, this API allows the programatic verification of personally
identifiable attributes of the user, for example email addresses and phone
numbers.

The attack vector that is most frequently raised is a targeted attack:
websites trying to find a **very** specific user accross all of its user
base. In this attack, if left unattended, a website can use this API to
try to find a **specific** user that owns a **specific** phone number by
sending all / some (depending on the confidence level) of its users an
[=origin-bound one-time code message=] and detecting when one is received.

Notably, this API doesn't help with the **acquisition** of the personal
information, but rather with its **verification**. That is, this API helps
**verifying** whether the user owns a specific phone number, but doesn't
help acquiring the phone number in the first place (it assumes that the
website already has access to it).

Nonetheless, the verification of the possession of these attributes is extra
information about the user and should be handled responsibly by a user
agent, typically via **permission prompts** before handing back the OTP
to the website.
