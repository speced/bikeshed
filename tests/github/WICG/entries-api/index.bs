Title: File and Directory Entries API
Shortname: EntriesAPI
Abstract: This specification documents web browser support for file
    and directory upload by drag-and-drop operations. It introduces
    types representing directories with methods for asynchronous
    traversal, and extends {{HTMLInputElement}} and
    {{DataTransferItem}} [[!HTML]].

<h2 id=goals>Goals</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification documents the types and operations made available
by web browsers to script when a hierarchy of files and directories
are dragged and dropped onto a page or selected using form elements,
or equivalent user actions.

This is heavily based upon earlier drafts of [[file-system-api]] which
defines similar types in the context of a sandboxed file system,
including operations for creating and modifying files and directories,
but which has not been broadly adopted by web browsers.

<aside class=note>
  The APIs described by this document was initially implemented in
  Google Chrome. Other browsers (at this time: Edge, Firefox and
  Safari) are starting to support subsets of Chrome's APIs
  and behavior. The intent of this document is to specify the common
  subset to ensure that the implementations are interoperable.

<h2 id=concepts>Concepts</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=names-paths>Names and Paths</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>name</dfn> is a string which:

    * does not contain '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS)
    * does not contain NUL (U+0000)
    * does not contain '\' (U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS)
    * is not '.' (U+002E FULL STOP)
    * is not '..' (U+002E FULL STOP, U+002E FULL STOP)

A <dfn>path segment</dfn> is a [=/name=], '.' (U+002E FULL STOP) or
'..' (U+002E FULL STOP, U+002E FULL STOP).

A <dfn>relative path</dfn> is a string consisting of one or more
[=path segments=] joined by '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS) that does not start
with '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS).

An <dfn>absolute path</dfn> is a string consisting of '/' (U+002F
SOLIDUS) followed by zero or more [=path segments=] joined by '/'
(U+002F SOLIDUS).

A <dfn>path</dfn> is either a [=relative path=] or an [=absolute
path=].

A <dfn>valid path</dfn> is a {{USVString}} which is a [=path=].

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=files-dirs>Files and Directories</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>file</dfn> consists of binary data and a <dfn
for=file>name</dfn> (a non-empty [=/name=]).

A <dfn>directory</dfn> consists of a <dfn for=directory>name</dfn> (a
[=/name=]) and an ordered list of members. Each member is either a
[=file=] or a [=directory=]. Each member of a [=directory=] must have
a distinct non-empty [=/name=].

A <dfn>root directory</dfn> is a [=directory=] that is not a member of
a [=directory=]. A [=root directory=]'s [=/name=] is empty.

The <dfn>parent</dfn> of a [=file=] or [=directory=] is the
[=directory=] it is a member of. A [=root directory=] has no
[=parent=].

<aside class=issue>
  EDITORIAL:
  Should [=directory=] be defined as a special type of [=file=]
  so that minimal changes are necessary in [[HTML]]?
</aside>

<aside class=note>
  In most cases, the files and directories selected by the user will
  be presented by the API as if contained by a <em>virtual root</em>
  that does not exist as an entity in the actual native file system
  backing the interaction with the API.
</aside>

A <dfn>file system</dfn> consists of a <dfn for="file system">name</dfn>
and a <dfn for="file system">root</dfn> which is an associated [=root
directory=]. The [=file system/name=] of a [=/file system=] is a
{{USVString}} which is implementation defined but is unique to the
[=/file system=]. A [=root directory=] is associated with exactly one
[=/file system=].

<aside class=note>
  Implementations could produce a [=file system/name=] by generating a
  UUID for each [=/file system=] instance with some fixed prefix and
  suffix strings applied. Authors using the API are adviised not to make
  assumptions about the structure or content of the names.
</aside>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=entries>Entries</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn id=entry-concept>entry</dfn> is either a <dfn>file entry</dfn>
or a <dfn>directory entry</dfn>.

An [=entry=] has an <dfn for=entry>name</dfn> (a [=/name=]) and a
<dfn>full path</dfn> (an [=absolute path=]).

An [=entry=] also has a <dfn for=entry>root</dfn>, which is an
associated [=root directory=].

<aside class=note>
  [=Entries=] are defined in terms of [=paths=] relative to a [=root
  directory=] to account for the fact that a native file system
  backing the interaction with the API could be modified asynchronously
  during operations such as enumerating the contents of a directory.
  Operations exposed on [=entries=] will produce errors in such cases
  where the [=paths=] no longer reference the same entity.
</aside>

The <dfn for=entry>file system</dfn> of an [=entry=] is the
[=/file system=] associated with the [=entry=]'s [=entry/root=].

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=dir-reader>Directory Reader</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>directory reader</dfn> consists of an associated [=directory
entry=], an associated [=directory=] (initially null), a <dfn>reading
flag</dfn> (initially unset), a <dfn>done flag</dfn> (initially
unset), and a <dfn>reader error</dfn> (initially null).


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2 id=algorithms>Algorithms</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

To <dfn>resolve a relative path</dfn> with |abspath| (an [=absolute
path=]) and |path| (an [=absolute path=], a [=relative path=], or the empty string), run
the following steps which return an [=absolute path=]:

<div class=algorithm>

1. If |path| is an [=absolute path=], return |path|.

2. Let |abspath segments| be the result of [=strictly splitting=]
    |abspath| on '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS).

    <aside class=note>The first string will be empty.</aside>

3. Let |path segments| be the result of [=strictly splitting=]
    |path| on '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS).

4. For each |segment| in |path segments|, switch on |segment|:

    <dl class=switch>

      <dt>empty string
      <dd>Continue.

      <dt>'.' (U+002E FULL STOP)
      <dd>Continue.

      <dt>'..' (U+002E FULL STOP, U+002E FULL STOP)
      <dd>Remove the last member of |abspath segments|
         unless it is the only member.

      <dt>Otherwise
      <dd>Append |segment| to |abspath segments|.

   </dl>

5. Return |abspath segments| joined by '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS).

</div>

To <dfn>evaluate a path</dfn> with |directory| (an [=root directory=])
and |path| (an [=absolute path=]), run the following steps which
return a [=file=], [=directory=], or <em>failure</em>.

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |segments| be the result of [=strictly splitting=] |path| on
    '/' (U+002F SOLIDUS).

2. Remove the first entry from |segments|.

    <aside class=note>Since |path| was an [=absolute path=],
      this first entry will always be empty.</aside>

3. For each |segment| in |segments|, switch on |segment|:

    <dl class=switch>

      <dt>empty string
      <dd>Continue.

      <dt>'.' (U+002E FULL STOP)
      <dd>Continue.

      <dt>'..' (U+002E FULL STOP, U+002E FULL STOP)
      <dd>Let |directory| be |directory|'s [=parent=],
          or |directory| if none.

      <dt>Otherwise
      <dd>
         Run these substeps:

         1. Let |item| be the member of |directory| with [=/name=]
            equal to |segment|, or return <em>failure</em> if none.

         2. If |segment| is the last item in |segments|, return
            |item|.

         3. If |item| is a [=file=], return <em>failure</em>.

         4. Let |directory| be |item|.

<h2 id=file-interface>The {{File}} Interface</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<aside class=issue>
  EDITORIAL:
  This section should be merged into [[FileAPI]] once it is complete.
</aside>

<pre class=idl>
partial interface File {
    readonly attribute USVString webkitRelativePath;
};
</pre>

The {{File/webkitRelativePath}} attribute of the {{File}} interface
must return the [=relative path=] of the file, or the empty string if
not specified.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2 id=html-forms>HTML: Forms</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<aside class=issue>
  EDITORIAL:
  This section should be merged into [[HTML]] once it is complete.
  Sections such as the steps to <em>construct the form data set</em>
  need to be extended to include the {{File/webkitRelativePath}}
  property.
</aside>

<pre class=idl>
partial interface HTMLInputElement {
    attribute boolean webkitdirectory;
    readonly attribute FrozenArray&lt;FileSystemEntry&gt; webkitEntries;
};
</pre>

When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in the [=File
Upload=] state, the rules in this section apply.

The {{HTMLInputElement/webkitdirectory}} attribute is a boolean
attribute that indicates whether the user is to be allowed to select a
directory rather than a file or files. When specified, the behavior on
the selection of a directory is as if all files with that directory as
an ancestor were selected. In addition, the
{{File/webkitRelativePath}} property of each {{File}} is set to a
[=relative path=] from the shortest common ancestor directory of all
selected files to that file, including that ancestor in the path.
(Therefore this may be a subdirectory of the selected directory
rather than the directory itself.)

<aside class=example>
  Given the following directory structure:

  <pre>
    documents/
      to_upload/
        a/
          b/
            c/
              d/
                1.txt
                2.txt
              3.txt
  </pre>

  If the <code>to_upload</code> directory was selected, then
  {{HTMLInputElement/files}} would include:

  * An entry with {{File/name}} == "<code>1.txt</code>" and {{File/webkitRelativePath}} ==  "<code>c/d/1.txt</code>"
  * An entry with {{File/name}} == "<code>2.txt</code>" and {{File/webkitRelativePath}} == "<code>c/d/2.txt</code>"
  * An entry with {{File/name}} == "<code>3.txt</code>" and {{File/webkitRelativePath}} == "<code>c/3.txt</code>"

</aside>

<aside class=note>
  A user agent could represent any hierarchical data as directories
  during a selection operation. For example, on a device that does not
  expose a native file system directly to the user, photo albums could
  be presented as directories if <code>"image/*"</code> is specified
  for the {{HTMLInputElement/accept}} attribute.
</aside>


<aside class=example>
Inspecting the {{File/webkitRelativePath}} properties after a
directory is selected with an <{input}> element:

<pre class=lang-html>
  &lt;input id=b type=file webkitdirectory&gt;
</pre>

<pre class=lang-javascript>
  document.querySelector('#b').addEventListener('change', e => {
    for (let entry of e.target.files)
      console.log(file.name, file.webkitRelativePath);
  });
</pre>
</aside>

The {{HTMLInputElement/webkitEntries}} IDL attribute allows scripts to
access the element's selected entries. On getting, if the IDL
attribute applies, it must return an array of {{FileSystemEntry}}
objects that represent the current [=selected files=] (including
directories, if permitted). If the IDL attribute does not apply, then
it must instead return null.

<aside class=example>
Enumerating entries using {{HTMLInputElement/webkitEntries}}:

<pre class=lang-html>
  &lt;input id=a type=file multiple&gt;
</pre>

<pre class=lang-javascript>
  document.querySelector('#a').addEventListener('change', e => {
    for (let entry of e.target.webkitEntries)
      handleEntry(entry);
  });
</pre>
</aside>

<aside class=issue>
  INTEROP:
  In Chrome, {{HTMLInputElement/webkitEntries}} is only populated as
  the result of a drag-and-drop operation, not when the element is
  clicked. Should we fix this so it is always populated?
</aside>

<aside class=issue>
  INTEROP:
  In Chrome, if {{HTMLInputElement/webkitdirectory}} is specified on a
  {{HTMLInputElement}}, {{HTMLInputElement/webkitEntries}} is not
  populated; the {{HTMLInputElement/files}} collection and
  {{File/webkitRelativePath}} properties must be used instead to
  reconstruct the directory structure. Should we fix this so it is
  always populated?

<h2 id=html-data>HTML: Drag and drop</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<aside class=issue>
  EDITORIAL:
  This section should be merged into [[HTML]] once it is complete.
</aside>

During a <em>drag-and-drop operation</em>, [=file=] and
[=directory=] items are associated with [=entries=]. Each
[=entry=] is a member of a [=root directory=] unique to the
[=drag data store=].

Additionally, each [=directory=] item is represented in the [=drag
data store item list=] as a <i>File</i>. If it is accessed via
{{DataTransferItem/getAsFile()}} a zero-length {{File}} is returned.

<aside class=note>
  A user agent could represent any hierarchical data as files and
  directories during a drag-and-drop operation. For example, audio
  data stored in a relational database with separate tables for albums
  metadata and blobs for tracks could be exposed to script as
  directories and files when dragged from a media player application.
</aside>

<pre class=idl>
partial interface DataTransferItem {
    FileSystemEntry? webkitGetAsEntry();
};
</pre>

The {{DataTransferItem/webkitGetAsEntry()}} method must run the
following steps when invoked:

<div class=algorithm>

1. If the {{DataTransferItem}} object is not in the <a>read/write
    mode</a> or the [=read-only mode=], return null and abort these
    steps.

2. If the [=drag data item kind=] is not <em>File</em>, then return
    null and abort these steps.

3. Return a new {{FileSystemEntry}} object representing the [=entry=].

</div>

<aside class=example>
Handling drag and drop of files and directories:
<pre class=lang-javascript>
elem.addEventListener('dragover', e => {
  // Prevent navigation.
  e.preventDefault();
});
elem.addEventListener('drop', e => {
  // Prevent navigation.
  e.preventDefault();

  // Process all of the items.
  for (let item of e.dataTransfer.items) {
    // kind will be 'file' for file/directory entries.
    if (item.kind === 'file') {
      let entry = item.webkitGetAsEntry();
      handleEntry(entry);
    }
  }
});

</pre>

An {{FileSystemEntry}} has an associated [=entry=].

The {{FileSystemEntry/isFile}} attribute of the {{FileSystemEntry}}
interface must return true if the [=entry=] is a [=file entry=] and
false otherwise.

The {{FileSystemEntry/isDirectory}} attribute of the
{{FileSystemEntry}} interface must return true if the [=entry=] is a
[=directory entry=] and false otherwise.

The {{FileSystemEntry/name}} attribute of the {{FileSystemEntry}}
interface must return the [=entry/name=] of the [=entry=].

The {{FileSystemEntry/fullPath}} attribute of the {{FileSystemEntry}}
interface must return the [=full path=] of the [=entry=].

The {{FileSystemEntry/filesystem}} attribute of the
{{FileSystemEntry}} interface must return the [=entry/file system=] of
the [=entry=].

The <dfn method for=FileSystemEntry>getParent(|successCallback|,
|errorCallback|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run the following
steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. [=Queue a task=] to perform the following substeps:

    1. Let |path| be the result of running the steps to [=resolve a
        relative path=] with the [=entry=]'s [=full path=] and '..'.

    2. Let |item| be the result of running the steps to [=evaluate a
        path=] with the [=entry=]'s [=entry/root=] and |path|.

    3. If |item| is <em>failure</em>, [=invoke the callback=]
        |errorCallback| (if given) with a newly [=exception/created=]
        "{{NotFoundError}}" {{DOMException}}, and terminate these steps.

    4. Let |entry| be a new [=directory entry=] with |item|'s
        [=directory/name=] as [=entry/name=] and |path| as [=full
        path=].

    5. [=Invoke the callback=] |successCallback| with a new
        {{FileSystemDirectoryEntry}} object associated with |entry|.

interface FileSystemDirectoryReader {
    void readEntries(FileSystemEntriesCallback successCallback,
                     optional ErrorCallback errorCallback);
};
callback FileSystemEntriesCallback = void (sequence&lt;FileSystemEntry&gt; entries);
</pre>

A {{FileSystemDirectoryReader}} has an associated [=directory reader=].

The <dfn method
for=FileSystemDirectoryEntry>readEntries(|successCallback|,
|errorCallback|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run the following
steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. If the [=directory reader=]'s [=reading flag=] is set, [=queue a
    task=] to [=invoke the callback=] |errorCallback| with a newly
    [=exception/created=] "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}, and terminate these
    steps.

2. If the [=directory reader=]'s [=reader error=] is not null, [=queue
    a task=] to [=invoke the callback=] |errorCallback| (if given)
    with [=reader error=], and terminate these steps.

3. If the [=directory reader=]'s [=done flag=] is set, [=queue a
    task=] to [=invoke the callback=] |successCallback| with an empty
    sequence and terminate these steps.

4. Set the [=directory reader=]'s [=reading flag=].

5. [=Queue a task=] to perform the following substeps:

    1. Clear the [=directory reader=]'s [=reading flag=].

    2. Let |dir| be the [=directory reader=]'s [=directory=].

    3. If |dir| is null, run these substeps:

        1. Let |dir| be the result of running the steps to [=evaluate
            a path=] with the [=entry=]'s [=entry/root=] and [=full path=].

        2. If |dir| is failure, set the [=directory reader=]'s
            [=reader error=] to a newly [=exception/created=]
            "{{NotFoundError}}" {{DOMException}}, [=invoke the callback=] |errorCallback|
            (if given) with [=reader error=], and terminate these
            steps.

        3. Set the [=directory reader=]'s [=directory=] to |dir|.

    4. Let |entries| be a non-zero number of entries from the
        |dir| that have not yet been produced by this
        [=directory reader=], if any.

    5. If the previous step failed (for example, the [=directory=] was
        deleted or permission is denied), then set the [=directory
        reader=]'s [=reader error=] to an appropriate {{DOMException}},
        [=invoke the callback=] |errorCallback| (if given) with
        [=reader error=], and terminate these steps.

    6. If |entries| is empty, set the [=directory reader=]'s [=done
        flag=].

    7. [=Invoke the callback=] |successCallback| with |entries|.
