**This is a working version and is subject to change.**


Goals {#goals}
==============

The goal of the Private State Token API is to transfer a limited amount of signals across
sites through time in a privacy preserving manner. It achieves this using
privacy pass protocol [[PRIVACY-PASS-ISSUANCE-PROTOCOL]] specified in working
documents of privacy pass working group of IETF [[PRIVACY-PASS-WG]]. Private
State Tokens can be considered as a web platform implementation of Privacy
Pass.

<!--

In a real-world
system relying on anonymous tokens without private metadata bit, if the issuer stops providing
malicious users with tokens, the attacker will know that they have been detected as malicious.
In fact, this information could serve as an incentive to corrupt more users, or to train machine
learning models that detect which malicious behavior goes un-noticed.

https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/072.pdf

-->


Background {#background}
========================

The Private State Token API provides a mechanism for anonymous authentication. The
API provided by the browser does not authenticate clients, instead it facilitates
transfer of authentication information.

Authentication of the clients and token signing are both carried by the same
entity referred to as the **issuer**. This is the joint attester and issuer
architecture described in [[PRIVACY-PASS-ARCHITECTURE]],
[[PRIVACY-PASS-AUTH-SCHEME]].

Browsers store tokens in persistent storage. Navigated origins might fetch/spend
tokens in first party contexts or include third party code that fetch/spend
tokens. Spending tokens is called **redeeming**.

Origins may ask browser to fetch tokens from the issuers of their
choice. Tokens can be redeemed from a different origin than the fetching one.

Private State Tokens API performs cross site anonymous authentication without
using linkable state carrying cookies [[RFC6265]]. Cookies do provide cross
site authentication, however, fail to provide anonymity.

Cookies store large amount of information. [[RFC6265]] requires at least 4096
bytes per cookie and 50 cookies per domain. This means an origin has
50 x 4096 x 2^8 unique identifiers at its disposal. When backed with back end
databases, a server can store arbitrary data for that many unique
users/sessions.

Compared to a cookie, amount of data stored in a Private State Token is very
limited. A token stores a value from a set of six values (think of a value of
an enum type of six possible values). Hence a token stores data between 2 and 3
bits (4 < 6 < 8). This is very small compared to 4096 bytes a cookie can store.

Moreover, Private State Tokens API use cryptographic protocols that prevents
origins to track which tokens they issue to which user. When presented with
their tokens, issuers can verify they issued them, however, can not link the
tokens to the contex they are issued. Cookies do not have this property.

Unlike cookies, storing multiple tokens from an issuer does not deteriorate
privacy of the user due to unlinkability property of the tokens. Private
State Token API allows at most 2 different issuers in a top level origin. This
is to limit the information stored for a user when the issuers are
collaborating.

Private State Token operations rely on [[FETCH]]. A fetch request corresponding to a
specific Private State Token operation can be created and used as a parameter to the
fetch function.

<!--
* how this is not as powerful like cookies, privacy guarantees?
* Between first and second para there is some gap. We should fill in.
* Level of details in privacy is good and important. A high level approach of this before API details.
* Start with use case and scenarios. This would help with people confused with API.
* how do we refer to unsigned/signed bind/clear tokens?
-->


Issuer Public Keys {#issuer-public-keys}
========================================

This section describes the public interfaces that an issuer is required to
support to provide public keys to be used by Private State Token protocols.

An issuer needs to maintain a set of keys and implement the **Issue** and
**Redeem** cryptographic functions to sign and validate tokens. Issuers are
required to serve a **key commitment** endpoint. Key commitments are
collections of cryptographic keys and associated metadata necessary for
executing the issuance and redemption operations. Issuers make these available
through secure HTTP [[RFC8446]] endpoints. Browsers should fetch the key
commitments periodically.

Requests to key commitment endpoints should result in a JSON response
[[RFC8259]] of the following format.

```javascript
{
  <cryptographic protocol_version>: {
    "protocol_version": <cryptographic protocol version>,
    "id": <key commitment identifier>
    "batchsize": <batch size>,
    "keys": {
      <keyID>: { "Y": <base64-encoded public key>,
                 "expiry": <key expirion data>},
      <keyID>: { "Y": <base64-encoded public key>,
                 "expiry": <key expirion data}, ...
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

* `<cryptographic protocol version>` is a string identifier for the Private State Token
    protocol version used. The same string is used as a value of the inner
    `"protocol_version"` field. Protocol version string identifier is either
    `"PrivateStateTokenV3PMB"` or `"PrivateStateTokenV3VOPRF"`. Both protocols have similar
    properties in terms of privacy implications.

    * Protocol version `“PrivateStateTokenV3PMB”` implements [[PMB]] cryptographic
               protocol. In this protocol, each token contains a private
               metadata bit.

    * Protocol version `“PrivateStateTokenV2VOPRF”` implements [[VOPRF]] cryptographic
               protocol. Contrary to PMB, tokens do not contain private
               metadata bits. However, issuers can use twice as many
               concurrently valid token signing keys (six compared to three of
               PMB).

* `"id"` field provides the identifier of the key commitment. It is a string
         representation of a non-negative integer that is within the range of
         an unsigned 32 bit integer type. Values should be montonically
         increasing.

* `"batchsize"` specifies the maximum number of blinded tokens that the issuer
                supports for each token issuance operation. Its value is a
                string representation of a positive integer. Maximum value
                allowed is 100. If a larger value is specified, 100 will be
                used. Browser might send fewer tokens in a single operation,
                but will generally default to sending `batchsize` many tokens
                per operation.

* `"keys"` field is a dictionary of public keys listed by their identifiers.

         * `<keyID>` is a string representation of a non-negative integer that
               is within the range of an unsigned 32 bit integer type.

         * Each key has a `"Y"` field which is a string representation of a
                big-endian base64 encoding [[RFC4648]] of the byte string of
                the key.

         * `"expiry"` field specifies how long the underlying key is valid. It
                      is a string representation of a nonnegative integer that
                      is within the range of an unsigned 64 bit integer type.
                      Underlying key expires if this amount many or more
                      microseconds are elapsed since the POSIX epoch
                      [[RFC8536]].

All field names and their values are strings. When new key commitments are
fetched for an issuer, previous commitments are discarded.

Issuing Protocol {#issuing-protocol}
====================================

This section explains the issuing protocol. It has two sections that explains
the issuing protocol steps happenning in browsers and issuers.

Browser Steps For Creating Issue Request {#browser-issue-steps}
---------------------------------------------------------------

An issue request is created and fetched as demostrated in the following snippet.

```javascript
issueRequest = new Request("https://example.issuer:1234/issuer_path?public=0&private=0", {
  privateStateToken: {
    type: "token-request",
    issuer: "https://example.issuer"
  }
});
fetch(issueRequest);
```

An issuance request is parameterized by issuer and top level origins. The following
steps are carried out when an issue request is fetched.

 1. Reject if the document is not in a secure context [[secure-contexts]].
 2. Reject if associating the issuer with the top level origin would exceed the
           top level’s number-of-issuers limit of 2.
 3. Associate the issuer with the top level origin.
 4. Reject if the number of tokens from the issuer is already at capacity
           which is 500.
 5. Reject if there are no key commitments stored for the issuer.
 6. Pass issuer public keys to cryptographic procedures. Reject if keys are
         malformed.
 7. Discard tokens from issuer that are signed with keys other than those from
            the issuer's most recent commitments.
 8. Compare issuer's max batch size to global limit of 100 on batch size. Use
            the smaller value.
 9. Look up the key commitments from storage. Error out if key commitments are
         unavailable.
 10. Identify right number of tokens considering issuer batch size and current
     number of tokens from the issuer.
 11. Generate the right number of blinded tokens identified in Step 10.
 12. Configure the HTTP request.
               a. Set a load flag to bypass the HTTP cache.
               b. Add `Sec-Private-State-Token` request header containing a
                      base64-encoded version of the bytestring of tokens
                      generated in Step 11.
               c. Add `Sec-Private-State-Token-Version` request header that specifies
                      the version of the cryptographic protocol used.

Private State Token HTTP request headers created for a typical fetch is as follows.

```
Sec-Private-State-Token: <blinded tokens encoded as base64 string>
Sec-Private-State-Token-Version: <cryptographic protocol version, VOPRF or PMB>
```


Issuer Signing Tokens {#issuer-signing-tokens}
----------------------------------------------

This section explains the signing of tokens that happens in the issuer
servers. Information to be encoded in the tokens are passed in the URL `public`
and `private` parameters. VOPRF can only encode a value from set {0,1,2,3,4,5}
passed in the URL `public` parameter. PMB can encode a value from set {0,1,2}
in `public` and a value from set {0,1} in `private` parameter.

Using its private keys, issuer signs the blinded tokens obtained in the
`Sec-Private-State-Token` request header value. Issuer uses the cryptographic protocol
specified in the request `Sec-Private-State-Token-Version` header. Encoding the values
passed in URL `private` and `public` parameters happens in this signing
step. Issuer returns the signed tokens in the `Sec-Private-State-Token` response header
value encoded as a base64 byte string. The number of tokens issued is returned
in `Sec-TT-Count` header. Value of this header is the string message of

```
Issuing <number of tokens> tokens.
```

with the right nonnegative integer value that specifies the tokens issued.

Following snippet displays a typical response demonstrating the Private State Token
related headers.

```
Sec-Private-State-Token: <token encoded as base64 string>
Sec-PST-Count: Issuing 3 tokens.
```


Browser Steps For Issue Response {#browser-issue-response}
----------------------------------------------------------

To process a response to an issue request, browser carries out the following steps.

 1. If the response has no `Sec-Private-State-Token` header, return an error.
 2. If the response has an empty `Sec-Private-State-Token` header, return; this is a
       `Success` response bearing 0 tokens.
 3. Strip the `Sec-Private-State-Token` header from the response and carry out the
    cryptographic procedures to obtain a list of unblinded tokens.
    a. If the cryptographic procedure succeeds, associate the tokens with the
          issuing key’s label and store the tokens.
    b. Else, return an error.


Redeeming Tokens {#redeeming-tokens}
====================================

When browser navigates to an origin, top level origin or a third party site
embedded on the top level origin may redeem tokens stored in browser from a
specific issuer to learn `public` and/or `private` data encoded in the
tokens. Redemption is carried through fetch as demonstrated in the following
snippet.

```javascript
redemptionRequest = new Request('https://example.issuer:1234/redemption_path', {
  privateStateToken: {
    type: 'token-redemption',
    issuer: 'https://example.issuer',
    refreshPolicy: {'none', 'refresh'}
  }
});
```

Default value for refreshPolicy is `'none'`.

<!--
checking fetch syntax, malformed input etc?

When `refreshPolicy` is `'none'`,
browser uses the previously cached redemption record instead of redeeming a new
token.
-->

Browser carries out the following steps when a redemption request is fetched.

 1. Reject if the document is not in a secure context [[secure-contexts]].
 2. Reject if associating the issuer with the top level origin would exceed the
           top level’s number-of-issuers limit of 2.
 3. Associate the issuer with the top level origin.
 4. If `refreshPolicy` is `'none'`,
        a. If an unexpired redemption record exists in permenant storage,
              return early, add this redemption record to corresponding
              header value. Go to step 11.
        b. Else continue redemption.
 5. If this is the third token exhausting redemption request within the
       last 48 hours, return error.
 6. Look up the key commitments from storage. Error out if key commitments are
         unavailable.
 7. Discard tokens from issuer that are signed with keys other than those from
            the issuer's most recent commitments.
 8. Return error if there are no tokens stored to redeem.
 9. Retrieve a single token from persistent storage.
 10. Pass token to cryptographic redemption procedure, if procedure fails
         return error.
 11. Set redemption procedure result in `Sec-Private-State-Token` request header.
 12. Set `Sec-Private-State-Token-Version` header value to the cryptographic protocol
          used.
 13. Optionally, set `Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` header.
 14. Configure the HTTP request. Set a load flag to bypass the HTTP cache.

`Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` response header indicates how long (in seconds) the
RR should be cached for. When `Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` response header value
is invalid (too large, a negative number or non-numeric), UA should ignore the
`Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` header. When `Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` header value
is zero, UA should treat the record as expired. In case of multiple
`Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` headers, UA uses the last one. If
`Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` header is omitted, the lifetime of the RR will be
tied to the lifetime of the Private State Token verification key that confirmed the
redeemed token's issuance. The RR is HTTP-only and JavaScript is only able to
access/send the RR via Private State Token Fetch APIs. The RR is treated as an
arbitrary blob of bytes from the issuer, that may have semantic meaning to
downstream consumers.


Redemption Records {#redemption-records}
----------------------------------------

To reduce communication overhead, the browser might cache blobs returned in
`Sec-Private-State-Token` header value in redemption responses. These blobs are
referred as *Redemption Records*. Browsers might choose to store these records
to include them in subsequent requests to the origins that can verify its
validity. Issuer might choose to include optional `Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime`
header in the redemption response. The value of this header indicates the
expiration time for the redemption record provided. This expiration is
specified as number of seconds in the `Sec-Private-State-Token-Lifetime` HTTP response
header value.


Query APIs {#query-apis}
========================

Token Query {#token-query}
--------------------------

An origin might query whether the browser has any tokens from a specific issuer
using the following API.

```javascript
document.hasPrivateTokens(<issuer>)
```

Browser carries out the following steps on this query.

 1. Reject if the document is not in a secure context [[secure-contexts]].
 2. Reject if associating the issuer with the top level origin would exceed the
           top level’s number-of-issuers limit of 2.
 3. Associate the issuer with the top level origin.
 4. Look up the key commitments from storage. If there are key commitments,
         discard tokens from issuer that are signed with keys other than those
         from the issuer's most recent commitments.
 5. Return true if there are tokens stored for the given issuer, false
           otherwise.

Note that this query modifies the browser state. It associates the issuer
argument with the current origin. Browser allows at most 2 issuers associated
with an origin. This is to prevent leaking information through the issers a
user has tokens from. Note that token query triggers removal of stale tokens
at Step 4.

Redemption Record Query {#redemption-record-query}
--------------------------------------------------

Similar to token query, an origin can check whether browser has a valid
redemption record for a specific issuer using following API.

```javascript
document.hasRedemptionRecord(<issuer>)
```

Browser carries out the following steps on redemption query.

 1. Reject if the document is not in a secure context [[secure-contexts]].
 2. If the issuer is not associated with the top level origin, return false.
 3. Look up the key commitments from storage. If there are key commitments,
         discard tokens from issuer that are signed with keys other than those
         from the issuer's most recent commitments.
 4. If there is a redemption record for the issuer and topl level pair,
       return true, return false otherwise.

Similar to token query, redemption query might modify the browser state. Unlike
token query, redemption query does not associate issuer with the top level
origin. There is no need to associate the issuer queried with the top level
origin, because, answer to the redemption query does not leak information about
the issuers of the currently stored tokens. Similar to token query, redemption
query clears stale tokens.


Privacy Considerations {#privacy}
=================================

Unlinkability {#unlinkability}
------------------------------

Cryptographic protocols [[VOPRF]] and [[PMB]] provide blind signatures. At
redemption time, issuers can recognize their signature on the provided token,
however they can not determine at what time and context they signed the token.
This prevents issuers to correlate their issuances on an origin with
redemptions on another origin. Issuers learn only the aggregate information
about the origins users visit.


Limiting Encoded Information {#limit-encoded-info}
--------------------------------------------------

Browsers enforce limit on the number of keys for an issuer. For [[VOPRF]]
number of keys are limited to six and for [[PMB]] number of keys are limited to
three. This is to prevent issuers de-anonymizing the clients by using a unique
keys for each clients. At issuance time, when using [[VOPRF]], the issuer can
label browser by one of the six available labels by using one of the six keys.
Similarly, when using [[PMB]], the issuer labels the browser in of the three
labels by using its three keys and store an additional private bit value.  This
indicates it also places browser into one of six buckets (2 x 3 = 6). Both
[[VOPRF]] and [[PMB]] encode the same amount of information in a token. The
difference is [[PMB]] having a private bit.

### Potential Attack: Side Channel Fingerprinting

Unlinkability is lost if the issuer is able to use network-level fingerprinting
or any other side-channel and can associate the browser at redemption time with
the browser at token issuance time, even though the Private State Token API
itself has only stored and revealed limited amount of information about the
browser.

Cross-site Information Transfer {#cross-site-info}
--------------------------------------------------

Private State Tokens transfer limited information between first-party contexts.
Underlying cryptographic protocols guarantee that each token only contains a
small amount of information. Still, if we allow many token redemptions on a
single page, the first-party cookie for user U on domain A can be encoded in
the Private State Token information channel and decoded on domain B, allowing
domain B to learn the user's domain A cookie until either 1p cookie is cleared.
Separate from the concern of channels allowing arbitrary communication between
domains, some identification attacks---for instance, a malicious redeemer
attempting to learn the exact set of issuers that have granted tokens to a
particular user, which could be identifying---have similar mitigations.

### Mitigation: Dynamic Issuance/Redemption Limits

To mitigate this attack, browser places limits on both issuance and redemption.
User activation with the issuing site is required in the issuing operation. The
browser does not allow a third redemption in a 48 hour window.

### Mitigation: Per-Site Issuer Limits

The rate of identity leakage from one origin to another increases with the
number of issuers allowed in an origin. To avoid abuse, the browser allows
association of at most two issers per top level origin. Issuers are associated
with top level origins for token query API as well, see [[#token-query]].

Security Considerations {#security}
===================================

Preventing Token Exhaustion {#token-exhaustion}
-----------------------------------------------

Malicious origins might attempt to exhaust all tokens stored in the browser by
redeeming them all. To prevent this, the browser limits number of redemption
operations. In an origin first two redemptions are allowed, however, the third
redemption is not allowed in a 48 hour window. The third redemption is allowed
once more than 48 hours have elapsed since the first redemption.

Preventing Double Spending {#preventing-double-spend}
-----------------------------------------------------

Issuers can verify that each token is seen only once, because every redemption
is sent to the same token issuer. This means that even if a malicious piece of
malware exfiltrates all of a user's tokens, the tokens will run out over time.
Issuers can sign fewer tokens at a time to mitigate the risk.
