# Introduction # {#introduction}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

## Use cases ## {#use-cases}

### Web text references ### {#web-text-references}
The core use case for text fragments is to allow URLs to serve as an exact text
reference across the web. For example, Wikipedia references could link to the
exact text they are quoting from a page. Similarly, search engines can serve
URLs that direct the user to the answer they are looking for in the page rather
than linking to the top of the page.

### User sharing ### {#user-sharing}
With text fragments, browsers may implement an option to 'Copy URL to here'
when the user opens the context menu on a text selection. The browser can then
generate a URL with the text selection appropriately specified, and the
recipient of the URL will have the specified text conveniently indicated.
Without text fragments, if a user wants to share a passage of text from a page,
they would likely just copy and paste the passage, in which case the receiver
loses the context of the page.

# Description # {#description}

## Indication ## {#indication}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

This specification intentionally doesn't define what actions a user agent
should or could take to "indicate" a text match. There are different
experiences and trade-offs a user agent could make. Some examples of possible
actions:

* Providing visual emphasis or highlight of the text passage
* Automatically scrolling the passage into view when the page is navigated
* Activating a UA's find-in-page feature on the text passage
* Providing a "Click to scroll to text passage" notification
* Providing a notification when the text passage isn't found in the page

<div class='note'>
The choice of action can have implications for user security and privacy.  See
the [[#security-and-privacy]] section for details.
</div>

## Syntax ## {#syntax}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

A [=text fragment directive=] is specified in the [=fragment directive=] (see
[[#the-fragment-directive]]) with the following format:
<pre>
#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix]
          context  |-------match-----|  context
</pre>
<em>(Square brackets indicate an optional parameter)</em>

The text parameters are percent-decoded before matching. Dash (-), ampersand
(&), and comma (,) characters in text parameters must be percent-encoded to
avoid being interpreted as part of the text directive syntax.

The only required parameter is textStart. If only textStart is specified, the
first instance of this exact text string is the target text.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=an%20example%20text%20fragment</code> indicates that the
exact text "an example text fragment" is the target text.
</div>

If the textEnd parameter is also specified, then the text directive refers to a
range of text in the page. The target text range is the text range starting at
the first instance of textStart, until the first instance of textEnd that
appears after textStart. This is equivalent to specifying the entire text range
in the textStart parameter, but allows the URL to avoid being bloated with a
long text directive.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=an%20example,text%20fragment</code> indicates that the first
instance of "an example" until the following first instance of "text fragment"
is the target text.
</div>

### Context Terms ### {#context-terms}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

The other two optional parameters are context terms. They are specified by the
dash (-) character succeeding the prefix and preceding the suffix, to
differentiate them from the textStart and textEnd parameters, as any
combination of optional parameters may be specified.

Context terms are used to disambiguate the target text fragment. The context
terms can specify the text immediately before (prefix) and immediately after
(suffix) the text fragment, allowing for whitespace.

<div class="note">
While the context terms must be the immediate text surrounding the target text
fragment, any amount of whitespace is allowed between context terms and the
text fragment. This helps allow context terms to be across element boundaries,
for example if the target text fragment is at the beginning of a paragraph and
it must be disambiguated by the previous element's text as a prefix.
</div>

The context terms are not part of the targeted text fragment and must not be
visually indicated.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=this%20is-,an%20example,-text%20fragment</code> would match
to "an example" in "this is an example text fragment", but not match to "an
example" in "here is an example text".
</div>

### BiDi Considerations ### {#bidi-considerations}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

<div class='note'>
  See <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics.en">Unicode
  Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a> for a good overview of how Bidirectional
  text works.
</div>

Since URL strings are ASCII encoded, they provide no built-in support for
bi-directional text. However, the content that we wish to target on a page may
be LTR (left-to-right), RTL (right-to-left) or both (Bidirectional/BiDi). This
section provides an intuitive description the behavior implicitly described by
the normative sections further in this spec.

The characters of each term in the text fragment are in <em>logical order</em>,
that is, the order in which a native reader would read them in (and also the
order in which characters are stored in memory).

Similarly, the <code>prefix</code> and <code>textStart</code> terms identify
text coming before another term in logical order, while <code>suffix</code> and
<code>textEnd</code> follow other terms in logical order.

Note: user agents may visually render URLs in a manner friendlier to a native
reader, for example, by converting the displayed string to Unicode. However, the
string representation of a URL remains plain ASCII characters.

<div class="example">
  Suppose we want to select the text <code>مِصر‎</code> (Egypt, in Arabic),
  that's preceeded by <code>البحرين‎</code> (Bahrain, in Arabic). We would
  first percent encode each term:

  <code>مِصر‎</code> becomes "%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1" (Note: UTF-8 character
  [0xD9,0x85] is the first (right-most) character of the Arabic word.)

  <code>البحرين‎</code> becomes "%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86"

  The text fragment would then become:

  <code>
    :~:text=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-,%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1
  </code>

  When displayed in a browser's address bar, the browser may visually render the
  text in its natural RTL direction, appearing to the user:

  <code>
    :~:text=البحرين-,مِصر
  </code>
</div>

## The Fragment Directive ## {#the-fragment-directive}

To avoid compatibility issues with usage of existing URL fragments, this spec
introduces the [=fragment directive=]. The [=fragment directive=] is a portion
of the URL [=url/fragment=] that follows the [=fragment directive delimiter=].

The <dfn>fragment directive delimiter</dfn> is the string ":~:", that is the
three consecutive code points U+003A (:), U+007E (~), U+003A (:).

<div class="note">
  The [=fragment directive=] is part of the URL fragment. This means it must
  always appear after a U+0023 (#) code point in a URL.
</div>

<div class="example">
  To add a [=fragment directive=] to a URL like https://example.com, a fragment
  must first be appended to the URL: https://example.com#:~:text=foo.
</div>

The fragment directive is meant to carry instructions, such as
<code>text=</code>, for the UA rather than for the document.

To prevent impacting page operation, it is stripped from a [=Document=]'s
[=Document/URL=] so that author scripts can't directly interact with it. This
also ensures future directives could be added without introducing breaking
changes to existing content.  Potential examples could be: image-fragments,
translation-hints.


### Processing the fragment directive ### {#processing-the-fragment-directive}

The fragment directive is processed and removed from the fragment whenever the
UA sets the [=Document/URL=] on a [=Document=]. This is defined with the
following additions and changes.

To the definition of [=Document=], add:

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[DOM]]:</strong>
>
>   <em>
>     Each document has an associated <dfn>fragment directive</dfn> which is
>     either null or an ASCII string holding data used by the UA to process the
>     resource. It is initially null.
>   </em>

Whenever the fragment directive is stripped from the URL, it is set to the
Document's [=fragment directive=].

Add a series of steps that will process a fragment directive on a [=Document/URL=]:

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[DOM]]:</strong>
>
>   To <dfn>process and consume fragment directive</dfn> from a [=/URL=]
>   |url| and [=Document=] |document|, run these steps:
>   1. Let |raw fragment| be equal to |url|'s [=url/fragment=].
>   1. If |raw fragment| is non-null and contains the [=fragment directive
>       delimiter=] as a substring:
>       1. Let |fragmentDirectivePosition| be the index of the first instance
>           of the [=fragment directive delimiter=] in |raw fragment|.
>       1. Let |fragment| be the substring of |raw fragment| starting at 0 of
>           count |fragmentDirectivePosition|.
>       1. Advance |fragmentDirectivePosition| by the length of [=fragment
>           directive delimiter=].
>       1. Let |fragment directive| be the substring of |raw fragment| starting
>           at |fragmentDirectivePosition|.
>       1. Set |url|'s [=url/fragment=] to |fragment|.
>       1. Set |document|'s [=fragment directive=] to |fragment directive|.
>           <div class="note">This is stored on the document but currently not
>           web-exposed</div>

<div class="note">
  These changes make a URL's fragment end at the [=fragment directive
  delimiter=]. The [=fragment directive=] includes all characters that follow,
  but not including, the delimiter.
</div>

<div class="example">
<code>https://example.org/#test:~:text=foo</code> will be parsed such that
the fragment is the string "test" and the [=fragment directive=] is the string
"text=foo".
</div>


Amend the
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#initialise-the-document-object">
create and initialize a Document object</a> steps to parse and remove the

step 6).

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[HTML]]:</strong>

<div class="note">
  <p>
    The changes in this section imply that a URL is only stripped of its fragment
    directive when it is set on a Document. Notably, since a window's
    {{Location}} object is a representation of the [=/URL=] of the [=active
    document=], all getters on it will show a fragment-directive-stripped
    version of the URL.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some examples should help clarify various edge cases.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="example">
  ```
  window.location = 'https://example.com#foo:~:bar';
  ```

  The page loads and when the document's URL is set the fragment directive is
  stripped out during the "create and initialize a Document object" steps.

  ```
  console.log(window.location.href); // 'https://example.com#foo'
  console.log(window.location.hash); // '#foo'
  ```

  Since same document navigations are made by adding a new session history
  entry and using the "traverse the history" steps, the the fragment directive
  will be stripped here as well.

  ```
  window.location.hash = 'fizz:~:buzz';
  console.log(window.location.href); // 'https://example.com#fizz'
  console.log(window.location.hash); // '#fizz'
  ```

  The hashchange event is dispatched when only the fragment directive changes
  because the comparison for it is done on the URLs in the session history
  entries, where the fragment directive hasn't been removed.

  ```
  onhashchange = () => {console.log('HASHCHANGE');};
  window.location.hash = 'fizz:~:zillch'; // 'HASHCHANGE'
  console.log(window.location.href); // 'https://example.com#fizz'
  console.log(window.location.hash); // '#fizz'
  ```
</div>

<div class="example">
  In other cases where a Document's URL is not set by the UA, there is no
  fragment directive stripping.

  For URL objects:

  ```
  let url = new URL('https://example.com#foo:~:bar');
  console.log(url.href); // 'https://example.com#foo:~:bar'
  console.log(url.hash); // '#foo:~:bar'

  document.url = url;
  console.log(document.url.href); // 'https://example.com#foo:~:bar'
  console.log(document.url.hash); // '#foo:~:bar'

  ```

  The `<a>` or `<area>` elements:

  ```
  <a id='anchor' href="https://example.com#foo:~:bar">Anchor</a>
  <script>
    console.log(anchor.href); // 'https://example.com#foo:~:bar'
    console.log(anchor.hash); // '#foo:~:bar'
  </script>
  ```
</div>

<div class="example">
  History pushState will create a session history entry where the URL's
  fragment directive isn't stripped. However, traversing to the entry will
  cause it to set its URL on the document which will process the fragment
  directive before setting it on the Document (but the fragment directive
  remains on the entry).


  ```
  history.pushState({}, 'title', 'index.html#foo:~:bar');
  window.location = 'newpage.html';
  // on newpage.html
  history.back();
  ```

  Results in the current document having "bar" as the fragment directive.
</div>


### Parsing the fragment directive ### {#parsing-the-fragment-directive}

A <dfn>ParsedTextDirective</dfn> is a <a spec=infra>struct</a> that consists of
four strings: <dfn for="ParsedTextDirective">textStart</dfn>,
<dfn for="ParsedTextDirective">textEnd</dfn>,
<dfn for="ParsedTextDirective">prefix</dfn>, and
<dfn for="ParsedTextDirective">suffix</dfn>. [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=]
is required to be non-null. The other three items may be set to null,
indicating they weren't provided. The empty string is not a valid value for any
of these items.

See [[#syntax]] for the what each of these components means and how they're
used.

<div algorithm="parse a text directive">

To <dfn>parse a text directive</dfn>, on an <a spec="infra">ASCII string</a> |text
directive input|, run these steps:

<div class="note">
  <p>
    This algorithm takes a single text directive string as input (e.g.
    "text=prefix-,foo,bar") and attempts to parse the string into the
    components of the directive (e.g. ("prefix", "foo", "bar", null)). See
    [[#syntax]] for the what each of these components means and how they're
    used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns null if the input is invalid or fails to parse in any way.
    Otherwise, returns a [=ParsedTextDirective=].
  </p>
</div>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1. [=/Assert=]: |text directive input| matches the production [=TextDirective=].
    1. Let |textDirectiveString| be the substring of |text directive
        input| starting at index 5.
        <div class="note">
          This is the remainder of the |text directive input| following,
          but not including, the "text=" prefix.

    1. Let |tokens| be a <a for=/>list</a> of strings that is the result of
        <a lt="split on commas">splitting |textDirectiveString| on commas</a>.
    1. If |tokens| has size less than 1 or greater than 4, return null.
    1. If any of |tokens|'s items are the empty string, return null.
    1. Let |retVal| be a [=ParsedTextDirective=] with each of its items initialized
        to null.
    1. Let |potential prefix| be the first item of |tokens|.
    1. If the last character of |potential prefix| is U+002D (-), then:
        1. Set |retVal|'s [=ParsedTextDirective/prefix=] to the
            [=string/percent-decode|percent-decoding=] of the result of removing the

    1. Let |potential suffix| be the last item of |tokens|, if one exists, null
        otherwise.
    1. If |potential suffix| is non-null and its first character is U+002D (-),
        then:
        1. Set |retVal|'s [=ParsedTextDirective/suffix=] to the
            [=string/percent-decode|percent-decoding=] of the result of removing the
            first character from |potential suffix|.
        1. <a spec=infra for=list>Remove</a> the last item of the list |tokens|.
    1. If |tokens| has <a spec=infra for=list>size</a> not equal to 1 nor 2 then
        return null.
    1. Set |retVal|'s [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=] be the
        [=string/percent-decode|percent-decoding=] of the first item of |tokens|.
    1. If |tokens| has <a spec=infra for=list>size</a> 2, then set |retVal|'s
        [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=] be the
        [=string/percent-decode|percent-decoding=] of the last item of |tokens|.
    1. Return |retVal|.
  </ol>
</div>

### Fragment directive grammar ### {#fragment-directive-grammar}

A <dfn>valid fragment directive</dfn> is a sequence of characters that appears
in the [=fragment directive=] that matches the production:
<dl>
  <code>
    <dt>
      <dfn id="fragmentdirectiveproduction">FragmentDirective</dfn> ::=
    </dt>
    <dd>
      ([=TextDirective=] | [=UnknownDirective=]) ("&" [=FragmentDirective=])?
    </dd>
  </code>
  <code>
    <dt>
      <dfn>UnknownDirective</dfn> ::=
    </dt>
    <dd>
      [=CharacterString=]
    </dd>
  </code>
  <code>
    <dt>
      <dfn>CharacterString</dfn> ::=

    <dd>
      ([=ExplicitChar=] | [=PercentEncodedChar=])+
    </dd>
  </code>
  <code>
    <dt>
      <dfn>ExplicitChar</dfn> ::=

  <div class = "note">
    An [=ExplicitChar=] may be any [=URL code point=].
  </div>
</dl>

<div class="note">
  The [=FragmentDirective=] may contain multiple directives split by the "&"
  character. Currently this means we allow multiple text directives to enable
  multiple indicated strings in the page, but this also allows for future
  directive types to be added and combined. For extensibility, we do not fail to
  parse if an unknown directive is in the &-separated list of directives.
</div>

The <dfn>text fragment directive</dfn> is one such [=fragment directive=] that

## Security and Privacy ## {#security-and-privacy}

### Motivation ### {#motivation}

<div class="note">This section is non-normative</div>

Care must be taken when implementing [=text fragment directive=] so that it
cannot be used to exfiltrate information across origins. Scripts can navigate a
page to a cross-origin URL with a [=text fragment directive=]. If a malicious
actor can determine that the text fragment was successfully found in victim
page as a result of such a navigation, they can infer the existence of any text
on the page.

The following subsections restrict the feature to mitigate the expected attack
vectors. In summary, the text fragment directives are invoked only on full
(non-same-page) navigations that are the result of a user activation.
Additionally, navigations originating from a different origin than the
destination will require the navigation to take place in a "noopener" context,
such that the destination page is known to be sufficiently isolated.

### Scroll On Navigation ### {#scroll-on-navigation}

A UA may choose to automatically scroll a matched text passage into view. This
can be a convenient experience for the user but does present some risks that
implementing UAs should be aware of.

There are known (and potentially unknown) ways a scroll on navigation might be
detectable and distinguished from natural user scrolls.

<div class="example">
  An origin embedded in an iframe in the target page registers an
  IntersectionObserver and determines in the first 500ms of page load whether
  a scroll has occurred. This scroll can be indicative of whether the text
  fragment was successfully found on the page.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Two users share the same network on which traffic is visible between them.
  A malicious user sends the victim a link with a text fragment to a
  page. The searched-for text appears nearby to a resource located on a unique
  (on the page) domain. The attacker may be able to infer the success or failure
  of the fragment search based on the order of requests for DNS lookup.
</div>

<div class="example">
  A malicious page embeds a cross-origin victim in an iframe. The victim page
  contains information sensitive to the user. The malicious page navigates the
  victim to a text fragment. Since a successful fragment match will cause
  focus, the malicious page can determine if the text appears in the victim by
  listening for a blur event in its own document.
</div>

<div class="example">
  An attacker sends a link to a victim, sending them to a page that displays
  a private token. The attacker asks the victim to read back the token. Using
  a text fragment, the attacker gets the page to load for the victim such that
  warnings about keeping the token secret are scrolled out of view.
</div>

All known cases like this rely on specific circumstances about the target page
so don't apply generally. With additional restrictions about when the text
fragment can invoke an attacker is further restricted. Nonetheless, different
UAs can come to different conclusions about whether these risks are acceptable.
UAs should consider these factors when determining whether to scroll as part of
navigating to a text fragment.

Conforming UAs may choose not to scroll automatically on navigation. Such UAs
may, instead, provide UI to initiate the scroll ("click to scroll") or none
at all. In these cases UA should provide some indication to the user that an
indicated passage exists further down on the page.

The examples above illustrate that in specific circumstances, it may be
possible for an attacker to extract 1 bit of information about content on the
page.  However, care must be taken so that such opportunities cannot be
exploited to extract arbitrary content from the page by repeating the attack.
For this reason, restrictions based on user activation and browsing context
isolation are very important and must be implemented.

<div class="note">
  Browsing context isolation ensures that no other document can script the
  target document which helps reduce the attack surface.

  However, it also ensures any malicious use is difficult to hide. A browsing
  context that's the only one in a group must be a top level browsing context
  (i.e. a full tab/window).
</div>

If a UA does choose to scroll automatically, it must ensure no scrolling is
performed while the document is in the background (for example, in an inactive
tab). This ensures any malicious usage is visible to the user and prevents
attackers from trying to secretly automate a search in background documents.

### Search Timing ### {#search-timing}

A naive implementation of the text search algorithm could allow information
exfiltration based on runtime duration differences between a matching and non-
matching query. If an attacker could find a way to synchronously navigate
to a [=text fragment directive=]-invoking URL, they would be able to determine
the existence of a text snippet by measuring how long the navigation call takes.

<div class="note">
  The restrictions in [[#restricting-the-text-fragment]] should prevent this
  specific case; in particular, the no-same-document-navigation restriction.
  However, these restrictions are provided as multiple layers of defence.
</div>

For this reason, the implementation <em>must ensure the runtime of
[[#navigating-to-text-fragment]] steps does not differ based on whether a match
has been successfully found</em>.

This specification does not specify exactly how a UA achieves this as there are
multiple solutions with differing tradeoffs. For example, a UA <em>may</em>
continue to walk the tree even after a match is found in [=find a range from a
text directive=].  Alternatively, it <em>may</em> schedule an asynchronous task
to find and set the indicated part of the document.

### Restricting the Text Fragment ### {#restricting-the-text-fragment}

Amend the definition of a [=/request=] and of a [=Document=] to include a new
field for the [=document/textFragmentToken=]:

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[FETCH]]:</strong>
>
>   A [=/request=] has an associated <dfn for="request">textFragmentToken</dfn> flag

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[HTML]]:</strong>
>
>   A [=Document=] has a <dfn for="document">textFragmentToken</dfn> flag that is
>   consumed in order to allow a single activation of a text fragment. This flag is
>   generated only during loading if the navigation occurs as a result of a user
>   activation.
>
>   If the [=Document=]'s [=document/textFragmentToken=] isn't consumed to activate
>   a text fragment, it may be consumed to set the [=request/textFragmentToken=]
>   flag of a navigation [=/request=]. In this way, a [=document/textFragmentToken=]
>   can be propagated from one [=Document=] to another across a navigation.
>
>   Reading either the [=Document=]'s [=document/textFragmentToken=] or the
>   [=/request=]'s [=request/textFragmentToken=] must always consume the value,
>   such that the token cannot be cloned.

<div class="note">
  <p>
    A [=document/textFragmentToken=] is generated when a [=Document=] is loaded
    as a result of a user gesture. It grants its holder permission (in terms of
    user activation) to activate a single text fragment. Alternatively, it may be
    propagated through a navigation to allow a future document to activate a text
    fragment from this navigation's user gesture.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mechanism allows text fragments to activate through a common redirect
    technique used my many popular web sites. Such sites redirect users to
    their intended destination by responding with a 200 status code containing
    script to set the <tt>window.location</tt>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike real HTTP (<tt>status 3xx</tt>) redirects, these "client-side"
    redirects cannot propagate the fact that the navigation is the result of a
    user gesture. The [=document/textFragmentToken=] mechanism allows passing
    through this specifically scoped user-activation through such navigations.
    This means a page can programmatically navigate to a text fragment, a
    single time, as if it has a user gesture. However, further navigations
    require a new user gesture.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following diagram demonstrates how the token is used to activate a text
    fragment through a client-side redirect service:
  </p>

>   A [=Document=] has an <dfn for="document">allowTextFragmentDirective</dfn>
>   flag that is used to determine whether a text fragment directive should be
>   allowed to activate. If this flag is false, the text fragment must not
>   cause any observable effects.

<div class="note">
  <p>
    [=document/textFragmentToken=] is analogous to a user-activation state
    while [=allowTextFragmentDirective=] is more comprehensive, taking into
    account various pieces of information, one of which is the existence of a
    textFragmentToken.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason we compute allowTextFragmentDirective and keep it as a flag,
    rather than performing the checks at the time of use, is that it relies on
    the properties of the navigation while the invocation will occur as part of
    the <a spec=HTML>scroll to the fragment</a> steps which can happen outside
    the context of a navigation.

The text fragment specification proposes an amendment to

### Finding Ranges in a Document ### {#finding-ranges-in-a-document}

<div class="note">
  This section outlines several algorithms and definitions that specify how to
  turn a full fragment directive string into a list of [=Ranges=] in the
  document.

  At a high level, we take a fragment directive string that looks like this:
  <pre>
    text=prefix-,foo&unknown&text=bar,baz
  </pre>

  We break this up into the individual text directives:

  <pre>
    text=prefix-,foo
    text=bar,baz
  </pre>

  For each text directive, we perform a search in the document for the first
  instance of rendered text that matches the restrictions in the directive.
  Each search is independent of any others; that is, the result is the same
  regardless of how many other directives are provided or their match result.

  If a directive successfully matches to text in the document, it returns a
  [=range=] indicating that match in the document. The [=process a fragment
  directive=] steps are the high level API provided by this section. These
  return a <a spec=infra>list</a> of [=ranges=] that were matched by the
  individual directive matching steps, in the order the directives were
  specified in the fragment directive string.

  If a directive was not matched, it does not add an item to the returned
  list.
</div>

<div algorithm="process a fragment directive">
To <dfn>process a fragment directive</dfn>, given as input an <a
spec=infra>ASCII string</a> |fragment directive input| and a [=Document=]

<div algorithm="find a range from a text directive">
To <dfn>find a range from a text directive</dfn>, given a
[=ParsedTextDirective=] |parsedValues| and [=Document=] |document|, run the
following steps:

<div class="note">
  This algorithm takes as input a successfully parsed text directive and a
  document in which to search. It returns a [=range=] that points to the first
  text passage within the document that matches the searched-for text and
  satisfies the surrounding context. Returns null if no such passage exists.

  [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=] may be null. If omitted, this is an "exact"
  search and the returned [=range=] must contain a string exactly matching
  [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=]. If [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=] is
  provided, this is a "range" search; the returned [=range=] must start with
  [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=] and end with
  [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=]. In the normative text below, we'll call a
  text passage that matches the provided [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=] and
  [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=], regardless of which mode we're in, the
  "matching text".

  Either or both of [=ParsedTextDirective/prefix=] and
  [=ParsedTextDirective/suffix=] may be null, in which case context on that
  side of a match is not checked. E.g. If [=ParsedTextDirective/prefix=] is
  null, text is matched without any requirement on what text precedes it.
</div>
<div class="note">
  While the matching text and its prefix/suffix can span across
  block-boundaries, the individual parameters to these steps cannot. That is,
  each of [=ParsedTextDirective/prefix=], [=ParsedTextDirective/textStart=],
  [=ParsedTextDirective/textEnd=], and [=ParsedTextDirective/suffix=] will only
  match text within a single block.

  <div class="example">
    <pre>:~:text=The quick,lazy dog</pre> will fail to match in

    ```
    <div>The<div> </div>quick brown fox</div>
    <div>jumped over the lazy dog</div>
    ```

    because the starting string "The quick" does not appear within a single,
    uninterrupted block. The instance of "The quick" in the document has a
    block element between "The" and "quick".

    It does, however, match in this example:

    ```
    <div>The quick brown fox</div>
    <div>jumped over the lazy dog</div>
    ```

    The basic premise of this algorithm is to walk all searchable text nodes

    determine offsets with a node so we can return a [=range=].

### Word Boundaries ### {#word-boundaries}
<div class="note">
  Limiting matching to word boundaries is one of the mitigations to limit
  cross-origin information leakage.
</div>
<div class="note">
  See <a
  href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter">Intl.Segmenter</a>, a
  proposal to specify unicode segmentation, including word segmentation. Once
  specified, this algorithm may be improved by making use of the Intl.Segmenter
  API for word boundary matching.
</div>

<p>
  A <dfn>word boundary</dfn> is defined in [[!UAX29]] in
  [[UAX29#Word_Boundaries]]. [[UAX29#Default_Word_Boundaries]] defines a
  default set of what constitutes a word boundary, but as the specification
  mentions, a more sophisticated algorithm should be used based on the locale.
</p>
<p>
  Dictionary-based word bounding should take specific care in locales without a
  word-separating character. E.g. In English, words are separated by the space
  character (' '); however, in Japanese there is no character that separates one
  word from the next. In such cases, and where the alphabet contains fewer
  than 100 characters, the dictionary must not contain more than 20% of the
  alphabet as valid, one-letter words.
</p>

A <dfn>locale</dfn> is a <a spec=infra>string</a> containing a valid [[BCP47]]
language tag, or the empty string. An empty string indicates that the primary
language is unknown.

A substring is <dfn>word bounded</dfn> in a <a spec=infra>string</a> |text|,
given [=locales=] |startLocale| and |endLocale|, if both the position of its
first character [=is at a word boundary=] given |startLocale|, and the position
after its last character [=is at a word boundary=] given |endLocale|.

A number |position| <dfn>is at a word boundary</dfn> in a <a spec=infra>string</a>
|text|, given a [=locale=] |locale|, if, using |locale|, either a [=word
boundary=] immediately precedes the |position|th code unit, or |text|'s length
is more than 0 and |position| equals either 0 or |text|'s length.

<div class="note">
  Intuitively, a substring is [=word bounded=] if it neither begins nor ends in
  the middle of a word.

  In languages with a word separator (e.g. " " space) this is (mostly)
  straightforward; though there are details covered by the above technical
  reports such as new lines, hyphenations, quotes, etc.

  Some languages do not have such a separator (notably,
  Chinese/Japanese/Korean). Languages such as these requires dictionaries to
  determine what a valid word in the given locale is.
</div>

<div class="example">
  <p>
    Text fragments are restricted such that match terms, when combined with
    their adjacent context terms, must be word bounded. For example, in an
    exact search like <code>prefix,textStart,suffix</code>,
    <code>"prefix+textStart+suffix"</code> must be word bounded. However, in a
    range search like <code>prefix,textStart,textEnd,suffix</code>, both
    <code>"prefix+textStart"</code> and <code>"textEnd+suffix"</code> must be
    word bounded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is that a third-party must already know the full tokens they are
    matching against. A range match like <code>textStart,textEnd</code> must be
    word bounded on the inside of the two terms; otherwise a third party could
    use this repeatedly to try and reveal a token (e.g. on a page with
    <code>"Balance: 123,456 $"</code>, a third-party could set
    <code>prefix="Balance: ", textEnd="$"</code> and vary <code>textStart</code>
    to try and guess the numeric token one digit at a time).

  </p>
</div>

<div class="example">
  The substring "mountain range" is word bounded within the string "An impressive
  mountain range" but not within "An impressive mountain ranger".
</div>

<div class="example">
  In the Japanese string "ウィキペディアへようこそ" (Welcome to Wikipedia),
  "ようこそ" (Welcome) is considered word-bounded but "ようこ" is not.
</div>

## Indicating The Text Match ## {#indicating-the-text-match}

The UA may choose to scroll the text fragment into view as part of the <a
spec=HTML>try to scroll to the fragment</a> steps or by some other mechanism;
however, it is not required to scroll the match into view.

The UA should visually indicate the matched text in some way such that the user
is made aware of the text match, such as with a high-contrast highlight.

The UA should provide to the user some method of dismissing the match, such
that the matched text no longer appears visually indicated.

The exact appearance and mechanics of the indication are left as UA-defined.
However, the UA must not use the Document's <a
href="https://w3c.github.io/selection-api/#dfn-selection">selection</a> to
indicate the text match as doing so could allow attack vectors for content
exfiltration.

The UA must not visually indicate any provided context terms.

Since the indicator is not part of the document's content, UAs should consider
ways to differentiate it from the page's content as perceived by the user.

<div class="example">
  The UA could provide an in-product help prompt the first few times the
  indicator appears to help train the user that it comes from the linking page
  and is provided by the UA.
</div>

### URLs in UA features ### {#urls-in-ua-features}

<div class='note'>
  This section is non-normative.
</div>

UAs provide a number of consumers for a document's URL (outside of programmatic
APIs like <code>window.location</code>). Examples include a location bar
indicating the URL of the currently visible document, or the URL used when a
user requests to create a bookmark for the current page.

To avoid user confusion, UAs should be consistent in whether such URLs include
the [=fragment directive=]. This section provides a default set of
recommendations for how UAs should handle these cases.

<div class='note'>
  <p>
  We provide these as a baseline for consistent behavior; however, as these
  features don't affect cross-UA interoperability, they are not strict
  conformance requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
  Exact behavior is left up to the implementing UA which may have differing
  constraints or reasons for modifying the behavior. e.g. UAs may allow users
  to configure defaults or expose UI options so users can choose whether they
  prefer to include fragment directives in these URLs.

  It's also useful to allow UAs to experiment with providing a better
  experience. E.g. perhaps a URL should elide the text fragment if the user
  scrolls it out of view?
  </p>
</div>

The general principle is that a URL should include the [=fragment directive=]
only while the visual indicator is visible (i.e. not dismissed). If the user
dismisses the indicator, the URL should not include the [=fragment directive=].

If the URL includes a text fragment but a match wasn't found in the current
page, the UA may choose to omit it from the exposed URL.

<div class='note'>
  <p>
  A text fragment that isn't found on the page may be useful information to
  surface to a user to indicate that the page may have changed since the link
  was created.
  </p>

  <p>
  However, it's unlikely to be useful to the user in a bookmark.
  </p>
</div>

A few common examples are provided below.

<div class='note'>
  We use "text fragment" and "fragment directive" interchangeably here as text
  fragments are assumed to be the only kind of directive. Should additional
  directives be added in the future, the UX in these cases may have to be
  re-evaluated separately for new directive types.
</div>

#### Location Bar #### {#urls-in-location-bar}

The location bar's URL should include a text fragment while it is visually
indicated. The [=fragment directive=] should be stripped from the location bar
URL when the user dismisses the indication.

It is recommended that the text fragment be displayed in the location bar's URL
even if a match wasn't located in the document.

#### Bookmarks #### {#urls-in-bookmarks}

Many UAs provide a "bookmark" feature allowing users to store a convenient link
to the current page in the UA's interface.

A newly created bookmark should, by default, include the [=fragment directive=]
in the URL if, and only if, a match was found and the visual indicator hasn't
been dismissed.

Navigating to a URL from a bookmark should process a [=fragment directive=] as
if it were navigated to in a typical navigation.

#### Sharing #### {#urls-in-sharing}

Some UAs provide a method for users to share the current page with others,
typically by providing the URL to another app or messaging service.

When providing a URL in these situations, it should include the [=fragment
directive=] if, and only if, a match was found and the visual indicator hasn't
been dismissed.

## Document Policy Integration ## {#document-policy-integration}

<!-- TODO:Replace manual links with autolinks to document-policy definitions
          once it's referrable.  Also remember to autolink the ref in the
          navigating-to-text-fragment section -->

This specification defines a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point">configuration point</a>
in [[!document-policy|Document Policy]] with name "force-load-at-top". Its
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point-type">type</a> is `boolean`
with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point-default-value">default value</a>
`false`.

<div class="note">
  When enabled, this policy disables all automatic scroll-on-load features:
  text-fragments, element fragments, history scroll restoration.
</div>
<div class='example'>
  Suppose the user navigates to `https://example.com#:~:text=foo`. The
  example.com server response includes the header:

  ```
  Document-Policy: force-load-at-top
  ```

  When the page loads, the element containing "foo" will be marked as the
  indicated part of the document and set as the document's target element.
  However, "foo" will not be scrolled into view.
</div>

Fragment-based scroll blocking from this policy is specified in an amendment to the
<a spec=HTML>scroll to the fragment</a> algorithm in the
[[#navigating-to-text-fragment]] section of this document.

History scroll restoration is blocked by amending the <a spec="HTML">restore
persisted state</a> steps by inserting a new step after 2:

3. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#algo-get-policy-value">Get
    the document policy value</a> of the "force-load-at-top" feature for the [=Document=]. If
    the result is true, then the user agent should not restore the scroll
    position for the [=Document=] or any of its scrollable regions. Scroll
    positions for [=child browsing contexts=] should be restored based on the
    value of this policy in the child [=Document=].


## Feature Detectability ## {#feature-detectability}

For feature detectability, we propose adding a new FragmentDirective interface
that is exposed via <code>document.fragmentDirective</code> if the UA supports
the feature.

<pre class='idl'>
  [Exposed=Window]
  interface FragmentDirective {
  };
</pre>

We amend the {{Document}} interface to include a <code>fragmentDirective</code>
property:

<pre class='idl'>
  partial interface Document {
      [SameObject] readonly attribute FragmentDirective fragmentDirective;
  };
</pre>

This object may be used to expose additional information about the text
fragment or other fragment directives in the future.

# Generating Text Fragment Directives # {#generating-text-fragment-directives}

<div class='note'>
  This section is non-normative.
</div>

This section contains recommendations for UAs automatically generating URLs
with a [=text fragment directive=]. These recommendations aren't normative but
are provided to ensure generated URLs result in maximally stable and usable
URLs.

## Prefer Exact Matching To Range-based ## {#prefer-exact-matching-to-range-based}

The match text can be provided either as an exact string "text=foo%20bar%20baz"
or as a range "text=foo,bar".

UAs should prefer to specify the entire string where practical. This ensures
that if the destination page is removed or changed, the intended destination can
still be derived from the URL itself.

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing quoting the sentence:

  <pre>
    The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the
    1931 paper "The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of
    Physical Phenomena" by C. E. Wynn-Williams.
  </pre>

  We could create a range-based match like so:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded,Williams">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded,Williams</a>

  Or we could encode the entire sentence using an exact match term:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20idea%20of%20using%20digital%20electronics%20for%20computing%20was%20the%201931%20paper%20%22The%20Use%20of%20Thyratrons%20for%20High%20Speed%20Automatic%20Counting%20of%20Physical%20Phenomena%22%20by%20C.%20E.%20Wynn-Williams">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20idea%20of%20using%20digital%20electronics%20for%20computing%20was%20the%201931%20paper%20%22The%20Use%20of%20Thyratrons%20for%20High%20Speed%20Automatic%20Counting%20of%20Physical%20Phenomena%22%20by%20C.%20E.%20Wynn-Williams</a>

  The range-based match is less stable, meaning that if the page is changed to
  include another instance of "The first recorded" somewhere earlier in the
  page, the link will now target an unintended text snippet.

  The range-based match is also less useful semantically. If the page is
  changed to remove the sentence, the user won't know what the intended
  target was. In the exact match case, the user can read, or the UA can
  surface, the text that was being searched for but not found.
</div>

Range-based matches can be helpful when the quoted text is excessively long
and encoding the entire string would produce an unwieldy URL.

It is recommended that text snippets shorter than 300 characters always be
encoded using an exact match. Above this limit, the UA should encode the string
as a range-based match.

<div class='note'>
  TODO:  Can we determine the above limit in some less arbitrary way?
</div>

## Use Context Only When Necessary ## {#use-context-only-when-necessary}

Context terms allow the [=text fragment directive=] to disambiguate text
snippets on a page. However, their use can make the URL more brittle in some
cases. Often, the desired string will start or end at an element boundary. The
context will therefore exist in an adjacent element. Changes to the page
structure could invalidate the [=text fragment directive=] since the context and
match text may no longer appear to be adjacent.

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL for the following text:

  <pre>
    &lt;div class="section"&gt;HEADER&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="content"&gt;Text to quote&lt;/div&gt;
  </pre>

  We could craft the [=text fragment directive=] as follows:

  <pre>
    text=HEADER-,Text%20to%20quote
  </pre>

  However, suppose the page changes to add a "[edit]" link beside all section
  headers. This would now break the URL.
</div>

Where a text snippet is long enough and unique, a UA should prefer to avoid
adding superfluous context terms.

It is recommended that context should be used only if one of the following is
true:
<ul>
  <li>The UA determines the quoted text is ambiguous</li>
  <li>The quoted text contains 3 or fewer words</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  TODO: Determine the numeric limit above in less arbitrary way.
</div>

## Determine If Fragment Id Is Needed ## {#determine-if-fragment-id-is-needed}

When the UA navigates to a URL containing a [=text fragment directive=], it will
fallback to scrolling into view a regular element-id based fragment if it
exists and the text fragment isn't found.

This can be useful to provide a fallback, in case the text in the document
changes, invalidating the [=text fragment directive=].

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing quoting the sentence:

  <pre>
    The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus
  </pre>

  By specifying the section that the text appears in, we ensure that, if the
  text is changed or removed, the user will still be pointed to the relevant
  section:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation:~:text=The%20earliest%20known%20tool%20for%20use%20in%20computation%20is%20the%20Sumerian%20abacus">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation:~:text=The%20earliest%20known%20tool%20for%20use%20in%20computation%20is%20the%20Sumerian%20abacus</a>
</div>

However, UAs should take care that the fallback element-id fragment is the
correct one:

<div class='example'>
  Suppose the user navigates to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation. They
  now scroll down to the Symbolic Computations section. There, they select a
  text snippet and choose to create a URL to it:

  <pre>
    By the late 1960s, computer systems could perform symbolic algebraic
    manipulations
  </pre>

  The UA should note that, even though the current URL of the page is:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation, using
  #Early_computation as a fallback is inappropriate. If the above sentence is
  changed or removed, the page will load in the #Early_computation section
  which could be quite confusing to the user.

  If the UA cannot reliably determine an appropriate fragment to fallback to,
  it should remove the fragment id from the URL:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=By%20the%20late%201960s,%20computer%20systems%20could%20perform%20symbolic%20algebraic%20manipulations">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=By%20the%20late%201960s,%20computer%20systems%20could%20perform%20symbolic%20algebraic%20manipulations</a>
</div>

If a UA chooses not to scroll text fragments into view on navigation (reasons
why a UA may make this choice are discussed in [[#security-and-privacy]]), it
must scroll the element-id into view, if provided, regardless of whether a text
fragment was matched. Not doing so would allow detecting the text fragment
match based on whether the element-id was scrolled.
