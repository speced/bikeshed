<section>
  # Introduction # {#introduction}

  This document defines <em>Document Policy</em>, which is a framework for
  designing configurable features as part of the web platform, and for allowing
  web developers to configure those features as part of their site deployment.
</section>

<section>
  # Examples # #{#examples}

  Needs new examples. For now, see explainer.
</section>

<section>
  # Other and related mechanisms # {#other-and-related-mechanisms}

  Document Policy is similar in scope to some existing mechanisms for document
  configuration, though there are significant differences from each.

  <section>
    ## Relation to Permissions Policy ## {#relation-to-permissions-policy}

    Permissions Policy [[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]] is another mechanism which allows
    authors to configure features in documents, and is similar in scope, though
    it use a different inheritance mechanism, which makes it more suitable for
    certain types of features, separate from those which are suitable for
    control by Document Policy.

    Historically, Document Policy was created as a response to a number of
    proposed feature additions to Permissions Policy (named Feature Policy at
    the time), which either didn't quite fit the existing 'feature' model, or
    required significant additional complexity to be added to the Permissions
    Policy spec. This included features with parameters, features with optional
    inheritance into subframes, and features which would inherit differently in
    popups than in other top-level browsing contexts.

    Those features are now proposed to be covered by Document Policy, and
    Permissions Policy is used for features where delegation is the primary
    concern. Permissions Policy features are boolean-valued (either enabled or
    disabled), can never be re-enabled in a child frame if disabled in its
    parent, and generally follow the model of "available in top-level browsing
    contexts and their same-origin children; must be delegated to cross-origin
    frames."

    In contrast, features controlled by Document Policy may take parameters, and
    those parameters may have unrelated values in different frames (constraining
    a feature in a parent frame does not necessarily constrain its child
    frames.)
  </section>

  <section>
    ## Relation to Content Security Policy ## {#relation-to-csp}

    Content-Security-Policy [[CSP]] also configures 'features' in documents,
    although it is primarily concerned with the origin of resources in a page,
    rather than controlling what those resources can do once loaded.

    CSP also provides a different mechanism for setting sandbox flags on a
    document, through the <em>sandbox</em> directive. If sandbox flags are moved
    to document policy, then this may be redundant, as the two headers may
    encode identical information.

    CSP-Embedded-Enforcement introduced a model for forcing a policy to be
    adhered to by child documents, and for rejecting non-conforming documents as
    network errors during Fetch. This model is adopted by document policy for
    the required policy mechanism.
  </section>

  <section>
    ## Relation to Sandboxing ## {#relation-to-sandboxing}

    Iframe sandboxing is another mechanism for controlling features in
    documents, and behaves in a very similar manner to document policy's
    required policies: disabling a feature is something that can be imposed on
    a frame, and affects all content loaded into that frame.

    The features which are controlled by the iframe sandbox attribute could be
    expressed very naturally with document policy.

    One key difference between iframe sandboxing and document policy is that all
    sandbox features are applied by default when the 'sandbox' attribute is used
    on a frame, and must be re-enabled one-by-one. This makes it very difficult
    to extend the sandboxing model with new features, as any additions will
    immediately affect all existing sandboxed content. Additionally, there is no
    mechanism for the origin server to know that its content will be sandboxed,
    so it is difficult to add new sandbox features which could potentially alter
    control flow in a sandboxed document, as this could introduce new security
    vulnerabilities in existing content.

  <section>
    ## Configuration Points ## {#configuration-points}

    A <dfn export>configuration point</dfn> is a Web Platform API or behavior
    which can be enabled, diabled, or configured through Document Policy.
    Configuration points should be defined in the specification which describes
    the underlying API or behavior, although there is a registry of defined
    configuration points in use attached to this document.

    A <a>configuration point</a> has a <dfn
    for="configuration point">name</dfn>, which is a token.

    A <a>configuration point</a> has a <dfn
    for="configuration point">type</dfn>, which is one of:
    * `boolean`,
    * `integer`,
    * `float`, or
    * `enum`.

    A <a>configuration point</a> has a <dfn
    for="configuration point">range</dfn>, which is a subset of all values for
    its <a for="configuration point">type</a>.

    A <a>configuration point</a> has a <dfn
    for="configuration point">default value</dfn>, which is an element of its
    <a for="configuration point">range</a>.

    <div class="issue">Should configuration points be allowed to have multiple
    parameters? Perhaps parameters should be defined separately, with names,
    types, and ranges.</div>

    <div class="informative">
    When introducing a new configuration point, the <a
    for="configuration point">default value</a> should be chosen carefully, with
    highest consideration given to web compatibility. When no explicit policy
    has been declared for a document, the default value will be in effect.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    ## Policies ## {#policies}

    A <dfn>document policy</dfn> is an ordered map from <a>configuration
    points</a> to <a>policy configurations</a>

    A <dfn>policy configuration</dfn> is a tuple consisting of a <dfn
    for="policy configuration">value</dfn>, which is an element of the
    <a>configuration point</a>'s <a for="configuration point">range</a>, and a
    <dfn for="policy configuration">reporting endpoint</dfn>, which is a string,
    and which may be null.

    A <a>browsing context</a> has a <dfn>required document policy</dfn>, which
    is a <a>document policy</a>. A <a>browsing context</a> with a null <a>opener
    browsing context</a> has an empty <a>required document policy</a>.

    A <a>Document</a> has a <dfn>nested context required document policy</dfn>,
    which is a <a>document policy</a>.

    A <a>Document</a> has a <dfn for="Document">document policy</dfn>, which is a
    <a for="/">document policy</a>.

    A <a>Document</a> has a <dfn>report-only document policy</dfn>, which is a
    <a>document policy</a>.

  #  Required Policy Serialization # {#serialization}

  <section>
    * Explain here how required policies are <dfn
      data-lt="serialized document policy">serialized</dfn> as structured
      headers.
    * Ensure that there is a canonical form (for compat testing).
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  # Reporting # {#reporting}

  A site deploying a document policy may want to know if any of the policies
  which are set on its pages are violated. For instance, a site which sets a
  policy requiring all images to be match the size of their containers may want
  to be alerted if a new developer or CMS inserts oversized images into content.
  Similarly, a site which deploys a policy which restricts the use of the
  `document.write` API may want to receive reports if a script is ever imported
  which uses it.

  This section defines a mechanism for reporting such violations using the
  Reporting API. [[!REPORTING]]

  A site may also want to test out a policy in real-world situations before
  enforcing it. This section also defines a "Report-only" mode, where the user
  agent can watch for situations which would be policy violations and report on
  them, without enforcing the policy. This allows site owners to work to drive
  the real-world violation count down to an acceptable level before actually
  deploying the policy.

  Reporting is only possible from the page which configures the policy. It is
  not possible to receive reports from a nested page which violates a required
  policy.

  "Violation" is defined per-feature, but should always reflect an action of the
  web developer, rather than the user directly.

  This implies that not all policies can be reported on. There is a class of
  feature whose settings cannot be said to be "violated" in any meaningful way
  by markup, or by script actions. A hypothetical feature which disabled text
  entry in form fields, for instance, could be enforced by the user agent, but
  if a user were to try to type in those fields, causing enforcement to be
  required, that would not represent a violation of the policy, and should not
  be reported.

  <section>
    ## Configuring in-document reporting ## {#configure-reporting}

    ### The "report-to" parameter ### {#report-to-parameter}

    Any directive can include a parameter named `report-to`, which names a
    reporting <a>endpoint</a> to which violation reports for that feature will
    be sent.

    Example:
    ```
    Document-Policy: something=1.0;report-to=endpoint1, something-else=?0;report-to=endpoint2
    ```

    ### Setting the default reporting endpoint ### {#reporting-default}

    If violations for many or all features should be sent to the same endpoint,
    then it may be easier to define a single default <a>endpoint</a>. This can
    be defined by a parameter on the special token `*`. If a default
    <a>endpoint</a> is provided, then unless otherwise specified, all violation
    reports will be sent to that named endpoint. If a feature also specifies its
    own endpoint, with the `report-to` parameter, then reports will go to that
    endpoint instead. (Reports are not sent to both endpoints.)

    Example:
    ```
    Document-Policy: something=1.0, something-else=?0, *;report-to=endpoint
    ```

    ### Disabling reporting for a feature ### {#reporting-disable}

    If a default endpoint has been specified, then it may be necessary to
    disable reporting for specific features. This can be done by specifying the
    special endpoint name `none` as the value for the `report-to` parameter.
    This will override the default endpoint and disable reporting for that
    feature.

    Example:
    ```
    Document-Policy: something=1.0;report-to=none, something-else=?0,
                     *;report-to=endpoiont
    ```

  </section>

  <section>
    ## Report-only mode ## {#report-only}

    A document policy can be a "report-only" policy. Report-only policies are
    specified with a `Document-Policy-Report-Only` header. Violations of a
    report-only policy will cause a report to be generated, as the enforcing
    policy would, but they do not cause any other action to be taken by the user
    agent.


    Document-Policy-Report-Only

    The `report-to` directive parameter should be used with directives in this
    header, or else they will have no effect at all.

    Example:
    ```
    Document-Policy-Report-Only: something=1.0;report-to=endpoint,
                                 something-else=?0;report-to=endpoint2
    ```
  </section>

</section>

  # Delivery # {#delivery}
  <section>
    ## Policies as Structured Headers ## {#policies-as-structured-headers}

    Policies are represented in HTTP headers and in HTML attributes as the
    serialization of an sh-dictionary structure. Each dictionary member is a
    <a>document policy directive</a>.

    A <dfn export>document policy directive</dfn> is an element of a
    <a>serialized document policy</a>, and consists of a <a
    for="document policy directive">directive name</a>, which is an sh-token,
    and associated <a
    href="#document-policy-directive-parameters">parameters</a>.

    A <dfn for="document policy directive">directive name</dfn> may be one of:

    * The <a for="configuration point">name</a> of a <a>configuration point</a>
    * The Token "`*`".

    A <dfn>policy value</dfn> is an element of the <a for="configuration
    point">range</a> for the named <a>configuration point</a>.
  </section>

    ### Parameters ### {#document-policy-directive-parameters}

    Any <a>document policy directive</a> may include a parameter named
    `report-to`, whose value must be a string.

    A <a>document policy directive</a> whose <a for="document policy
    directive">directive name</a> names a <a>configuration point</a> with
    <a>type</a> `boolean` has no required parameters.

    A <a>document policy directive</a> whose <a for="document policy
    directive">directive name</a> names a <a>configuration point</a> with
    <a>type</a> `integer` has a required parameter, whose value must be an
    integer in the <a>configuration point</a>'s <a for="configuration
    point">range</a>.

    A <a>document policy directive</a> whose <a for="document policy
    directive">directive name</a> names a <a>Configuration point</a> with
    <a>type</a> `float` has a required parameter, whose value must be a decimal
    in the <a>configuration point</a>'s <a for="configuration point">range</a>.

    A <a>document policy directive</a> whose <a for="document policy
    directive">directive name</a> names a <a>configuration point</a> with
    <a>type</a> `enum` has a required parameter, whose value must be 'true',
    and whose name must be a token in the <a>configuration point</a>'s <a
    for="configuration point">range</a>.

    Examples:
        * `boolean-feature`
        * `boolean-feature=?0`
        * `integer-feature=2`
        * `float-feature=-0.2`
        * `enum-feature=state`

  </section>
  <section>
    ## HTTP Headers ## {#http-headers}
  <section>
    ### Document-Policy ### {#document-policy-http-header}

    The &#96;<dfn export http-header
    id="document-policy-header"><code>Document-Policy</code></dfn>&#96; HTTP
    header can be used in the [=response=] (server to client) to communicate the
    <a>document policy</a> that should be enforced by the client.

    The <code>Document-Policy</code> header is a Structured Header. Its value
    must be a dictionary. Its ABNF is:

    Document-Policy = sh-dictionary

    If any dictionary member name does not name a supported configuration point
    or the special value "*", then the dictionary memver will be ignored by the
    processing steps.
  </section>
  <section>
    ### Document-Policy-Report-Only ### {#document-policy-report-only-http-header}

    The &#96;<dfn export http-header
    id="document-policy-report-only-header"><code>Document-Policy-Report-Only</code></dfn>&#96;
    HTTP header can be used in the [=response=] (server to client) to configure
    the <a>report-only document policy</a> for the document.

    The <code>Document-Policy-Report-Only</code> header is a Structured Header.
    Its value must be a dictionary. It has exactly the same syntax as the
    `Document-Policy` header.
  </section>
  <section>
    ### Require-Document-Policy ### {#require-document-policy-http-header}

    The &#96;<dfn export http-header
    id="require-document-policy-header">`Require-Document-Policy`</dfn>&#96;
    HTTP header field is a response header which is used to communicate to the
    client the minimum <a>required document policy</a> to apply to all nested
    content.

    The `Require-Document-Policy` header is a Structured Header dictionary, with
    exactly the same syntax as the `Document-Policy` header.
  </section>
  <section>
    ### Sec-Required-Document-Policy ### {#sec-required-document-policy-http-header}

    The &#96;<dfn export http-header
    id="sec-required-document-policy-header">`Sec-Required-Document-Policy`</dfn>&#96;
    HTTP header field is a request header which is used to communicate to the
    server the <a>document policy</a> which must be sent with the document
    returned with the request.

    The header's value is the <a href="#serialization"></a> of one or more
    <a>document policy directive</a>s
  </section>
</section>
  <section>
    ## The `policy` attribute of the `iframe` element ## {#iframe-policy-attribute}

    <{iframe}> elements have a "`policy`" attribute, which contains a required
    policy directive (SH format).
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  # Integrations # {#integrations}

  If a frame has a required policy, then that policy must be advertised in the
  request header for any outgoing document requests, to inform the server of the
  policy which will be applied to the document by the user agent. This allows
  the server to alter the representation which is returned, to conform to that
  policy.

  In the case where a required policy request header is present, the response
  must contain a compatible document policy header, or the fetch will fail.

  <section>
    ## Integration with HTML ## {#integration-with-html}

    The following changes should be incorporated into [[HTML]]:

    * <{iframe}> elements should have the following IDL added:
```
        [CEReactions] attribute DOMString policy;
```
    * The iframe policy attribute should be defined as follows:

      * The `policy` attribute, when specified, adds a <a>required document
        policy</a> to the `iframe`'s <a>nested browsing context</a>, when it is
        initialized. Its value must be a <a>serialized document policy</a>.

    * In [[HTML#the-document-object]], add the following lines:
      * The <a>Document</a> has a <b>document policy</b>, which is a <a>document
        policy</a>, which is initially empty.

      * The <a>Document</a> has a <b>nested context required document
        policy</b>, which is a <a>document policy</a>, which is initially
        empty.

    * In the <a>creating a new browsing context</a> algorithm:
      * Add the following step after step 5:

        6. Set <var ignore>browsingContext</var>'s <a>required document
          policy</a> to the result of <a
          data-lt="create-for-browsingcontext">creating a required policy for a
          browsing context</a> <var ignore>browsingContext</var>.

      * Change step 9 (renumbered now to 10) to read:
        10. Let <var ignore>document</var> be a new <a>Document</a>, marked as
          an <a>HTML document</a> in <a>quirks mode</a>, whose <a>content
          type</a> is `"text/html"`, <a>origin</a> is <var ignore>origin</var>,
          <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> is <var ignore>sandboxFlags</var>,
          <a>permissions policy</a> is <var ignore>permissions policy</var>,
          document policy is identical to <var ignore>browsingContext</var>'s
          <a>required document policy</a>, and which is both ready for
          post-load tasks and completely loaded immediately.

    * In the [=process a navigate fetch=] algorithm:
      * Add the following step after step 5:

        6. Set <var ignore>request</var>'s <a>required document policy</a> to
          <var ignore>browsingContext</var>'s <a>required document policy</a>.

    * In the <a>initialise the document object</a> algorithm:
      * Add the following steps after step 3:
        4. Let <var ignore>documentPolicy</var> be the result of <a
          data-lt="create-document-policy">creating a document policy</a> for
          <var ignore>browsingContext</var> from <var ignore>response</var>.

        5. Let <var ignore>nestedContextRequiredDocumentPolicy</var> be the
          result of <a
          data-lt="create-nested-context-required-document-policy">creating a
          nested context document policy</a> for
          <var ignore>browsingContext</var> from <var ignore>response</var>.

      * Change step 6 (renumbered now to 8) to read:
        7. Let <var ignore>document</var> be a new Document, whose type is <var
          ignore>type</var>, content type is <var ignore>contentType</var>,
          origin is <var ignore>origin</var>, permissions policy is <var
          ignore>permissionsPolicy</var>, active sandboxing flag set is <var
          ignore>finalSandboxFlags</var>, document policy is <var
          ignore>documentPolicy</var>, and nested context required document
          policy is <var ignore>nestedContextRequiredDocumentPolicy</var>.
  </section>

  <section>
    ## Integration with Fetch ## {#integration-with-fetch}

    The following changes should be incorporated into [[FETCH]]:

    * In [[FETCH#requests]], add the following:

      * A [=Request/request=] has an associated <dfn
        data-lt="request-required-document-policy">required document
        policy</dfn>, which is a <a>document policy</a>. Unless otherwise
        stated, it is null.

    * In [[FETCH#http-network-or-cache-fetch]], after step 15, insert the
      following:

      1. If |httpRequest| has a <a
        data-lt="request-required-document-policy">required document policy</a>,
        then
         1. Let |serializedRequiredPolicy| be the result of calling <a>Serialize
           Required Policy</a> on |httpRequest|'s <a
           data-lt="request-required-document-policy">required document
           policy</a>.
         2. Append `Sec-Required-Document-Policy`/|serializedRequiredPolicy| to
           |httpRequest|'s [=request/header list=].

    * In [[FETCH#main-fetch]], add the following algorithm to the list of
      algorithms in step 11:

        * <a data-lt="should response to request be blocked due to document policy">should
          <var ignore>internalResponse</var> to <var ignore>request</var> be
          blocked due to document policy</a>

  # Privacy and Security # {#privacy-and-security}

  This specification standardizes a mechanism for an embedding page to set a
  policy which will be enforced on an embedded page. Explicit acknowledgment of
  a required policy is required, however, unlike existing the existing iframe
  <{iframe/sandbox}>, mechanism. This means that behaviors of existing features
  cannot be changed in published web sites, without the cooperation of those
  sites.

  There are some privacy and security considerations to keep in mind with this
  model:

  * Exposure of behavior in a cross-origin subframe to its embedder.
  * Exposure of embedder state to the embedded document thorough policy.
  * Unanticipated behavior change by blindly accepting a required policy.

  To a degree, these concerns are already present in the web platform, and this
  specification attempts to at least not make them needlessly worse.

  Security and privacy issues may also be caused by the design of individual
  configuration points, so care must be taken when integrating with this
  specification. This section attempts to provide some guidance as to what kinds
  of behaviors could cause such issues.

  ## Exposure of cross-origin behavior ## {#exposure-of-cross-origin-behavior}

  Configuraton points should be designed such that a violation of the policy in
  a framed document is not observable by documents in other frames. For
  instance, a hypothetical feature which caused a event to be fired in the
  embedding document if it is used while disabled by policy, could be used to
  extract information about the state of an embedded document. If the feature is
  known only to be used while a user is logged in to the site, for instance,
  then the embedder could disable that feature for the frame, and then listen
  for the resulting events to determine whether or not the user is logged in.

  Additionally, care must be taken so that information about the contents of
  cross-origin resources (which is not normally available to a document) is not
  made visible by a policy. Image contents, for instance, may contain private
  information, and a fine-grained policy may allow an attacker to infer
  something about the contents of the image by carefully tuning the policy's
  configuration parameter. Policies which act on the contents of subresources
  should either exclude non-readable resources, or take steps to limit the
  amount of information which can be inferred about the resource.

  ## Advertisement of required policy ## {#advertisement-of-required-policy}

  As a mitigation to the behavior change problem discussed above, requests for
  embedded content in a frame with a required policy will be sent with an HTTP
  header detailing the policy requirements. This header is visible to origin
  servers, and its contents may reveal details about the embedder page.
  Embedders should be aware of this when choosing to require a policy on their
  embedded content.

  ## Blind acceptance of required policy ## {#blind-acceptance-of-policy}

  Since adhering to the embedder-required policy is necessary in order to be
  loaded, site owners may be tempted to configure web servers to simply echo the
  `Sec-Required-Document-Policy` request header in the response's
  `Document-Policy` header. While this will ensure that the document's policy is
  always compatible with the request, it may open up the embedded document to
  the risk that the embedder can alter control flow within it, by disabling or
  changing the behavior of existing APIs. This is especially true as new
  configuration points are added to the document policy model after the content
  is written. It is difficult to future-proof a document against all possible
  new behavior changes.

  Sites which expect to be embedded in a context with a required document policy
  can mitigate this by setting their policy to the actual strictest policy that
  they know they can support, or by echoing the incoming policy for only the
  configuration points which they are aware of, and understand the potential
  scope of behavior changes.
