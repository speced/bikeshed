  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    Unstable, Inc. wants to understand better how often its website is crashing
    in the wild. It can do this by delivering the following header to define a
    default reporting endpoint, which will direct crash reports there:

    <pre>
      Reporting-Endpoints: default="https://example.com/reports"
    </pre>

  <dfn>Crash reports</dfn> indicate that the user was unable to continue using
  the page because the browser (or one of its processes necessary for the page)
  crashed. For security reasons, no details of the crash are communicated except
  for a unique identifier (which can be interpreted by the browser vendor), and
  optionally the reason for the crash (such as "oom").

  <a>Crash reports</a> are a type of [=report=].

  <a>Crash reports</a> have the <a>report type</a> "crash".

  <pre class="idl exclude">
    [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
    interface CrashReportBody : ReportBody {
      [Default] object toJSON();
      readonly attribute DOMString? reason;
    };
  </pre>

  A <a>crash report</a>'s [=report/body=], represented in JavaScript by
  {{CrashReportBody}}, contains the following field:

    - <dfn for="CrashReportBody">reason</dfn>: A more specific classification of
      the type of crash that occured, if known, or omitted otherwise. The
      valid <a>reason</a> strings are shown below.

  <table border=1 cellpadding=5px style="border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th><a>Reason</a></th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>oom</td>
        <td>The page ran out of memory.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>unresponsive</td>
        <td>The page was killed due to being unresponsive.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  Note: Crash reports are always delivered to the <a>endpoint</a> named
  <code>default</code>; there is currently no way to override this.  If you want
  to receive other kinds of reports, but not crash reports, make sure to use a
  different name for the endpoint that you choose for those reports.

  Note: Crash reports are not observable to JavaScript, as the page which would
  receive them is, by definition, not able to. The IDL description of
  CrashReportBody exists in this spec to provide a JSON-seriaizable interface
  whose serialization can be embedded in the out-of-band reports.

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

  [[!REPORTING]], which defines the framework on which this specification
  depends, provides at most a best-efforts delivery mechanism. This is
  especially true when it comes to reporting crashes. There are probably always
  going to be certain crash conditions which simply cannot be reported on (for
  instance, if the crash occurs within the crash-monitoring code of the user
  agent, or if the computer hosting the user agent were to suddenly cease to
  exist). However, many crashes *can* be observed by modern browsers, and their
  immediate causes can be deduced.

  A user agent implementing crash reports SHOULD attempt to monitor documents
  for crashes in a way that will continue to function even when the process
  which is responsible for that document crashes, or is terminated by the
  operating system.

  There are multiple ways to implement such a monitor, with varying levels of
  reliability and robustness to specific crash causes, and this specification
  does not attempt to prescribe any particular such method.
