<h2 id="close-signals">Close signals</h2>

(This section could be introduced as a new subsection of [[!HTML]]'s <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#editing">User interaction</a> section.)

In an [=implementation-defined=] (and likely device-specific) manner, a user can send a <dfn export>close signal</dfn> to the user agent. This indicates that the user wishes to close something which is currently being shown on the screen, such as a popup, menu, dialog, picker, or display mode.

<div class="example" id="example-close-signals">
  Some example close signals are:

  * The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key on desktop platforms
  * The back button on Android
  * The two-finger scrub "z" gesture on iOS when using VoiceOver (or, more generally, any assistive technology dismiss gesture)
  * The square button on a DualShock (PlayStation) controller
</div>

Whenever the user agent receives a potential close signal targeted at a {{Document}} |document|, it must perform the following <dfn export>close signal steps</dfn>:

1. If |document|'s [=fullscreen element=] is non-null, then <a spec="FULLSCREEN">fully exit fullscreen</a> and return.
   <p class="note">This does <em>not</em> fire any relevant event, such as {{keydown}}; it only fires {{Document/fullscreenchange}}.
1. Fire any relevant event, per <cite>UI Events</cite> or other relevant specifications. [[!UI-EVENTS]]
   <p class="note">As an example of a relevant event that is outside of the model given in <cite>UI Events</cite>, current thinking is that assistive technology would <a href="https://github.com/WICG/aom/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md#user-action-events-from-assistive-technology">synthesize</a> an <kbd>Esc</kbd> {{keydown}} and {{keyup}} event sequence when the user sends a [=close signal=] by using a dimiss gesture.</p>
   If multiple such events are fired, the user agent must pick one for the purposes of the following steps.
   <p class="note">For example, it is typical on desktop platforms for pressing <em>down</em> on the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to be a [=close signal=]. So, if assistive technology is synthesizing both {{keydown}} and {{keyup}} events, then it would likely pick the {{keydown}} event for the next steps, to better match behavior of desktop platforms without assistive technology in play.</p>
1. If such an event was fired, and its [=Event/canceled flag=] is set, then return.
1. If such an event was fired, then perform the following steps within the same task as that event was fired in, immediately after firing the event. Otherwise, [=queue a global task=] on the [=user interaction task source=] given |document|'s [=relevant global object=] to perform the following steps.
1. If |document| is not [=Document/fully active=], then return.
1. Let |closedSomething| be the result of [=signaling close watchers=] on |document|'s [=relevant global object=].
1. If |closedSomething| was true, then return.
1. Otherwise, there was nothing watching for a close signal. The user agent may instead interpret this interaction as some other action, instead of as a close signal.

<p class="example" id="example-desktop-esc-sequence">On a desktop platform where <kbd>Esc</kbd> is the close signal, the user agent will first fire an appropriately-initialized {{keydown}} event. If the web developer intercepts this event and calls {{Event/preventDefault()}}, then nothing further happens. But if the event is fired without being canceled, then the user agent proceeds to [=signal close watchers=].

<p class="example" id="example-android-back-sequence">On Android where the back button is a potential close signal, no event is involved, so when the user agent determines that the back button represents a close signal, it [=queues a task=] to [=signal close watchers=]. If there is a [=close watcher=] on the [=close watcher stack=], then that will get triggered; otherwise, the user agent will interpret the back button press as a request to <a spec="HTML">traverse the history by a delta</a> of &minus;1.

<h3 id="close-watchers">Close watcher infrastructure</h3>

Each {{Window}} has a <dfn export>close watcher stack</dfn>, a [=list=] of [=close watchers=], initially empty.

<p class="note">It isn't quite a proper [=stack=], as [=list/items=] can get [=list/removed=] from the middle of it if a [=close watcher=] is [=close watcher/destroyed=] or [=close watcher/closed=] via web developer code. User-initiated [=close signals=] always act on the top of the [=close watcher stack=], however.

Each {{Window}} has a <dfn export>timestamp of last activation used for close watchers</dfn>. This is either a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} value, positive infinity, or negative infinity (i.e. the same value space as the <a spec="HTML">last activation timestamp</a>). It is initially positive infinity.

<p class="note">This value is used to ensure that a given user activation only enables a single {{CloseWatcher}} {{CloseWatcher/cancel}} or <{dialog}> {{HTMLElement/cancel}} event to be fired, per user activation. This is different than requiring [=transient activation=] to fire the event, because we want to allow the event to happen arbitrarily long after the user activation.

A <dfn export>close watcher</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following [=struct/items=]:

* A <dfn for="close watcher">window</dfn>, a {{Window}}.
* A <dfn for="close watcher">cancel action</dfn>, a list of steps. These steps can never throw an exception, and return either true (to indicate the caller will proceed to the [=close watcher/close action=]) or false (to indicate the caller will bail out).
* A <dfn for="close watcher">close action</dfn>, a list of steps. These steps can never throw an exception.
* An <dfn for="close watcher">was created with user activation</dfn> boolean.
* An <dfn for="close watcher">is grouped with previous</dfn> boolean.
* An <dfn for="close watcher">is running cancel action</dfn> boolean, initially false.

<p class="note">The [=close watcher/is grouped with previous=] boolean is set if a [=close watcher=] is created without [=transient activation=]. (Except the very first [=close watcher=] in the [=close watcher stack=] that is created without transient activation, which gets a pass on this restriction.) It causes a user-triggered [=close signal=] to close all such grouped-together [=close watchers=], thus ensuring that web developers can't make [=close signals=] ineffective by creating an excessive number of [=close watchers=] which all intercept the signal.

<h2 id="patches">Updates to other specifications</h2>

<h3 id="patch-fullscreen">Fullscreen</h3>

Replace the sentence about "If the end user instructs..." in [[FULLSCREEN#ui]] with the following:

If the user initiates a [=close signal=], this will trigger the <a spec="FULLSCREEN">fully exit fullscreen</a> algorithm as part of the [=close signal steps=]. This takes precedence over any [=close watchers=].

<h3 id="patch-dialog">The <{dialog}> element</h3>

Update <cite>HTML</cite>'s <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-dialog-element">The `dialog` element</a> section as follows: [[!HTML]]

Each <{dialog}> element has a <dfn for="HTMLDialogElement">close watcher</dfn>, which is a [=close watcher=] or null, initially null.

<div algorithm="showModal patch">
  In the {{HTMLDialogElement/showModal()}} steps, after adding |subject| to the [=top layer=], append the following step:

  1. Set |subject|'s [=HTMLDialogElement/close watcher=] to the result of [=creating a close watcher=] given |subject|'s [=relevant global object=], with:
    * <i>[=create a close watcher/cancelAction=]</i> being to return the result of [=firing an event=] named {{HTMLElement/cancel}} at |subject|, with the {{Event/cancelable}} attribute initialized to true.
    * <i>[=create a close watcher/closeAction=]</i> being to <a spec="HTML" lt="close">Close the dialog</a> |subject| with no return value.

  <p class="note">The resultant [=close watcher=] might be [=close watcher/is grouped with previous|grouped=] with others on the stack, so that it responds alongside them to a single [=close signal=]. For example, opening multiple modal dialogs from a single user activation can cause this. The {{HTMLDialogElement/showModal()}} method proceeds without any exception or other indication of this, although the browser could [=report a warning to the console=].
</div>

Remove the "Canceling dialogs" section entirely. It is now handled entirely by the infrastructure in [[#close-signals]] and the creation of a [=close watcher=].

Modify the <a spec="HTML" lt="close">close the dialog</a> steps to [=close watcher/destroy=] the <{dialog}>'s [=HTMLDialogElement/close watcher=] and set it to null, if it is not already null.

Similarly, modify the "If at any time a <{dialog}> element is remo  ved from a Document" steps to do the same.

<h2 id="security-and-privacy">Security and privacy considerations</h2>

<h3 id="security">Security considerations</h3>

The main security consideration with this API is preventing abusive pages from hijacking the fallback behavior in the last part of the [=close signal steps=]. A concrete example is on Android, where the [=close signal=] is the software back button, and this fallback behavior is to <a spec="HTML">traverse the history by a delta</a> of &minus;1. If developers could always intercept Android back button presses via {{CloseWatcher}} instances and <{dialog}> elements, then they could effectively break the back button by never letting it pass through to the fallback behavior.

Much of the complexity of this specification is designed around preventing such abuse. Without it, the API could consist of a single event. (Although that would make it ergonomically difficult for developers to coordinate on which component of their application should handle the [=close signal=].) But with this constraint, we need an API surface such as the {{CloseWatcher/CloseWatcher()}} constructor which can note whether [=transient activation=] was present at construction time, as well as the [=close watcher stack=] to ensure that we remove at least one [=close watcher=] per [=close signal=].

Concretely, the mechanism of [=creating a close watcher=] ensures that web developers can only create {{CloseWatcher}} instances, or call {{Event/preventDefault()}} on {{CloseWatcher/cancel}} events, by attempting to [=transient activation-consuming API|consume user activation=]. If a {{CloseWatcher}} instance is created without [=transient activation=], then after one "free" [=close watcher=], any such close watcher is [=close watcher/is grouped with previous|grouped=] together with the currently-top close watcher in the [=close watcher stack|stack=], so that both of them are closed by a single [=close signal=]. This gives similar protections to what browsers have in place today, where back button UI skips entries that were added without user activation. Similarly, if there hasn't been any [=transient activation=], the {{CloseWatcher/cancel}} event is not fired.

We do allow one "free" ungrouped {{CloseWatcher}} to be created, even without [=transient activation=], to handle cases like session inactivity timeout dialogs, or urgent notifications of server-triggered events. The end result is that this specification expands the number of Android back button presses that a maximally-abusive page could require to escape from <var>number of user activations</var> + 1 to <var>number of user activations</var> + 2. (See <a href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher#abuse-analysis">the explainer</a> for a full analysis.) We believe this tradeoff is worthwhile.

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy considerations</h3>

We believe the privacy impact of this API is minimal. The only information it gives about the user to the web developer is that a close signal has occurred, which is a very infrequent and coarse piece of user input.

In all cases we're aware of today, such close signals are already detectable by web developers (e.g., by using {{keydown!!event}} listeners on desktop or {{Window/popstate}} listeners on Android). In theory, by correlating these existing events with the {{CloseWatcher}}'s {{CloseWatcher/close}} event, a web developer could determine some information about the platform. (I.e., if they correlate with {{keydown!!event}} events, the user is likely on desktop, or at least on a keyboard-attached mobile device.) This is similar to existing techniques which detect whether touch events or mouse events are fired, and user agents which want to emulate a different platform in order to mask the user's choice might want to apply similar mitigation techniques for close watchers as they do for other platform-revealing events.
