Abstract: The Digital Goods API allows web applications to get information about their digital products and their user's purchases managed by a digital store. The user agent abstracts connections to the store and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/">Payment Request API</a> is used to make purchases.

# Usage Examples # {#usage-examples}

Note: This section is non-normative.

## Getting a service instance ## {#getting-a-service-instance}

<div class="example" id="Getting a service instance">
  Usage of the API begins with a call to
  {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()|window.getDigitalGoodsService()}}, which
  might only be available in certain contexts (eg. HTTPS, app, browser, OS). If
  available, the method can be called with a service provider URL. The method
  returns a promise that is rejected if the given service provider is not
  available.

  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    if (window.getDigitalGoodsService === undefined) {
      // Digital Goods API is not supported in this context.
      return;
    }
    try {
      const digitalGoodsService = await
          window.getDigitalGoodsService("https://example.com/billing");
      // Use the service here.
      ...
    } catch (error) {
      // Our preferred service provider is not available.
      // Use a normal web-based payment flow.
      console.error("Failed to get service:", error.message);
      return;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Querying item details ## {#querying-item-details}

<div class="example" id="Querying item details">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    const details = await digitalGoodsService
        .getDetails(['shiny_sword', 'gem', 'monthly_subscription']);
    for (item of details) {
      const priceStr = new Intl.NumberFormat(
          locale,
          {style: 'currency', currency: item.price.currency}
        ).format(item.price.value);
      AddShopMenuItem(item.itemId, item.title, priceStr, item.description);
    }
  </xmp>

  The {{DigitalGoodsService/getDetails()}} method returns server-side details
  about a given set of items, intended to be displayed to the user in a menu, so
  that they can see the available purchase options and prices without having to
  go through a purchase flow.

  The returned {{ItemDetails}} sequence can be in any order and might not
  include an item if it doesn't exist on the server (i.e. there is not a 1:1
  correspondence between the input list and output).

  The item ID is a string representing the primary key of the items, configured
  in the store server. There is no function to get a list of item IDs; those
  have to be hard-coded in the client code or fetched from the developer’s own
  server.

  The item’s price is a {{PaymentCurrencyAmount}} containing the current price
  of the item in the user’s current region and currency. It is designed to be
  formatted for the user’s current locale using
  [[ECMA-402#sec-intl.numberformat|Intl.NumberFormat]], as shown above.

  For more information on the fields in the {{ItemDetails}} object, refer to the
  [ItemDetails dictionary] section below.
</div>

## Purchase using Payment Request API ## {#purchase-using-payment-request-api}

<div class="example" id="Purchase using Payment Request API">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    const details = await digitalGoodsService.getDetails(['monthly_subscription']);
    const item = details[0];
    new PaymentRequest(
      [{supportedMethods: 'https://example.com/billing',
        data: {itemId: item.itemId}}]);
  </xmp>

  The purchase flow itself uses the [[payment-request|Payment Request API]]. We
  don’t show the
  full payment request code here, but note that the item ID for any items the
  user chooses to purchase can be sent in the <code>data</code> field of a
  <code>methodData</code> entry
  for the given payment method, in a manner specific to the store.
</div>

## Checking existing purchases ## {#checking-existing-purchases}

<div class="example" id="Checking existing purchases">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    purchases = await digitalGoodsService.listPurchases();
    for (p of purchases) {
      VerifyOnBackendAndGrantEntitlement(p.itemId, p.purchaseToken);
    }
  </xmp>

  The {{DigitalGoodsService/listPurchases()}} method allows a client to get a
  list of items that are
  currently owned or purchased by the user. This might be necessary to check for
  entitlements (e.g. whether a subscription, promotional code, or permanent
  upgrade is active) or to recover from network interruptions during a purchase
  (e.g. item is purchased but not yet confirmed with a backend). The method
  returns item IDs and purchase tokens, which would typically be verified using
  a direct developer-to-provider API before granting entitlements.
</div>

## Checking past purchases ## {#checking-past-purchases}

<div class="example" id="Checking purchases">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    const purchaseHistory = await digitalGoodsService.listPurchaseHistory();
    for (p of purchaseHistory) {
      DisplayPreviousPurchase(p.itemId);
    }
  </xmp>

  The {{DigitalGoodsService/listPurchaseHistory()}} method allows a client
  to list the latest purchases for each item type ever purchased by the
  user. Can include expired or consumed purchases. Some stores might not keep
  such history, in which case it would return the same data as the
  {{DigitalGoodsService/listPurchases()}} method.
</div>

## Consuming a purchase ## {#consuming-a-purchase}

<div class="example" id="Consuming a purchase">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    digitalGoodsService.consume(purchaseToken);
  </xmp>

  Purchases that are designed to be purchased multiple times usually need to be
  marked as "consumed" before they can be purchased again by the user. An
  example of a consumable purchase is an in-game powerup that makes the player
  stronger for a short period of time. This can be done with the
  {{DigitalGoodsService/consume()}} method.

  It is preferable to use a direct developer-to-provider API to consume
  purchases, if one is available, in order to more verifiably ensure that a
  purchase was used up.
</div>

## Use with subdomain iframes ## {#use-with-subdomain-iframes}

<div class="example" id="Use with subdomain iframes">
  <xmp highlight="javascript">
    <iframe
      src="https://sub.origin.example"
      allow="payment">
    </iframe>
  </xmp>

  To indicate that a subdomain iframe is allowed to invoke the Digital Goods
  API, the <code>allow</code> attribute along with the <code>"payment"</code>
  keyword can be specified on the iframe element. Cross-origin iframes cannot
  invoke the Digital Goods API. The
  [[permissions-policy|Permissions Policy]] specification provides further
  details and examples.
</div>

# API definition # {#api-definition}

## Extensions to the Window interface ## {#extensions-to-the-window-interface}

<xmp class="idl">
  partial interface Window {
    [SecureContext] Promise<DigitalGoodsService> getDigitalGoodsService(
        DOMString serviceProvider);
  };
</xmp>

The {{Window}} object MAY expose a {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()}} method.
User agents that do not support Digital Goods SHOULD NOT expose
{{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()}} on the {{Window}} interface.

Note: The above statement is designed to permit feature detection. If
{{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()}} is present, there is a reasonable
expectation that it will work with at least one service provider.

### getDigitalGoodsService() method ### {#getdigitalgoodsservice-method}

Note: The {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()}} method is called to determine
whether the given
{{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}} is supported
in the current context. The method returns a Promise that will be resolved with
a {{DigitalGoodsService}} object if the serviceProvider is supported, or
rejected with an exception if the serviceProvider is unsupported or any error
occurs. The {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}
is usually a [=url-based payment method identifier=].

<div algorithm>
  When the
  <dfn method for="Window">getDigitalGoodsService(|serviceProvider|)</dfn>
  method is called, run the following steps:

  1. Let |document| be the [=current settings object=]'s [=relevant global object=]'s <a>associated <code>Document</code></a>.
  1. If |document| is not [=Document/fully active=], then return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{"InvalidStateError"}} {{DOMException}}.
  1. If |document|'s [=origin=] is not [=same origin=] with the [=environment/top-level origin=] return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{"NotAllowedError"}} {{DOMException}}.
  1. If |document| is not [=allowed to use=] the "[=payment=]" permission return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{"NotAllowedError"}} {{DOMException}}.
  1. If |serviceProvider| is undefined or null or the empty string return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{TypeError}}.
  1. Let |result| be the result of performing the [=can make digital goods service algorithm=] given |serviceProvider| and |document|.
  1. If |result| is false return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{OperationError}}.
  1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] a new {{DigitalGoodsService}}.
</div>

### Can make digital goods service algorithm ### {#sec-can-make-digital-goods-service-algorithm}
<div algorithm>
  The <dfn>can make digital goods service algorithm</dfn> checks whether the
  [=user agent=] supports a given |serviceProvider| and |document| context.

  1. The [=user agent=] MAY return true or return false based on the |serviceProvider| or |document| or external factors.

  Note: This allows for user agents to support different service providers in
  different contexts.
</div>


## DigitalGoodsService interface ## {#digitalgoodsservice-interface}

<xmp class="idl">
  [Exposed=Window, SecureContext] interface DigitalGoodsService {

    Promise<sequence<ItemDetails>> getDetails(sequence<DOMString> itemIds);

    Promise<sequence<PurchaseDetails>> listPurchases();

    Promise<sequence<PurchaseDetails>> listPurchaseHistory();

    Promise<undefined> consume(DOMString purchaseToken);
  };

  dictionary ItemDetails {
    required DOMString itemId;
    required DOMString title;
    required PaymentCurrencyAmount price;
    ItemType type;
    DOMString description;
    sequence<DOMString> iconURLs;
    DOMString subscriptionPeriod;
    DOMString freeTrialPeriod;
    PaymentCurrencyAmount introductoryPrice;
    DOMString introductoryPricePeriod;
    [EnforceRange] unsigned long long introductoryPriceCycles;
  };

  enum ItemType {
    "product",
    "subscription",
  };

  dictionary PurchaseDetails {
    required DOMString itemId;
    required DOMString purchaseToken;
  };
</xmp>

### getDetails() method ### {#getDetails-method}

<div algorithm>
  When the  <dfn method for="DigitalGoodsService">getDetails(|itemIds|)</dfn>
  method is called, run the following steps:

  <!-- TODO: Would like to give these type definitions like |itemIds:sequence<DOMString>| but it's not recognized (supported?) by BikeShed. -->
  1. If |itemIds| [=list/is empty=], then return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{TypeError}}.
  1. Let |result| be the result of requesting information about the given |itemIds| from the digital goods service.

  Note: This allows for different digital goods service providers to be
    supported by provider-specific behavior in the user agent.

  1. If |result| is an error, then return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{OperationError}}.
  1. For each |itemDetails| in |result|:
    1. |itemDetails|.itemId SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
    1. |itemIds| SHOULD [=list/contain=] |itemDetails|.itemId.
    1. |itemDetails|.title SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
    1. |itemDetails|.price MUST be a [=canonical PaymentCurrencyAmount=].
    1. If present, |itemDetails|.subscriptionPeriod MUST be be a [=iso-8601=] duration.
    1. If present, |itemDetails|.freeTrialPeriod MUST be be a [=iso-8601=] duration.
    1. If present, |itemDetails|.introductoryPrice MUST be a [=canonical PaymentCurrencyAmount=].
    1. If present, |itemDetails|.introductoryPricePeriod MUST be be a [=iso-8601=] duration.
  1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] |result|.

  Note: There is no requirement that the ordering of items in |result| matches
    the ordering of items in |itemIds|. This is to allow for missing or invalid
    items to be skipped in the output list.
</div>

### listPurchases() method ### {#listPurchases-method}

<div algorithm>
  When the <dfn method for="DigitalGoodsService">listPurchases()</dfn> method is
  called, run the following steps:

  1. Let |result| be the result of requesting information about the user's purchases from the digital goods service.

  Note: This allows for different digital goods service providers to be supported by provider-specific behavior in the user agent.

  1. If |result| is an error, then return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{OperationError}}.
  1. For each |itemDetails| in |result|:
    1. |itemDetails|.itemId SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
    1. |itemDetails|.purchaseToken SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
  1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] |result|.
</div>

### listPurchaseHistory() method ### {#listPurchaseHistory-method}

<div algorithm>
  When the <dfn method for="DigitalGoodsService">listPurchaseHistory()</dfn> method is
  called, run the following steps:

  1. Let |result| be the result of requesting information about the latest purchases for each item type ever purchased by the user.
  1. If |result| is an error, then return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{OperationError}}.
  1. For each |itemDetails| in |result|:
    1. |itemDetails|.itemId SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
    1. |itemDetails|.purchaseToken SHOULD NOT be the empty string.
  1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] |result|.
</div>

### consume() method ### {#consume-method}

Note: Consume in this context means to use up a purchase. The user is expected
to no longer be entitled to the purchase after it is consumed.

<div algorithm>
  When the <dfn method for="DigitalGoodsService">consume(|purchaseToken|)</dfn>
  method is called, run the following steps:

  1. If |purchaseToken| is the empty string, then return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{TypeError}}.
  1. Let |result| be the result of requesting the digital goods service to record |purchaseToken| as consumed.

  Note: This allows for different digital goods service providers to be supported by provider-specific behavior in the user agent.

  1. If |result| is an error, then return [=a promise rejected with=] an {{OperationError}}.
  1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] {{undefined}}.
</div>

## ItemDetails dictionary ## {#itemDetails-dictionary}

*This section is non-normative.*

<div class="note">
  An {{ItemDetails}} dictionary represents information about a digital item from
  a {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}.

  * {{ItemDetails/itemId}} identifies a particular digital item in the current
    app's inventory. It is expected to be unique within the app but might not be
    unique across all apps.
  * {{ItemDetails/title}} is the name of the item to display to the user. It is
    expected to have been localized for the user by the
    {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}.
  * {{ItemDetails/price}} is the price of the item and is intended to be able to
    be formatted as shown in the [[#querying-item-details]] example above for
    display to the user. It is expected to have been localized for the user by
    the {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}.
  * {{ItemDetails/type}} is one of the values of the {{ItemType}} enum.
  * {{ItemDetails/description}} is the full description of the item to display
    to the user. It is expected to have been localized for the user by the
    {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}.
  * {{ItemDetails/iconURLs}} is a list of icons that provide a visual
    description of the item.
  * {{ItemDetails/subscriptionPeriod}} is the time period, specified as an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations">ISO 8601 duration</a>,
    in which the item
    grants some entitlement to the user. After this period the entitlement is
    expected to be renewed or lost (this is not controlled through the Digital
    Goods API). This field is only expected to be set for subscriptions and not
    for one-off purchases.
  * {{ItemDetails/freeTrialPeriod}} is the time period, specified as an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations">ISO 8601 duration</a>,
    in which the item grants
    some entitlement to the user without costing anything. After this period the
    entitlement is expected to be paid or lost (this is not controlled through
    the Digital Goods API). This field is only expected to be set for
    subscriptions and not for one-off purchases.
  * {{ItemDetails/introductoryPrice}} is the initial price of the item and is
    intended to be able to be formatted as shown in the
    [[#querying-item-details]] example above for display to the user. It is
    expected to have been localized for the user by the
    {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}.
  * {{ItemDetails/introductoryPricePeriod}} is the time period, specified as an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations">ISO 8601 duration</a>,
    in which the item costs the {{ItemDetails/introductoryPrice}}. After this
    period the item is epected to cost the {{ItemDetails/price}}.
  * {{ItemDetails/introductoryPriceCycles}} is the number of subscription cycles
    during which the {{ItemDetails/introductoryPrice}} is effective.

## PurchaseDetails dictionary ## {#purchaseDetails-dictionary}

*This section is non-normative.*

<div class="note">
  A {{PurchaseDetails}} dictionary represents information about a digital item
  from a {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}
  which the user has purchased at some point.

  * {{PurchaseDetails/itemId}} identifies a particular digital item in the
    current app's inventory. It is expected to be unique within the app but
    might not be unique across all apps. It is expected to be equivalent to an
    {{ItemDetails/itemId}} as used in the {{DigitalGoodsService/getDetails()}}
    method.
  * {{PurchaseDetails/purchaseToken}} is an abitrary token representing a
    purchase as generated by the
    {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService(serviceProvider)/serviceProvider}}. It is
    intended to be able to be used to verify the purchase by contacting the
    service provider directly (not part of the Digital Goods API).
</div>

# Permissions Policy integration # {#permissions-policy-integration}

This specification defines a [=policy-controlled feature=] identified
by the string "[=payment=]". Its <a>default
allowlist</a> is '<code>self</code>'.

Note: A [=document's=] [=Document/permissions policy=] determines
whether any content in that document is allowed to get
{{DigitalGoodsService}} instances. If disabled in any document, no content
in the document will be [=allowed to use=] the {{Window/getDigitalGoodsService()}}
method (trying to call the method will throw).

# Additional Definitions # {#additional-definitions}
<!-- TODO Not sure how to reference this correctly. Needs to be exported from the other spec? -->
The "<dfn>payment</dfn>" permission is a [[permissions-policy]] feature
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dfn-payment-permission">defined
  in the payment-request spec</a>.

<!-- TODO Not sure how to reference this correctly. Needs to be exported from the other spec? -->
A <dfn>canonical {{PaymentCurrencyAmount}}</dfn> is a
{{PaymentCurrencyAmount}} <code>amount</code> that can be run through the steps to
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dfn-check-and-canonicalize-amount">
  check and canonicalize amount</a> without throwing any errors or being altered.

<!-- TODO figure out how to get iso-8601 to link to a definition. -->
<dfn>iso-8601</dfn> is a standard for date and time representations.
