Introduction {#intro}
============

Though cross-site scripting (XSS) is technically trivial to mitigate through proper escaping
techniques, it remains a somewhat pervasive risk to web applications. [=Content Security Policy=]
attempts to contain this risk by giving developers more control over the way script is executed on
a given page, and developers have had moderate success at rolling it out. They've also expressed
more than a little frustration with the complexity that's crept into CSP over time. 

Originally, CSP aimed to address script injection attacks by limiting the sources from which
scripts could be loaded. Over time, we learned that limiting scripts' sources was not a terribly
effective way of addressing the problem. [[CSP-IS-DEAD]] shifted experts' recommendations away from
a list of allowed sources for script, and towards more robust verification of individual <{script}>
elements via {{HTMLOrSVGElement/nonce}} attributes on the one hand, or integrity verification on
the other (see [[CSP#external-hash]]).

The [[ARTUR]] proposal is a tounge-in-cheek proposal that's a fairly bad idea as specified, but
seems like an interesting foundation conceptually. If we step back from CSP's current syntax, and
the contortions it takes to remain backwards compatible, it seems like we could extract a concise
and comprehensible mechanism that would encompass the kinds of requirements that hard experience
has taught us can be effective (e.g. those expressed in [[STRICT-CSP]]):

1.  Turn off dangerous parts of the platform that influence scripting (e.g. <{base}>, <{embed}>,
    and <{object}>.

2.  Create an out-of-band signal that a given script is intended to execute (e.g. the aforementioned
    nonces and hashes).

3.  Allow developers to roll the above out in a report-only manner.

This document aims to build upon that conceptual foundation, defining a [=/Scripting Policy=] that
governs the way script executes within a given context, focused entirely on mitigating injection
attacks in a way that developers can easily deploy.

Examples {#examples}
--------

Most users would be well-served with the following policy:

``` http
Scripting-Policy: nonce=number-used-once
```

This would have the effect of:

1.  Executing <a for="script">"parser-inserted"</a> script iff it has a {{HTMLOrSVGElement/nonce}}
    attribute matching the header-specified nonce (e.g.
    `<script nonce="number-used-once">...</script>`), and executing all
    non-<a for="script">"parser-inserted"</a> script in a manner similar to CSP's
    `'strict-dynamic'` keyword (see [[CSP#strict-dynamic-usage]]).

2.  Preventing <{base}> from changing the meaning of relative URLs.

3.  Blocking <code>eval({{DOMString}})</code>, while allowing <code>eval({{TrustedScript}})</code>.

4.  Blocking inline event handlers, XSLT, navigation to  `javascript:...`, <{embed}>, and
    <{object}>.

This is a pretty reasonable set of hurdles to put in front of an attacker.

Users with complicated sites might need more complicated policies that take advantage of optional
features, perhaps along the lines of:

``` http
Scripting-Policy: integrity=(hash1 hash2 hash3 hash4),
                  report-to=name,
                  trusted-types-policy=policyName
Scripting-Policy-Report-Only: integrity=(hash1 hash2 ...hash18 ... hash37),
                              eval=block,
                              dynamic-loading=checked,
                              report-to=name,
                              trusted-types-policy=policyName
```


Threat Model {#threat-model}
------------

Scripting Policy aims to deal soley with injection attacks that cause script execution. It does not
try to affect resource loading, mitigate data exfiltration, nor does it gate access to any feature
unrelated to script execution.

This mechanism assumes an attacker can:

1.  Cause a server to output unexpected content directly into the body of any given response,
    leading to "reflected" cross-site scripting.

2.  Manipulate the inputs to client-side code, causing "stored" or "DOM-based" cross-site scripting.

It does not address other, related attacks. In particular, it assumes that attackers cannot reliably
inject headers into a server's response.

ISSUE: Extend this description.

Overview {#overview}
--------

<em>This section is non-normative (but hopefully helpful anyway).</em>

At its core, this story this document wants to tell is the following:

1.  [=/Scripting Policy=] objects define the ways in which script can be executed within a given
    Document, Worker, etc. They have a number of properties that influence different aspects of
    script execution, defined in some detail in [[#framework]].

2.  These policies are delivered as HTTP response headers: <a http-header>`Scripting-Policy`</a>
    defines a policy to be enforced in a given context, and
    <a http-header>`Scripting-Policy-Report-Only`</a> a policy to be reported upon, but not
    enforced.

    The headers' syntax is defined in [[#scripting-policy-header]], and parsing rules are in
    [[#scripting-policy-header-parsing]].

3.  Policies are bound to {{Document}}, {{WorkerGlobalScope}}, and {{WorkletGlobalScope}} objects
    when each is initialized. Each object obtain a policy from the HTTP response used when
    initializing the document or worker, or from the context responsible for the document's
    navigation or worker's instantiation if that response has a [=local scheme=] (e.g. `data:`,
    `about:`, `blob:`, etc.). These details are spelled out in [[#initialize-doc]] and
    [[#initialize-global]].

4.  A policy's effects are enforced in a given context through hooks in HTML:

    *   Nonces and hashes are enforced by policy in HTML's [=prepare a script=] algorithm, and rely
        upon the existing {{HTMLOrSVGElement/nonce}} and <{script/integrity}> attributes,
        respectively, for enforcement. Hashes further rely upon Subresource Integrity [[SRI]]
        enforcement in Fetch's [=main fetch=] algorithm.

    *   Inline event handlers rely upon [=scripting policy/integrity=] assertions for enforcement.
        Details in [[#check-event-handlers]].

    *   <{base}>'s effects are gated via hooks in the [=set the frozen base URL=] algorithm, detailed
        in [[#check-base]].

    *   <{embed}> and <{object}> are gated via hooks in their respective intialization mechanisms,
        detailed in [[#check-embed-object]].

    *   `eval()` is gated via HTML's implementation of JavaScript's
        <a lt="hostensurecancompilestrings(callerrealm, calleerealm)" dfn>HTML's implementation</a> of
        JavaScript's {{HostEnsureCanCompileStrings()}} abstract operation, detailed in
        [[#hostensurecancompilestrings]].

    *   ISSUE: Trusted types integration.

    *   Reporting relies upon the Reporting API [[REPORTING]], defining a "`scripting-policy`"
        report type via the {{ScriptingPolicyReportBody}} interface. Details in [[#reporting]].

The rest of the document's structure follows this general outline: [[#framework]] defines the
concepts we'll need, and the header delivery mechanism. [[#policy-application]] shows how policies
are associated with the contexts that love them. [[#policy-enforcement]] explains how HTML and
Fetch make decisions about how code is executed.

Enjoy!


Dependencies {#deps}
------------

The rest of the document relies upon [=Structured Headers=] to define policies' header syntax
[[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]]. It also depends upon the Infra Standard for a number of
foundational concepts used in its algorithms and prose [[!INFRA]].


Framework {#framework}
=========

A <dfn export local-lt="Scripting Policies">Scripting Policy</dfn> defines the characteristics of
script execution in a given context, and may have effect on a {{Document}}, {{WorkerGlobalScope}},
or {{WorkletGlobalScope}}, as described in [[#initialize-doc]] and [[#initialize-global]].

Each policy has a <dfn for="scripting policy" export>nonce</dfn> member, which is either `null` or a
[=string=] representing a cryptographic "number-used-once". Unless otherwise specified, its value
is `null`.

Note: The `nonce` member defines a "number-used-once" which must be reflected in <{script}>
elements' {{HTMLOrSVGElement/nonce}} attribute in order to enable script execution. This check is
performed during HTML's [=prepare a script=] algorithm, as described in [[#policy-enforcement]].

Each policy has an <dfn for="scripting policy" export>integrity</dfn> member, which is either `null`, or a
[=list=] either `null` or a list of [=integrity metadata=] objects. Unless otherwise specified, its
value is `null`.

Note: The `integrity` member is a list of [=integrity metadata=] that define the set of scripts
which can be executed on a given page, layering on top of [[SRI]] for enforcement. This check is
performed during Fetch's [=main fetch=] algorithm, as described in [[#policy-enforcement]].

Each policy has an <dfn for="scripting policy" export>eval</dfn> member, which is either "`allow`",
"`blocked`", or "`allow-trustedscript`". Unless otherwise specified, its value is
"`allow-trustedscript`".

Note: The `eval` member influences the way `eval()` is processed (shocking, right?). "`allow`"
places no restriction upon `eval()`. "`blocked`" causes both `eval(TrustedScript)` and
`eval(DOMString)` to throw. "`allow-trustedscript`" causes `eval(DOMString)` to throw, but allows
`eval(TrustedScript)` to execute. This is detailed in [[#hostensurecancompilestrings]].

Each policy has a <dfn for="scripting policy" export>report-to</dfn> member, which is either `null`,
or a [=string=] representing a [=report/group|reporting group=], as defined in [[!REPORTING]].
Unless otherwise specified, its value is `null`.

Note: The `report-to` member wires Scripting Policy enforcement up to the Reporting API in order to
inform developers about violations on their pages. This is detailed in [[#reporting]].

Each policy has a <dfn for="scripting policy" export>trusted-types-required-for</dfn> member, which
is either `null`, or a [=list=] of [=strings=] representing categories for which Trusted Types are
enforced. Unless otherwise specified, its value is `null`.

Note: The `trusted-types-require-for` member configures Trusted Type enforcement. The only currently
valid category is "`script`".

Each policy has a <dfn for="scripting policy" export>dynamic-loading</dfn> member, which is either
"`allow-non-parser-inserted`", or "`check-non-parser-inserted`". Unless otherwise specified, its
value is "`allow-non-parser-inserted`".

Note: The `dynamic-loading` member controls how script that executes in a given context can cause
more script to execute. "`allow-non-parser-inserted`" means that non-[=script/"parser-inserted"=]
scripts will execute, regardless of [=scripting policy/nonce=] or [=scripting policy/integrity=]
enforcement. "`check-non-parser-inserted`" will not privilege non-[script/"parser-inserted"=]
script in any way, applying all checks that were applied to the original script.

ISSUE: Names are hard, but `{allow,check}-non-parser-inserted` are terrible.

[=Scripting Policies=] are often found in a <dfn export>Scripting Policy pair</dfn>, combining
one enforced policy with one policy which is unenforced, and merely reported upon. This is a
[=pair=] whose first [=struct/item=] is named <dfn export for="scripting policy pair">enforced</dfn>
and whose second [=struct/item=] is named <dfn export for="scripting policy pair">report-only</dfn>.
Both [=struct/items=] are either `null` or a [=/Scripting Policy=] object. Unless otherwise
specified, their values are both `null`.

Scripting Policy HTTP Response Headers {#scripting-policy-header}
--------------------------------------

Servers can serialize [=/Scripting Policy=] objects, and deliver them to user agents via HTTP
response headers that declare the scripting requirements for a given response. The
<dfn http-header export>`Scripting-Policy`</dfn> HTTP response header informs a user agent about
the scripting requirements which are to be enforced for a given response. The
<dfn http-header export>`Scripting-Policy-Report-Only`</dfn> HTTP response header has the same
grammar and semantics as <a http-header>`Scripting-Policy`</a>, but declares a policy that is not
enforced in a given context, but merely reported upon.

Both are [=Structured Headers=] whose value MUST be a [=structured header/dictionary=]
[[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]]. Their ABNF is:

```
Scripting-Policy = scripting-policy-dict
Scripting-Policy-Report-Only = scripting-policy-dict
scripting-policy-dict = sh-dictionary
```

Note: The <a grammar>sh-dictionary</a> type is defined along with Structured Header's
[=structured header/dictionary=] concept in Section 3.2 of [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]].

The <dfn dictionary>scripting-policy-dict</dfn> [=structured header/dictionary=] MAY contain one or
more of the following members:

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>nonce</dfn>
::  The member's value is a [=structured header/token=], which maps to the [=/Scripting Policy=]'s
    [=scripting policy/nonce=] member.

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>integrity</dfn>
::  The member's value is a [=structured header/list=] of [=structured header/token=] values, which
    are processed as [=request/integrity metadata=] values, and map to the [=/Scripting Policy=]'s
    [=scripting policy/integrity=] member.

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>eval</dfn>
::  The member's value is an enum represented as one of the following [=structured header/tokens=]:
    "`allow`", "`blocked`", and "`allow-trustedscript`". It maps to the [=/Scripting Policy=]'s
    [=scripting policy/eval=] member.

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>report-to</dfn>
::  The member's value is a [=structured header/token=], which maps to the [=/Scripting Policy=]'s
    [=scripting policy/report-to=] member.

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>trusted-types-required-for</dfn>
::  The member's value is a [=structured header/list=] of [=structured header/token=] values, which
    maps to the [=/Scripting Policy=]'s [=scripting policy/trusted-types-required-for=] member.

:   <dfn for="scripting-policy-dict" export>dynamic-loading</dfn>
::  The member's value is an enum represented as one of the following [=structured header/tokens=]:
    "`allow-non-parser-inserted`", and "`check-non-parser-inserted`". It maps to the
    [=/Scripting Policy=]'s [=scripting policy/dynamic-loading=] member.

Both headers are currently meaningful only for responses that result in a navigation to a new
document, as well as for responses that are executed as {{Worker}}, {{SharedWorker}}, and
{{ServiceWorker}}. Detailed processing rules are found in [[#policy-enforcement]].

    Note: Parsing errors fail open for compatibility with future changes to the dictionary names and

    cannot be interpreted as a [=Structured Header=] per the
    [$parse structured header|parsing rules$] defined in [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]], no
    policy will be applied. This explicitly prioritizes forward compatibility with future iterations
    of [=Structured Headers=], which may be surprising. User agents are encouraged to warn
    developers in this case.

<h3 id="initialize-doc">Initialize a Document's Scripting Policy</h3>

A {{Document}}'s [=document/scripting policy=] comes from one of two places: the [=response=] to
which the user agent navigated, or the [=environment settings object=] responsible for a navigation
to a [=local scheme=] (e.g. `data:`, `blob:`, `about:`). In particular, note that this latter case
covers `<iframe srcdoc>`.

<div algorithm="initialize document">
    Given a {{Document}} (|document|), a [=response=] (|response|), and a [=request=] or `null`

    by executing the following steps:

    1.  If |request| is not `null`, and |response|'s [=response/url=]'s [=url/scheme=] is a

Policy Enforcement {#policy-enforcement}
------------------

### Checking Nonces and Hashes ### {#check-nonce-hash}

Scripting Policy's restrictions on <{script}> execution are generally performed during HTML's
[=prepare a script=] algorithm, before requests are fired for externalized scripts, and prior to
evaluating inline scripts.

Note: If a policy sets requirements for both a [=scripting policy/nonce=] and some set of
[=scripting policy/integrity=], either will be sufficient to allow script execution. That is,
the policy `nonce=abcdefg, integrity=(sha256-123456)` would allow execution for each of
`<script nonce="abcdefg"></script>`, `<script integrity="sha256-123456"></script>`, and
`<script nonce="abcdefg" integrity="sha256-123456"></script>`.

<div algorithm="block script element">
    To <dfn local-lt="block script element" abstract-op>determine whether a script element should
    be blocked by Scripting Policy</dfn>, given an {{Element}} (|el|), execute the following
    algorithm. It will return "`Blocked`" or "`Allowed`".

Reporting Violations {#reporting}
--------------------

<dfn export>Scripting Policy reports</dfn> provide developers with context when a given page or
