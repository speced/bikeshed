Abstract:
    Credentialless is a Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) variant. Similarly to
    [require-corp](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#embedder-policy-value), it can
    be used to enable [cross-origin-isolation](#cross-origin-isolation). Contrary to require-corp,
    it is easier to deploy, instead of requiring a Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header for
    every no-cors subresources, COEP:credentialless is requesting them without credentials.

A problem {#problem}
====================

Sites that wish to continue using SharedArrayBuffer must opt-into cross-origin
isolation. Among other things, cross-origin isolation will block the use of
cross-origin resources and documents unless those resources opt-into inclusion
via either CORS or CORP. This behavior ships today in Firefox, and Chrome aims
to ship it as well in 2021H1.

The opt-in requirement is generally positive, as it ensures that developers have
the opportunity to adequately evaluate the rewards of being included cross-site
against the risks of potential data leakage via those environments. It poses
adoption challenges, however, as it does require developers to adjust their
servers to send an explicit opt-in. This is challenging in cases where there's
not a single developer involved, but many. Google Earth, for example, includes
user-generated content in sandboxed frames, and it seems somewhat unlikely that
they'll be able to ensure that all the resources typed in by all their users
over the years will do the work to opt-into being loadable.

Cases like Earth are, likely, outliers. Still, it seems clear that adoption of
any opt-in mechanism is going to be limited. From a deployment perspective
(especially with an eye towards changing default behaviors), it would be ideal
if we could find an approach that provided robust-enough protection against
accidental cross-process leakage without requiring an explicit opt-in.

A proposal {#proposal}
==========

The goal of the existing opt-in is to block interesting data that an attacker
wouldn't otherwise have access to from flowing into a process they control. It
might be possible to obtain a similar result by minimizing the risk that
outgoing requests will generate responses personalized to a specific user by
extending [coep](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#coep) to
support a new `credentialless` mode which strips credentials (cookies, client
certs, etc) by default for no-cors subresource requests. Let's explore that
addition first, then look at whether it's Good Enough to enable cross-origin
isolation.

Subresource requests {#subresource-requests}
--------------------

In this new COEP variant, cross-origin no-cors subresource requests would be
sent without credentials. Specific requests which require credentials can
opt-into including them, at the cost of shifting the request's mode to require a
[CORS check](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-cors-check) on the response.
This bifurcation between credentiallessness and CORS means either that servers
don't have browser-provided identifiers which could be used to personalize a
response (see the isolation section below), or that they explicitly opt-in to
exposing the response's content to the requesting origin.

As an example, consider a developer who wishes to load an image into a context
isolated in the way described above. The `<img>` element has a `crossorigin`
attribute which allows developers to alter the outgoing request's state. In this
new mode, the following table describes the outgoing request's properties in
Fetch's terms for various values:

<table class="data">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td> Resource
      <td> Request's [Mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode)
      <td> Request's [Credentials Mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode)
      <td> [includeCredentials](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch) <sub> COEP:unsafe-none</sub>
      <td> [includeCredentials](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch) <sub> COEP:credentialless</sub>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`<img src="https://same-origin/">` 
      <td>`same-origin` 
      <td>`include` 
      <td>`true` 
      <td>`true`
    </tr>

    <tr style="background-color:rgba(255,0,0,0.08)">
      <td>`<img src="https://cross-origin/">` 
      <td>`no-cors` 
      <td>`include` 
      <td>`true` 
      <td><strong>`false`</strong>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>&lt;img src="https://cross-origin/" <strong>crossorigin="anonymous"</strong>></code> 
      <td>`no-cors` 
      <td>`omit` 
      <td>`false` 
      <td>`false`
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>&lt;img src="https://cross-origin/" <strong>crossorigin="use-credentials"</strong>></code> 
      <td>`cors` 
      <td>`include` 
      <td>`true` 
      <td>`true`
    </tr>

    </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

### redirect ### {#redirect}

The decision to include credentials is done indepently for each request. The
variable
[includeCredentials](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch)
is set for the initial request, but also after each redirect.

For example, credentials are not included for a cross-origin no-cors request,
but they can be added in the next request if it redirects to a same-origin
resource.

Main resource requests {#main-resource-request}
----------------------

Cross-origin nested navigational requests (`<iframe>`, etc) are more
complicated, as they present risks different in kind from subresources. Frames
create a browsing context with an origin distinct from the parent, which has
implications on the data it has access to via requests on the one hand and
storage APIs on the other. Given this capability, it seems clear that we can't
just strip credentials from the nested navigational request and call it a day in
the same way that we could with subresources.

For this reason, `COEP:credentialless` must be as strict as `COEP:require-corp`
for navigational requests. It works identically.

That is to say:
1. If the parent sets `COEP:credentialless` or `COEP:require-corp`, then the
    children must also use one of those headers. The two COEP values can be used
    and mixed in any order. If the children uses `COEP:unsafe-none`, its
    response is blocked.
2. If the parent sets `COEP:credentialless` or `COEP:require-corp`, then the
    children is required to specify a CORP header when the response is
    cross-origin.

Note: To help developers with embedding cross-origin `<iframe>` without
opt-in from the embeddee, the [anonymous
iframe](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/639) project has been
proposed. It is orthogonal to `COEP:credentialless`, which only affects
subresources.

CacheStorage requests {#cache-storage-request}
---------------------
  
See the issue:
[w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1592](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1592)

With CacheStorage's put() and match() methods, a response fetched from a
`COEP:unsafe-none` context can be retrieved from a  `COEP:credentialless` or
`COEP:require-corp` context.

Similarly to `COEP:require-corp`, the behavior of CacheStorage must be specified
for `COEP:credentialless`.

The solution proposed is to store the `includecredentials` variable from the
[http-network-or-cache-fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch)
algorithm into the response. Then during the [corp
check](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cross-origin-resource-policy-internal-check),
to require CORP for responses requested with credentials.

Cross-origin Isolation {#cross-origin-isolation}
----------------------------------------------------------

Above, we asserted that the core goal of the existing opt-in requirement is to
block interesting data that an attacker wouldn't otherwise have access to from
flowing into a process they control. Removing credentials from outgoing requests
seems like quite a reasonable way to deal with this for the kinds of requests
which may vary based on browser-mediated credentials (cookies, client certs,
etc). In these cases, `COEP:credentialless` would seem to substantially mitigate
the risk of personalized data flowing into an attacker's process.

Some servers, however, don't actually use browser-mediated credentials to
control access to a resource. They may examine the network characteristics of a
user's request (originating IP address, [relationship with the
telco](https://datapass.de/), etc) in order to determine whether and how to
respond; or they might not even be accessible to attackers directly, instead
requiring a user to be in a privileged network position. These resources would
continue to leak data in a credentialless model.

Let's assert for the moment that servers accessible only via a privileged
network position can be dealt with entirely by putting a wall between "public"
and "private", along the lines of the [[private-network-access]]. Successfully
rolling out that kind of model would address the threat of this kind of leakage.
As such [[private-network-access]] is a dependency of COEP:credentialless.

IP-based authentication models are, on the other hand, more difficult to
address. Though the practice is unfortunate in itself (users should have control
over their state vis a vis servers they interact with on the one hand, and
sensitive data should [assume a zero-trust
network](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp) on the other), we know it's used
in the wild for things like telco billing pages. In a credentialless isolation
model, resources these servers expose would continue to flow into cross-origin
processes unless and until they explicitly opted-out of that inclusion via CORP.
We can minimize the risk of these attacks by increasing CORB's robustness on the
one hand, and [requiring opt-in for embedded
usage](https://goto.google.com/embedding-requires-consent) on the other.

This leaves us with a trade-off to evaluate: `COEP:credentialless` seems
substantially easier than `COEP:require-corp` to deploy, both as an opt-in in
the short-term, and (critically) as default behavior in the long term. It does
substantially reduce the status quo risk. At the same time, it doesn't prevent a
category of resources from flowing into attackers' processes. We have reasonable
ideas about one chunk of these resources, and would simply not protect the other
without explicit opt-in.

Perhaps that's a trade-off worth taking? The mechanism seems worth defining
regardless, even if we don't end up considering it a fully cross-origin isolated
context.

The rest of this document monkey-patches [[HTML]], [[Fetch]] in order to
document the details of the bits and pieces discussed above.

Integration with HTML {#integration-html}
=====================

Note: This corresponds to the following HTML specification change:
[whatwg/html/pull/6638](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6638).

Embedder policy value {#embedder-policy-value}
---------------------

In the [embedder-policy-value](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#embedder-policy-value) section, add the
`credentialless` value:

<div class="monkey-patch">
  <p>An <dfn ignore="">embedder policy value</dfn> controls the fetching of cross-origin resources
  without explicit permission from resource owners. There are three such values:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>"<dfn ignore="" data-x="coep-unsafe-none" for="embedder policy value"><code
   data-x="">unsafe-none</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd><p>This is the default value. When this value is used, cross-origin resources can be fetched
   without giving explicit permission through the <span>CORS protocol</span> or the
   '<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code>' header.</p></dd>

   <dt>"<dfn ignore="" data-x="coep-require-corp" export for="embedder policy value"><code
   data-x="">require-corp</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd><p>When this value is used, fetching cross-origin resources requires the server's
   explicit permission through the <span>CORS protocol</span> or the
   '<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code>' header.</p></dd>

   <dt>"<dfn export data-x="coep-credentialless" export for="embedder policy value"><code
   data-x="">credentialless</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd><p>When this value is used, fetching cross-origin no-CORS resources omits credentials. In
   exchange, and explicit '<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code>' is not required. Other
   requests sent with credentials requires the server's explicit permission through the <span>CORS
   protocol</span> or the '<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code>' header.</p></dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Parsing {#parsing}
-------

In [obtain-an-embedder-policy](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#obtain-an-embedder-policy),

Step 4 about Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy becomes:
<div algorithm="obtain-an-embedder-policy-step-4">
  <p>4. If <var>parsedItem</var> is non-null and <var>parsedItem</var>[0] is "<code
  data-x="">credentialless</code>" or "<code data-x="">require-corp</code>":</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Set <var>policy</var>'s <span data-x="embedder-policy-value">value</span> to
   <var>parsedItem</var>[0].</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>parsedItem</var>[1]["<code data-x="coep-report-to">report-to</code>"] <span
   data-x="map exists">exists</span>, then set <var>policy</var>'s <span
   data-x="embedder-policy-reporting-endpoint">endpoint</span> to <var>parsedItem</var>
   [1]["<code data-x="coep-report-to">report-to</code>"].</p></li>
</div>

Step 6 about Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only becomes:
<div algorithm="obtain-an-embedder-policy-step-6">
  <p>6. If <var>parsedItem</var> is non-null and <var>parsedItem</var>[0] is "<code
  data-x="">credentialless</code>" or "<code data-x="">require-corp</code>":</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Set <var>policy</var>'s <span
   data-x="embedder-policy-report-only-value">value</span> to <var>parsedItem</var>[0].</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>parsedItem</var>[1]["<code data-x="coep-report-to">report-to</code>"] <span
   data-x="map exists">exists</span>, then set <var>policy</var>'s <span
   data-x="embedder-policy-report-only-reporting-endpoint">endpoint</span> to
   <var>parsedItem</var>[1]["<code data-x="coep-report-to">report-to</code>"].</p></li>
</div>


`Compatible with cross-origin isolation` algorithm {#compatible-with-cross-origin-isolation}
------------------------------------------------

`COEP:credentialess` and `COEP:require-corp` differ in the Fetch specification.
However, from the HTML specification point of view, they behave similarly. They
are referenced together with the `compatible with cross-origin isolation`
algorithm.

<div class="monkey-patch">
  <p>An <span>embedder policy value</span> is <dfn ignore="">compatible with cross-origin isolation</dfn> if it
  it either "<code data-x="coep-credentialless">credentialless</code>" or "<code
  data-x="coep-require-corp">require-corp</code>".</p>
</div>

Then replace every occurrence of:

<table class="data">
  <thead>
    <th><span>Old</span></th>
    <th><span>Replacement</span></th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <var>coep</var>'s <span data-x="embedder-policy-value">value</span> is "<code
        data-x="coep-require-corp">require-corp</code>".
      <td>
        <var>coep</var>'s <span data-x="embedder-policy-value">value</span> is <span>compatible with
        cross-origin isolation</span>.
    <tr>
      <td>
        <var>coep</var>'s <span data-x="embedder-policy-value">value</span> is "<code
        data-x="coep-unsafe-none">unsafe-none</code>".
      <td>
        <var>coep</var>'s <span data-x="embedder-policy-value">value</span> is not <span>compatible with
        cross-origin isolation</span>.
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

There are 10 occurrences to be replaced. In particular:
1. COEP:credentialless can be used to enable cross-origin isolation, the same way
    COEP:require-corp does.
2. If a document has a COEP policy compatible with cross-origin isolation, then the
    documents loaded in its `<iframe>` must also have a COEP policy compatible
    with , or be blocked.

Integration with Fetch {#integration-fetch}
======================

Note: This corresponds to the following Fetch specification change:
[whatwg/fetch/pull/1229](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1229)

Omit credentials for no-cors cross-origin requests {#fetch-coep-allow-credentials}
--------------------------------------------------

Add the following algorithm:

<div class="monkey-patch">
  <p>To check <dfn export>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy allows credentials</dfn>, given a
  <a for=/>request</a> <var>request</var>, run theses steps:

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>request</var>'s <a for=request>mode</a> is not <code>no-cors</code>", return
   true.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>request</var>'s <a for=request>client</a> is null, return true.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>request</var>'s <a for=request>client</a>'s <a for="environment settings
   object">policy container</a>'s <a for="policy container">embedder policy</a>  is not "<code><a
   for="embedder policy value">credentialless</a></code>", return true.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>request</var>'s <a for=request>origin</a> is <a>same origin</a> with
   <var>request</var>'s <a for=request>current URL</a>'s <a for=url>origin</a>, return true.</p>

   <li><p>Return false.</p>
  </ol>
</div>

Then, use it in the step 8.4. of the [HTTP-network-or-cache
fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch)
algorithm:
<div class="monkey-patch">
   <p>If <a>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy allows credentials</a> with <var>request</var> returns
   false, set <var>includeCredentials</var> to false.</p>
</div>

The response's request-include-credentials attribute {#request-include-credentials}
----------------------------------------------------

In the [response](https://whatpr.org/fetch/1229.html#responses) section, add:

<div class="monkey-patch">
  <p>A <a for=/>response</a> has an associated
  <dfn for=response id=concept-response-request-include-credentials>request-include-credentials</dfn>
  (a boolean), which is initially true.
</div>

In the
[http-network-or-cache-fetch](https://whatpr.org/fetch/1229.html#http-network-or-cache-fetch)
algorithm. Add step:

<div class="monkey-patch">
 <p>13. Set <var>response</var>'s <a
 for=response>request-include-credentials</a> to <var>includeCredentials</var>.
</div>

Note: This attribute is used to require corp for opaque credentialled response
retrieved via CacheStorage in COEP:credentialless context. See the
[cache-storage-request](#cache-storage-request) section.  

Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy internal check {#corp-internal-check}
-------------------------------------------

Modify the step 5 from the
[cross-origin-resource-policy-internal-check](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cross-origin-resource-policy-internal-check)

<div class="monkey-patch">
 <p>5. If <var>policy</var> is null, switch on <var ignore="">embedderPolicyValue</var>:
 <dl class=switch>
  <dt>"<a for="embedder policy value">unsafe-none</a>"
  <dd> Do nothing.

  <dt>"<a for="embedder policy value">credentialless</a>"
  <dd> Set <var>policy</var> to "<code>same-origin</code>" if one of the following is true:
  <ul>
   <li><var>response</var>'s <a for="response">request-include-credentials</a> is true.

   Note: See the [cache-storage-request](#cache-storage-request) requirement.

   <li><var ignore="">forNavigation</var> is true.

   Note: See the [main-resource-request](#main-resource-request) requirement.
  </ul>

  <dt>"<a for="embedder policy value">require-corp</a>"
  <dd> Set <var>policy</var> to "<code>same-origin</code>".
 </dl>
</div>

Integration with ServiceWorker {#integration-service-worker}
============================================================

There are no change to the ServiceWorker specification. The CacheStorage issue:
[w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1592](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1592)
is entirely resolved in this [section](#corp-internal-check) by modifying the
Fetch specification.


Security and privacy considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

This allows embedding cross-origin resources with no explicit opt-in into a
cross-origin isolated process. This process has access to powerful
features like SharedArrayBuffer or precise timers. An attacker can exploit
[[Spectre]] more easily. The attacker can potentially read the whole process
memory and read those resources. This concern has been addressed in the
[cross-origin-isolation](#cross-origin-isolation) section.
