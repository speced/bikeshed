Abstract:
	This specification defines an API that allows websites to convert from a given
	{{KeyboardEvent/code}} value to a
	valid {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value that can be shown to the user to
	identify the given key.
	The conversion from {{KeyboardEvent/code}} to {{KeyboardEvent/key}} is based on
	the user's currently selected keyboard layout.
	It is intended to be used by web applications that want to treat the keyboard as a
	set of buttons and need to describe those buttons to the user.

Status Text:
	This document is an editor's draft proposed as a First Public Working Draft.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	On a {{KeyboardEvent}}, the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute encodes
	a value that represents the physical location of the key that was pressed. This value
	ignores the current locale (e.g., "en-US"), layout (e.g., "dvorak") and modifier state
	(e.g., "Shift + Control"), so it is ideally suited for applications (like games) that
	want to use the keyboard as a set of generic buttons. The idea behind the
	{{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is that it provides a platform-neutral
	[=scancode=] for each physical key.

	The {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute, on the other hand, contains the value that is
	generated by the key press, accounting for the locale, layout, and modifier
	keys. Almost every Unicode character is a valid `key` attribute, along with a number
	of special named values (see {{KeyboardEvent}} [=key attribute values=]),
	so there are thousands of possible {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values.

	Because most users have a physical keyboard that matches their locale and layout,
	we can reasonably assume that the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value is a good stand-in for
	the glyph printed on the keycap. While this does not hold true when the user has
	selected a different layout, in that case the user is well-aware of the mismatch
	between the glyph on the keycap and the character generated by a key press.
	
	The API described in this document provides a simple way of obtaining this basic
	{{KeyboardEvent/code}} to {{KeyboardEvent/key}} mapping.

			When [=getLayoutMap()=] is called, the user agent must
			run the following steps:

			1. Let |p| be a new {{Promise}}.
			
			1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
			
				1. Let |map| be a new {{KeyboardLayoutMap}} that is initially empty.
		
				1. For each value |code| in the "KeyboardEvent code" column of the
					[=Writing System Keys=] table

					1. Let |layout| be the highest priority ASCII-capable keyboard layout,
						or the highest priority keyboard layout if none of the available
						layouts are ASCII-capable.

						Issue: Do we need the ability to select the highest-prio layout
						regardless of whether or not it is ASCII-capable?
						See <a href="https://github.com/wicg/keyboard-map/issues/1">Github Issue #1</a>

					1. If |code| is not a valid key in the |layout|, then continue
				
					1. Let |key| be the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value that would be generated
						by |layout|
						if the key identified by |code| was pressed with no modifiers.

					1. If |key| is a [=dead key=], then
				
						1. Set |key| to the string formed by a space " " followed by the
							combining character that corresponds to the [=dead key=].
						
					1. Create a map entry |e| from the pair < |code|, |key| >
				
					1. Add |e| to |map|.
			
				1. Resolve |p| with |map|.
			
			1. Return |p|.

			<div></div>
			
			User agents may choose to cache the |map| and return the cached value as
			long as the cache is updated (or invalidated) whenever the keyboard layout
			changes.
			
			<div class="example">
			To show instructions about which key to press in a game:
			<pre>
				navigator.keyboard.getLayoutMap().then(function(map) {
					var keyUp = map.get("KeyW");
					showUserDialog("Press " + keyUp + " to move up.");
				});
			</pre>
			</div>

			<div class="example">
			On a "US International" keyboard where the single-quote (') key is a
			[=dead key=] that adds an acute accent to the following character.
			The keyboard map would contain an entry mapping [=Quote=] (the 
			{{KeyboardEvent/code}} for this key) to the 2 character string
			U+0020 U+0301 (which is a space followed by the Unicode Combining Acute Accent).

<h2 id="keyboard-events">Keyboard Events</h2>

	<h3 id="keyboardchange-event">The <dfn>keyboardchange</dfn> Event</h2>
	
		The [=keyboardchange=] event fires whenever the current keyboard layout is
		changed.

		Issue: Bikeshed on name for this event.
		See <a href="https://github.com/wicg/keyboard-map/issues/6">Github Issue #6</a>
		 
		If the keyboard layout changes while the user agent is not the foreground
		application, then the [=keyboardchange=] event MUST fire when the user agent
		regains focus.
	
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile Device Considerations</h2>

	Since this is a keyboard-focused API and mobile devices do not commonly
	have physical keyboards, this API will not typically be present or
	supported on mobile devices.

<h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

	This API returns static data and does not change any system state, so there are
	no special security concerns.
	
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

	As with all APIs that return information about the current device state, there is
	a risk of using this API to create a larger "fingerprint" of the user than if this
	API was not available.
	
	By returning info from the highest priority ASCII-capable keyboard layout instead of
	the active layout, the value of this information for fingerprinting is reduced since
	users are more likely to share the same values.
	
	Without this API, similar fingerprinting can still be attempted, but it is more
	difficult since it would require the user to interact with the page by typing
	characters and analyze the resulting {{KeyboardEvent}}s.

	To help address this concern, this API is only available in secure contexts.
