<h3 id="document-prerendering">Extensions to the {{Document}} interface</h3>

We'd modify [[HTML]]'s centralized definition of {{Document}} as follows:

<pre class="idl">
  partial interface Document {
      readonly attribute boolean prerendering;

      // Under "special event handler IDL attributes that only apply to Document objects"
      attribute EventHandler onprerenderingchange;
  };
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for="Document">onprerenderingchange</dfn> attribute is an [=event handler IDL attribute=] corresponding to the <dfn event for="Document">prerenderingchange</dfn> [=event handler event type=]. (We would update the corresponding table in [[HTML]], which currently only contains {{Document/onreadystatechange}}.)

As is customary for [[HTML]], the definition of {{Document/prerendering}} would be located in another section of the spec; we'd place it in the new section introduced below:

<h3 id="prerendering-navigables">Prerendering navigables</h3>

<em>The following section would be added as a new sub-section of [[HTML]]'s <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#navigables">Navigables</a> section.</em>

Every [=navigable=] has a <dfn for="navigable">loading mode</dfn>, which is one of the following:

: "`default`"
:: No special considerations are applied to content loaded in this navigable
: "`prerender`"
:: This navigable is displaying prerendered content

By default, a [=navigable=]'s [=navigable/loading mode=] is "`default`". A navigable whose [=navigable/loading mode=] is "`prerender`" is known as a <dfn>prerendering navigable</dfn>. A [=prerendering navigable=] that is also a [=top-level traversable=] is known as a <dfn>prerendering traversable</dfn>.

<p class="note">Although there are only two values for the [=navigable/loading mode=], we use a flexible structure in anticipation of other future loading modes, such as those provided by fenced frames, portals, and uncredentialed (cross-site) prerendering. It's not yet clear whether that anticipation is correct; if, as those features gain full specifications, it turns out not to be, we will instead convert this into a boolean.

<dl class="domintro">
  <dt><code><var ignore>document</var>.{{Document/prerendering}}</code></dt>

  <dd>Returns true if the page is being presented in a non-interactive "prerendering-like" context. In the future, this would include a visible document in a `<portal>` element, both when loaded into it or via predecessor adoption.
</dl>

The <dfn attribute for="Document">prerendering</dfn> getter steps are to return true if [=this=] has a non-null [=node navigable=] that is a [=prerendering navigable=]; otherwise, false.

<hr>

Every {{Document}} has a <dfn for="Document">prerendering traversables map</dfn>, which is an [=ordered map=] of [=URLs=] to [=prerendering traversables=]. This is used to fulfill [=navigate|navigations=] to a given URL by instead [=prerendering traversable/activating=] the corresponding prerendering traversable.

Every {{Document}} has a <dfn for="Document">post-prerendering activation steps list</dfn>, which is a [=list=] where each [=list/item=] is a series of algorithm steps. For convenience, we define the <dfn for="platform object">post-prerendering activation steps list</dfn> for any platform object |platformObject| as:

<dl class="switch">
  : If |platformObject| is a [=node=]
  :: 1. Return |platformObject|'s [=Node/node document=]'s [=Document/post-prerendering activation steps list=].
  : Otherwise
  :: 1. Assert: |platformObject|'s [=relevant global object=] is a {{Window}} object.
  :: 1. Return |platformObject|'s [=relevant global object=]'s [=associated Document=]'s [=Document/post-prerendering activation steps list=].
</dl>

Every {{Document}} has an <dfn for="Document">activation start time</dfn>, which is initially a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} with a time value of zero.

<div algorithm="User-agent initiated prerendering">
  [=User agents=] may choose to initiate prerendering without a referrer document, for example as a result of the address bar or other browser user interactions.

  To <dfn export>start user-agent initiated prerendering</dfn> given a [=URL=] |startingURL|:

  1. [=Assert=]: |startingURL|'s [=url/scheme=] is an [=HTTP(S) scheme=].

  1. Let |prerenderingTraversable| be the result of [=creating a new top-level traversable=] given null and the empty string.

  1. Set |prerenderingTraversable|'s [=navigable/loading mode=] to "`prerender`".

  1. [=Navigate=] |prerenderingTraversable| to |startingURL| using |prerenderingTraversable|'s [=navigable/active document=].

     <p class="note">We treat this initial navigations as |prerenderingTraversable| navigating itself, which will ensure all relevant security checks pass.

  1. When the user indicates they wish to commit the navigation and create a new user-visible [=top-level traversable=] while doing so (e.g., by pressing <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> after typing in the address bar):

    1. Update the user agent's user interface to present |prerenderingTraversable|, e.g., by creating a new tab/window.

    1. [=prerendering traversable/Finalize activation=] for |prerenderingTraversable| given |startingURL|'s [=url/origin=].

  1. Alternately, when they use indicates they wish to commit the navigation into an existing [=top-level traversable=] |predecessorTraversable| (e.g., by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> after typing in the address bar):

    1. [=prerendering traversable/Activate=] |prerenderingTraversable| in place of |predecessorTraversable| given "`push`".

  <p class="note">The user might never indicate such a commitment, or might take long enough to do so that the user agent needs to reclaim the resources used by the prerender for some more immediate task. In that case the user agent can [=destroy a top-level traversable|destroy=] |prerenderingTraversable|.
</div>

<div>
  To <dfn export>start referrer-initiated prerendering</dfn> given a [=URL=] |startingURL|, a {{Document}} |referrerDoc|, and a [=referrer policy=] |referrerPolicy|:

  1. [=Assert=]: |startingURL|'s [=url/scheme=] is an [=HTTP(S) scheme=].

  1. If |referrerDoc|'s [=node navigable=] is not a [=top-level traversable=], then return.

     <p class="note">Currently, prerendering from inside a [=child navigable=] is not specified or implemented. Doing so would involve tricky considerations around how the prerendered navigable appears in the navigable tree.

  1. If |referrerDoc|'s [=Document/browsing context=] is an [=auxiliary browsing context=], then return.

     <p class="note">This avoids having to deal with any potential opener relationship between the prerendering traversable and |referrerDoc|'s [=Document/browsing context=]'s [=opener browsing context=].

  1. If |referrerDoc|'s [=Document/origin=] is not [=/same site=] with |startingURL|'s [=url/origin=], then return.

     <p class="note">Currently, cross-site prerendering is not specified or implemented, although we have various ideas about how it could work in this repository's explainers.

  1. If |referrerDoc|'s [=Document/prerendering traversables map=][|startingURL|] [=map/exists=], then return.

  1. Let |prerenderingTraversable| be the result of [=creating a new top-level traversable=].

  1. Set |prerenderingTraversable|'s [=navigable/loading mode=] to "`prerender`".

  1. Set |referrerDoc|'s [=Document/prerendering traversables map=][|startingURL|] to |prerenderingTraversable|.

  1. Set |prerenderingTraversable|'s [=prerendering traversable/remove from referrer=] to be an algorithm which [=map/removes=] |referrerDoc|[|startingURL|].

     <p class="note">As with all [=top-level traversables=], the [=prerendering traversable=] can be [=destroy a top-level traversable|destroyed=] for any reason, for example if it becomes unresponsive, performs a restricted operation, or if the user agent believes prerendering takes too many resources.

  1. [=Navigate=] |prerenderingTraversable| to |startingURL| using |referrerDoc|, with <i>[=navigate/referrerPolicy=]</i> set to |referrerPolicy|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn for="prerendering traversable">activate</dfn> a [=prerendering traversable=] |successorTraversable| in place of a [=top-level traversable=] |predecessorTraversable| given a [=history handling behavior=] |historyHandling| and an optional [=navigation ID=] |navigationId|:

  1. [=Assert=]: |successorTraversable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/is initial about:blank=] is false.

  1. If |navigationId| is not given, then let |navigationId| be the result of [=generating a random UUID=].

  1. Let |referrerOrigin| be |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/origin=].

  1. Set |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/ongoing navigation=] to |navigationId|.

     <p class="note">This will have the effect of aborting any other ongoing navigations of |predecessorTraversable|.

  1. [=In parallel=], run these steps:

    1. Let |unloadPromptCanceled| be the result of [=checking if unloading is user-canceled=] for |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/inclusive descendant navigables=].

    1. If |unloadPromptCanceled| is true, or |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/ongoing navigation=] is no longer |navigationId|, then abort these steps.

    1. [=Queue a global task=] on the [=navigation and traversal task source=] given |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/active window=] to [=Document/abort=] |predecessorTraversable|'s [=navigable/active document=].

    1. [=traversable navigable/Append session history traversal steps=] to |predecessorTraversable| to perform the following steps:

      1. [=Assert=]: |successorTraversable|'s [=traversable navigable/current session history step=] is 0.

      1. [=Assert=]: |successorTraversable|'s [=traversable navigable/session history entries=]'s [=list/size=] is 1.

      1. Let |successorEntry| be |successorTraversable|'s [=traversable navigable/session history entries=][0].

      1. [=list/Remove=] |successorEntry| from |successorTraversable|'s [=traversable navigable/session history entries=].

        <p class="note">At this point, |successorTraversable| is empty and can be unobservably destroyed. (As long as the implementation takes care to keep |successorEntry|, including its [=session history entry/document=] and that {{Document}}'s [=Document/browsing context=], alive for the next step.)

      1. [=Finalize a cross-document navigation=] given |predecessorTraversable|, |historyHandling|, and |successorEntry|.

        <p class="note">Because we have moved the entire [=session history entry=], including the contained [=session history entry/document=]'s [=Document/browsing context=], this means traversing across the associated history entries will cause a browsing context group switch, similar to what happens with the [:Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:] header. Importantly, this will sever any opener relationships, in the same way as COOP. Such traversal includes both the actual activation process here, where we make |successorEntry| active, but also e.g. the user pressing the back button (or the page using `history.back()`) after activation, which will switch in the other direction.

      1. Update the user agent's user interface to reflect this change, e.g., by updating the tab/window contents and the browser chrome.

      1. [=prerendering traversable/Finalize activation=] for |successorTraversable| given |referrerOrigin|.

      1. <p class="XXX">Perhaps we should do something with WebDriver BiDi here? See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver-bidi/issues/321">w3c/webdriver-bidi#321</a>. Right now the pre-[=in parallel=] part of the [=navigate=] algorithm will send [=WebDriver BiDi navigation started=] as if it were a normal navigation, but then nothing will happen to indicate the navigation finishes.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  To <dfn for="prerendering traversable">finalize activation</dfn> of a top-level traversable |traversable| given an [=origin=] |origin|:

  1. [=list/For each=] |navigable| of |traversable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/inclusive descendant navigables=], [=queue a global task=] on the [=navigation and traversal task source=], given |navigable|'s [=navigable/active window=], to perform the following steps:

    1. [=map/For each=] |origin| → |hintSet| in |navigable|'s [=prerendering navigable/prerender-scoped Accept-CH cache=]:

      1. [=map/Set=] [=Accept-CH cache=][|origin|] to |hintSet|.

    1. Let |doc| be |navigable|'s [=navigable/active document=].

    1. <p class="XXX">We should really propagate the loading mode change here, in the posted task. This is where implementations would update what is returned by {{Document/prerendering|document.prerendering}}. However, right now it lives on the traversable, so it gets magically updated when we move over the session history entry. Probably we need to move it to the {{Document}}.

    1. If |doc|'s [=Document/origin=] is the same as |origin|, then set |doc|'s [=Document/activation start time=] to the [=current high resolution time=] for |doc|'s [=relevant global object=].

    1. [=Fire an event=] named {{Document/prerenderingchange}} at |doc|.

    1. [=list/For each=] |steps| in |doc|'s [=Document/post-prerendering activation steps list=]:

      1. Run |steps|.

          <p class="note">These steps might return something, like a {{Promise}}. That is just an artifact of how the spec is modified; such return values can always be ignored.

      1. Assert: running |steps| did not throw an exception.

      <p class="note">The order here is observable for {{Document}}s that share an [=event loop=], but not for those in separate event loops.
</div>

<div algorithm>
  A [=prerendering traversable=] has an associated <dfn for="prerendering traversable">remove from referrer</dfn>, which is null or an algorithm with no arguments, initially set to null.

  To ensure that the references for a [=prerendering traversable=] are cleared once it is [=destroy a top-level traversable|destroyed=], modify [=destroy a top-level traversable=] by appending the following step:

  1. If |traversable| is a [=prerendering traversable=] and |traversable|'s [=prerendering traversable/remove from referrer=] is not null, then call |traversable|'s [=prerendering traversable/remove from referrer=].

<h3 id="creating-navigables-patch">Modifications to creating navigables</h3>

<div algorithm="create a new nested navigable patch">
  To ensure that any [=child navigables=] inherit their [=navigable/parent=]'s [=navigable/loading mode=], modify [=create a new nested navigable=] by appending the following step:

  1. If any of the following conditions hold:

      * |navigable| is not a [=top-level traversable=];
      * |navigable| is a [=prerendering traversable=];
      * |navigable| is a [fenced frame](https://github.com/shivanigithub/fenced-frame);
         <p class="issue">The concept of a fenced frame navigable is not yet defined but we need to link to it once it exists.</p>
      * |cspNavigationType| is not "`other`"; or

  1. Return |navigable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/prerendering traversables map=][|url|], if it [=map/exists=]; otherwise return null.

Patch the [=navigate=] algorithm to allow the [=prerendering traversable/activate|activation=] of a [=prerendering traversable=] in place of a normal navigation as follows:

<div algorithm="navigate activate patch">
  In [=navigate=], insert the following steps as the first ones after we go [=in parallel=]:

  1. Let |matchingPrerenderedNavigable| be the result of [=getting the matching prerendering navigable=] given |navigable|, <var ignore>url</var>, <var ignore>cspNavigationType</var>, and <var ignore>documentResource</var>.

  1. If |matchingPrerenderedNavigable| is not null, then:

    1. Wait until either |matchingPrerenderedNavigable|'s [=navigable/active document=]'s [=Document/is initial about:blank=] is false, or |matchingPrerenderedNavigable| is [=destroy a top-level traversable|destroyed=].

    1. If |matchingPrerenderedNavigable| was not destroyed, then:

      1. [=prerendering traversable/Activate=] |matchingPrerenderedNavigable| in place of |navigable| given <var ignore>historyHandling</var> and <var ignore>navigationId</var>.

      1. Abort these steps.

<h3 id="navigate-fetch-patch">Navigation fetch changes</h3>

<div algorithm="create navigation params by fetching patch">
  In [=create navigation params by fetching=], add the following step near the top of the algorithm:

  1. Let |initiatorOrigin| be <var ignore>entry</var>'s [=session history entry/document state=]'s [=document state/initiator origin=].

  Append the following steps after the first sub-step under "While true:":

  1. If |navigable| is a [=prerendering navigable=] and <var ignore>currentURL</var>'s [=url/origin=] is not [=/same site=] with |initiatorOrigin|, then:

    1. If |navigable| is a [=top-level traversable=], then return null.

    1. Otherwise, the user agent must wait to continue this algorithm until |navigable|'s [=navigable/loading mode=] becomes "`normal`". At any point during this wait (including immediately), it may instead choose to [=destroy a top-level traversable|destroy=] |navigable|'s [=top-level traversable=] and return null from this algorithm.

  Append the following steps toward the end of the algorithm, after the steps which check <var ignore>locationURL</var>:

  1. If |navigable| is a [=prerendering navigable=], and <var ignore>responseOrigin</var> is not [=same origin=] with |initiatorOrigin|, then:

    1. Let |loadingModes| be the result of [=getting the supported loading modes=] for <var ignore>response</var>.

    1. If |loadingModes| does not [=list/contain=] \`<code><a for="Supports-Loading-Mode">credentialed-prerender</a></code>\`, then return null.

       <p class="note">In the future we could possibly also allow the `uncredentialed-prerender` token to work here. However, since that is primarily intended for the cross site case, which isn't specified or implemented yet, we don't want to encourage its use in the wild, so for now we specify that prerendering fails if only the `uncredentialed-prerender` token is found.

<div algorithm="attempt to populate the history entry's document patch">
  In [=attempt to populate the history entry's document=], append the following after the steps which establish the value of |failure|, but before the other steps which act on it:

  1. If |navigable| is a [=prerendering navigable=], and any of the following hold:

      * |failure| is true;
      * |navigationParams|'s [=navigation params/request=] is null;

We need to ensure that the [=Accept-CH cache=], which is owned by user agent as a global storage, is not modified while prerendering, but is properly updated after activation. The following modifications ensure this.

Each [=prerendering navigable=] has a <dfn for="prerendering navigable">prerender-scoped Accept-CH cache</dfn>, which is an [=ordered map=] of [=origin=] to [=client hints sets=].

This stores which client hints each origin has opted into receiving, until it can be copied to the global [=Accept-CH cache=] when [=prerendering traversable/finalize activation|activation is finalized=].

<h2 id="supports-loading-mode">The \`<dfn export http-header><code>Supports-Loading-Mode</code></dfn>\` HTTP response header</h2>

<em>The following section would be added as a sub-section of [[HTML]]'s <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsers">Loading web pages</a> section.</em>

In some cases, cross-origin web pages might not be prepared to be loaded in a novel context. To allow them to opt in to being loaded in such ways, the \`<a http-header><code>Supports-Loading-Mode</code></a>\` HTTP response header can be used. This header is a [=structured header=]; if present its value must be one or more of the [=structured header/tokens=] listed below.

<p class="note">The parsing is actually done as a [=structured header/list=] of [=structured header/tokens=], and unknown tokens will be ignored.

The \`<code><dfn export for="Supports-Loading-Mode">credentialed-prerender</dfn></code>\` token indicates that the response can be used to create a [=prerendering navigable=], despite the prerendering being initiated by a cross-origin same-site referrer. Without this opt-in, such prerenders will fail, as outlined in [[#navigate-fetch-patch]].

The \`<code><dfn export for="Supports-Loading-Mode">uncredentialed-prefetch</dfn></code>\` token indicates that the response is suitable to use even if a top-level navigation to this URL would ordinarily send [=credentials=] such as cookies. For instance, the response may be identical or it may be semantically equivalent (e.g., an HTML resource containing script which can update the document after navigation, when local user state is available).

To <dfn export>get the supported loading modes</dfn> for a [=response=] |response|:

1. If |response| is a [=network error=], then return an empty list.

1. Let |slmHeader| be the result of [=header list/getting a structured field value=] given \`<a http-header><code>Supports-Loading-Mode</code></a>\` and "`list`" from |response|'s [=response/header list=].

1. Return a [=list=] containing all elements of |slmHeader| that are [=structured header/tokens=].

<h2 id="nonsense-behaviors">Preventing nonsensical behaviors</h2>

Some behaviors might make sense in most [=navigables=], but do not make sense in [=prerendering navigables=]. This section enumerates specification patches to enforce such restrictions.

<h3 id="patch-window-apis">APIs for creating and navigating browsing contexts by name</h3>

Modify the definition of <a spec=HTML>script-closable</a> to prevent window closing while in a [=prerendering navigable=]:

* it is a [=top-level traversable=] <ins>that is not a [=prerendering traversable=]</ins> and whose [=traversable navigable/session history entries=]'s [=list/size=] is 1.

<h2 id="intrusive-behaviors">Preventing intrusive behaviors</h2>

Various behaviors are disallowed in [=prerendering navigables=] because they would be intrusive to the user, since the prerendered content is not being actively interacted with.

<h3 id="delay-async-apis">Delaying async API results</h3>

Many specifications need to be patched so that, if a given algorithm invoked in a [=prerendering navigable=], most of its work is deferred until the navigable's [=navigable/top-level traversable=] is [=prerendering traversable/activated=]. This is tricky to do uniformly, as many of these specifications do not have great hygeine around <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-for-spec-authors">using the event loop</a>. Nevertheless, the following sections give our best attempt.

<h4 id="delay-while-prerendering">The {{[DelayWhilePrerendering]}} extended attribute</h4>

To abstract away some of the boilerplate involved in delaying the action of asynchronous methods until [=prerendering traversable/activate|activation=], we introduce the <dfn extended-attribute>[DelayWhilePrerendering]</dfn> Web IDL extended attribute. It indicates that when a given method is called in a [=prerendering navigable=], it will immediately return a pending promise and do nothing else. Only upon activation will the usual method steps take place, with their result being used to resolve or reject the previously-returned promise.

The {{[DelayWhilePrerendering]}} extended attribute must take no arguments, and must only appear on a <a lt="regular operation" spec="WEBIDL">regular</a> or <a spec="WEBIDL">static operation</a> whose <a spec="WEBIDL">return type</a> is a <a spec="WEBIDL">promise type</a> or {{undefined}}, and whose <a spec="WEBIDL">exposure set</a> contains only {{Window}}.

<div algorithm="DelayWhilePrerendering method steps">
  The method steps for any operation annotated with the {{[DelayWhilePrerendering]}} extended attribute are replaced with the following:

  1. Let |realm| be the [=current realm=].
  1. If the operation in question is a <a spec="WEBIDL">regular operation</a>, then set |realm| to the [=relevant realm=] of [=this=].
  1. If |realm|'s [=realm/global object=]'s [=Window/navigable=] is a [=prerendering navigable=], then:
    1. Let |promise| be [=a new promise=], created in |realm|.
    1. Append the following steps to [=this=]'s [=platform object/post-prerendering activation steps list=]:
      1. Let |result| be the result of running the originally-specified steps for this operation, with the same [=this=] and arguments.
      1. [=Resolve=] |promise| with |result|.
    1. If this operation's <a spec="WEBIDL">return type</a> is a <a spec="WEBIDL">promise type</a>, then return |promise|.
  1. Otherwise, return the result of running the originally-specified steps for this operation, with the same [=this=] and arguments.

<p class="note">This allows prerendered page to take advantage of existing service workers, but not have any effect on the state of service worker registrations.</p>

<div algorithm="Geolocation watchPosition patch">
  Modify the {{Geolocation/watchPosition()}} method steps by prepending the following step:

  1. If [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=]'s [=Window/navigable=] is a [=prerendering navigable=], then:

    1. Let |watchId| be an [=implementation-defined=] {{unsigned long}}, and note it as a <dfn>post-prerendering activation geolocation watch process ID</dfn>.

    1. Append the following steps to [=this=]'s [=platform object/post-prerendering activation steps list=], with the modification that the |watchId| generated must use |watchId| as its ID, and return |watchId|.
</div>

<div algorithm="Geolocation clearWatch patch">

     <p class="note">This allows implementations to avoid looking up the actual permission state, which might not be synchronously accessible especially in the case of [=prerendering navigables=]. Web developers can then call {{Notification/requestPermission()|Notification.requestPermission()}}, which per the above modifications will only actually do anything after activation. At that time we might discover that the permission is "`granted`" or "`denied`", so the browser might not actually ask the user like would normally be the case with "`default`". But that's OK: it's not observable to web developer code.</p>

  1. Otherwise, <a spec="NOTIFICATIONS">get the notifications permission state</a> and return it.

<h4 id="patch-midi">Web MIDI API</h4>

Add {{[DelayWhilePrerendering]}} to {{Navigator/requestMIDIAccess()}}.

<p class="note">The other interesting method, {{IdleDetector/requestPermission()|IdleDetector.requestPermission()}}, is gated on [=transient activation=]. However, even if permission was previously granted for the origin in question, we delay starting any idle detectors while prerendering.

<h4 id="patch-generic-sensor">Generic Sensor API</h4>

<div algorithm="Sensor start patch">
  Modify the {{Sensor/start()}} method steps by inserting the following steps after the state is set to "`activating`":

  1. If [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=]'s [=Window/navigable=] is a [=prerendering navigable=], then append the following steps to [=this=]'s [=platform object/post-prerendering activation steps list=] and return.
  1. If [=this=].{{Sensor/[[state]]}} is "`idle`", then return.

Some APIs do not need modifications because they will automatically fail or no-op without a property that a [=prerendering navigable=], its [=navigable/active window=], or its [=navigable/active document=] will never have. These properties include:
- [=transient activation=] or [=sticky activation=]
