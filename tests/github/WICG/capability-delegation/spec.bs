# Introduction # {#intro}

*This section is non-normative.*

This specification defines a mechanism through which a script can delegate its
ability to call a restricted API to another [=browsing context=] it trusts.  The
focus here is a dynamic delegation mechanism that exposes the delegated
capability to the target [=browsing context=] in a time-constrained manner.


## What is capability delegation? ## {#what-is-capability-delegation}

Many capabilities in the Web are usable from JS in restricted manners.  For
example:
- Most browsers allow popups (through {{Window/open(url, target,
    features)|Window.open()}} only if the user has either interacted with the
    page recently or allowed the browser to open popups from the page's origin.

- A sandboxed [[html#the-iframe-element|iframe]] cannot make itself full-screen
    (though {{Element/requestFullscreen()}} without a specific sandbox attribute
    or a user interaction within the frame.

Capability delegation means allowing a frame to dynamically relinquish its
ability to call a restricted API and transfer the ability to another (sub)frame
it can trust.  The word "dynamic" here means the effect of the delegation lasts
for a limited time as defined by the capability being delegated.  This is
different from static (load-time) exposure of a capability to a [=browsing
context=] through [[html#the-iframe-element|iframe]] {{HTMLIFrameElement/allow}}
attribute where the capability becomes exposed to a subframe in a
time-unconstrained manner.


## Initiating a delegation vs using a capability ## {#initiate-vs-use}

Capability delegation needs two distinct steps to be effective.  The first step
is "initiation" where one [=browsing context=] notifies another [=browsing
context=] about a specific capability being delegated.  After initiation, the
second (i.e. the receiver) [=browsing context=] would "use" the delegated
capability, which typically means calling a capability-defined method.  While
the capability delegation specification here does not define the API interface
used in the second step, it redefines the API's internal behavior.

Because of this, this specification consists of two distinct parts: defining an
API for the initiation step, and then defining delegated behavior for one
specific "user" API.  For the second part, this specification focuses on
behavior changes needed in [[payment-request|Payment Request API]], which would
serve as a guide for similar changes in any other APIs that would utilize
capability delegation in future.


## Transient availability ## {#transient-availability}

Both the steps mentioned above are time-constrained in nature:

1. The initiation step is [[html#user-activation-gated-apis|activation
    consuming]], so the step is allowed only after a recent user activation.
    Moreover, the consumption of user activation here guarantees that the
    delegation mechanism can't be used more than once per user activation.  This
    prevents malicous uses of capability delegation, like repeated delegation
    attempts to multiple frames to effectively bypass the user activation
    restriction for the delegated API.

2. After a successful completion of the initiation step, the delegated API
    becomes available for use in the target [=browsing context=] for a few
    seconds only.  The exact time limit here depends on how a delegated API
    defines the delegated behavior in its own specification.  For an API that
    does not define its own time limit, the default limit will be the same as
    [user activation
    expiry](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-expiry).


# Examples # {#examples}

<div class="example" id="example-payment-request">
  When a site wants to delegate the capability to call [[payment-request]]
  {{PaymentRequest/show()}} from a subframe after a mouse click, it will
  [[html#posting-messages|post a message]] to the subframe with an additional
  option to specify the delegated capability:

  ```javascript
  window.onclick = () => {
    targetWindow.postMessage('a_message', {delegate: "payment"});
  };
  ```

  Upon receiving the message, the subframe would be able to use
  {{PaymentRequest/show()}} even though the frame hasn't received a user
  activation:

  ```javascript
  window.onmessage = () => {
    const payRequest = new PaymentRequest(...);
    const payResponse = await payRequest.show();
    ...
  }
  ```
</div>

</section>


# Initiating capability delegation # {#initiating-delegation}

When a [=browsing context=] wants to delegate a capability to another [=browsing
context=], it posts a message to the second [=browsing context=] with an extra
{{WindowPostMessageOptions}} called `delegate` specifying the capability.  The
value of this option MUST be a
[[permissions-policy#ascii-serialization|feature-identifier]].  The option MUST
be ignored if the value does not correspond to any [features supported by the
user
agent](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/#supported-features).

<div class="note">
  A list of possible
  [[permissions-policy#ascii-serialization|feature-identifier]] values appears
  [here](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/features.md).
</div>


## Monkey-patch to HTML spec ## {#monkey-patch-to-html-initiating-delegation}

The {{WindowPostMessageOptions}} IDL definition will include an additional field as follows:

```IDL
  DOMString? delegate;
```

In the algorithm for [window post
message](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#window-post-message-steps),
the following step:

> 6. Let <var ignore>transfer</var> be <var>options</var>["transfer"].

will be followed by two additional steps as follows:

7. Let <var>delegate</var> be <var>options</var>["delegate"].

8. If <var>delegate</var> is not null, then:

    1. If the user agent does not support delegating the feature indicated by <var>delegate</var>,
        then throw a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.

    2. If <var ignore="">targetWindow</var>'s [associated
        Document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#concept-document-window)
        is not
        [allowed-to-use](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#allowed-to-use)
        the feature indicated by <var>delegate</var>, then throw a a
        "NotAllowedError" DOMException.

    2. If <var ignore="">targetOrigin</var> is a single U+002A ASTERISK character (*), then throw a
        a "NotAllowedError" DOMException.

        <div class="note">
          The default value of
          [targetOrigin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#dom-windowpostmessageoptions-targetorigin)
          is "/", restricting the message to same-origin targets. The additional requirement to use a string other than "*" means
          that cross-origin messages has to specify the specific origin for which they are intended.
        </div>

    3. Let <var>source</var> be <var ignore="">incumbentSettings</var>'s [=environment settings
        object/global object=].

    4. If <var>source</var> does not have [transient
        activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation),
        then throw a "NotAllowedError" DOMException.

    5. [Consume user
        activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#consume-user-activation)
        in <var>source</var>.


# Tracking delegated capability # {#tracking-delegation}

Capabilities delegated to a [=browsing context=] will be tracked using a map
named {{Window}}.[=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=]. Each time a capability is
delegated to a {{Window}}, an entry will be added in
[=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=] with a key equal to the
[[permissions-policy#ascii-serialization|feature-identifier]] representing the
capability, and a value equal to current {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}.  If the map
already has an entry for the same key, the existing value will be updated to
current {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}.


## Monkey-patch to HTML spec ## {#monkey-patch-to-html-tracking-delegation}

Right before the algorithm for [window post
message](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#window-post-message-steps),
a new paragraph will be inserted, as follow:

> For the purpose of tracking capabilities delegated to a [=browsing context=],
> each {{Window}} has a [=map=] called
> <dfn>DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS</dfn> from
> [[permissions-policy#ascii-serialization|feature-identifier]] to
> {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}.  The map is initialized with an empty map.

In the algorithm for [window post
message](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#window-post-message-steps),
two additional sub-steps will be added to current Step 8.  The first additional
sub-step will be inserted after the following sub-step:

> 8. Queue a global task ...
>     2. Let origin be the serialization of incumbentSettings's origin.

as follows:

8. Queue a global task ... *(unchanged)*

    3. Let <var>delegate</var> be <var>options</var>["delegate"].

The second additional sub-step will be inserted after the following sub-step:

> 8. Queue a global task ...
>     6. Let newPorts be a new frozen array consisting of ...

as follows:

8. Queue a global task ... *(unchanged)*

    7. Let newPorts be a new frozen array consisting of ... *(unchanged except
        for numbering)*

    8. If <var>delegate</var> is not null, AND the user agent supports
        delegating <var>delegate</var>, then set
        [=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=][<var>delegate</var>] to [current
        high resolution
        time](https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dfn-current-high-resolution-time).


# Defining delegated capability behavior # {#defining-delegated-behavior}

Any capability that defines a delegated behavior uses the corresponding entry in
{{Window}}.[=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=] in a manner appropriate for the
capability.  Below is the spec change needed for one particular capability.


## Monkey-patch to Payment Request spec ## {#monkey-patch-to-payment-req}

In the algorithm for {{PaymentRequest/show()}}, the following steps will be
replaced to implement the delegated behavior:

The two steps:

> 2. If the relevant global object of request does not have transient activation:
>     1. Return a promise rejected with a "SecurityError" DOMException.
>
> 3. Consume user activation of the relevant global object.

will be replaced by the following three steps:

2. If the relevant global object of request does not have [transient
    activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation),
    AND the timestamp [=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=]["payment"] in the
    relevant global object is either undefined or
    [expired](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-expiry):
     1. Return a promise rejected with a "SecurityError" DOMException.

3. If the relevant global object of request does not have transient activation,
    then clear the map entry [=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=]["payment"].

4. Otherwise, [consume user
    activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#consume-user-activation)
    of the relevant global object.

## Monkey-patch to Fullscreen spec ## {#monkey-patch-to-fullscreen}

In the algorithm for {{Element/requestFullscreen()}}, the following changes will be
done to implement the delegated behavior:

The last condition in Step 5:

> 5.  If any of the following conditions are false, then set error to true: ...
>      - This’s relevant global object has transient activation or
>         the algorithm is triggered by a user generated orientation change.

will be replaced by:

5.  If any of the following conditions are false, then set error to true: ... *(unchanged)*
     - This’s relevant global object has transient activation, or
        the timestamp [=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=]["fullscreen"] in this's
        relevant global object is neither undefined nor
        [expired](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-expiry), or
        the algorithm is triggered by a user generated orientation change.

Right before the Step 10:

> 10. Let fullscreenElements be an ordered set initially consisting of this.

the following new step will be inserted:

10. If this’s relevant global object does not have transient activation, then clear the map entry
     [=DELEGATED_CAPABILITY_TIMESTAMPS=]["fullscreen"] in this's relevant global object.
11. Let fullscreenElements be an ordered set initially consisting of this. *(unchanged except
     for numbering)*
