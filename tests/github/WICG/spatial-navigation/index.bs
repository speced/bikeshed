This specification is rather long.
To make it easier to read and focus on a particular area,
a few checkboxes are provided below.
Checking them hides part of the specification.

Introduction</h2>

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Historically, most browsers have not offered features to let users move the focus directionally.
Some, such as TV browsers, have enabled users to move the focus using the arrow keys out of necessity,
since no other input mechanism is available on a typical TV remote control.

Others, have enabled different key combinations to control spatial navigation,
such as pressing the <code class=key>Shift</code> key together with arrow keys.

This ability to move around the page directionally is called <dfn lt="spatial navigation | spatialNavigation" export>spatial navigation</dfn>.

<a>Spatial navigation</a> can be useful for a web page built using a grid-like layout,
or other predominantly non linear layouts.
The figure below represents a photo gallery arranged in a grid layout.
If the user presses the <code class=key>Tab</code> key to move focus,
they need to press the key many times to reach the desired element.
Also, the grid layout may arrange the layout of elements independently of their source order.
Therefore sequential navigation using the <code class=key>Tab</code> key makes focus navigation unpredictable.
In contrast, <a>spatial navigation</a> moves the focus among focusable elements
depending on their position
allowing it to address problems encountered with sequential navigation.

<figure>
    <img alt="When elements are laid out in a grid pattern, spatial navigation makes it much easier to predict and control where focus should move to." src="images/spatnav-enable.png" style="width: 500px;"/>
    <figcaption>Application using a grid-like layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

While arrow keys are naturally suited to control spatial navigation,
no previous specification describes how that should work,
or how it may be controlled.
<span class=api>This specification introduces a processing model for spatial navigation,
as well as APIs
enabling authors to control and override how spatial navigation works.</span>

Note: Some aspects of this specification, such as the JavaScript Events and APIs
could also be extended to sequential navigation,
in order to make sure that keyboard navigation in general
has a consistent and well defined model.

Note: As a general principle,
keyboard navigation,
and spatial navigation in particular,
should be possible to use and control without JavaScript<span class=cssapi>,
and declarative solutions are therefore preferred.
Since spatial navigation depends on layout,
that means CSS is typically the right mechanism to define
spatial navigation related controls</span>.
<span class=api>However, in the spirit of the <a href="https://github.com/extensibleweb/manifesto">Extensible Web Manifesto</a> [[EXTENSIBLE]],
we feel it is important to provide the right JavaScript primitives
to let authors experiment and explore the problem space.
More declarative features may be added later,
based on feedback and experience acquired through such JavaScript usage.</span>

Note: A few features are marked <dfn noexport>at-risk</dfn>.
The editors of this specification believe
they represent an important part of the user or author experience
of the features defined in specification.
At the same time, the core functionality of this specification
can be implemented without implementing these
so it seems possible that implementors may choose to down-prioritize them
to reduce the scope of a first implementation.
While it is hoped that these features will be implemented as well,
they are marked at-risk in recognition that they might not be at first.

<div class=verbose>
<h2 id=overview class=non-normative>
Overview</h2>

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Using a UA-defined mechanism
(typically arrow keys, possibly in combination with modifier keys like <code class=key>Shift</code> or <code class=key>Control</code>),
the user may ask the User Agent to navigate in a particular direction.
This will either
move the focus from its current location to a new focusable item in the direction requested,
or scroll if there is no appropriate item.

More specifically,
the User Agent will first search for visible and focusable items
in the direction indicated
within the current <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>
(<span class=cssapi>by default </span>the root element, scrollable elements, and iframes<span class=cssapi>,
but other elements can be made into <a>spatial navigation focus containers</a>
using the 'spatial-navigation-contain' property</span>).

If it finds any, it will pick the best one for that direction,
and move the focus there.

If it does not, it will scroll the <a>spatial navigation focus container</a> in the requested direction
instead of moving focus.
Doing so may uncover focusable elements
which would then be eligible targets to move the focus to
next time spatial navigation in the same direction is requested.

If the <a>spatial navigation focus container</a> cannot be scrolled,
either because it is not a scrollable element
or because it is already scrolled to the maximum in that direction,
the User Agent will select the next <a>spatial navigation focus container</a> up the ancestry chain,
and repeat the process of
looking for eligible focus targets,
selecting the best one if there's any,
scrolling if not,
going up the ancestry chain if it cannot scroll,
until it has either moved focus,
scrolled,
or reached the root.

Note: As a consequnce of this processing model,
the elements that are reachable by sequential navigation
and by spatial navigation are almost the same:
elements that are currently outside of the viewport of a scrollable element
can only be reached once they have been scrolled into view,
and those that cannot be scrolled into view,
for instance because they are placed at a negative offset,
are out of reach.

<div class=api>
At key points during this search for the appropriate response to the spatial navigation request,
the User Agent will fire events.
These enable authors to prevent the upcoming action
(by calling {{preventDefault()}}),
and if desired to provide an alternate action,
such as using calling the {{HTMLOrSVGElement/focus()}} method on a different
element of the author's choosing.

To help authors write such alternate actions,
and as part of exposing underlying platform primitives as per the <a href="https://github.com/extensibleweb/manifesto">Extensible Web</a> principles,
this specification also defines JavaScript APIs
that expose key constructs of the underlying model.


See [[#events-nav-type]] for details about the various events,
and [[#js-api]] for details about the JavaScript API.
</div>

<div class='example'>
    In this example, shows how a series of focusable elements
    arranged in a scrollable element
    would be navigated when using spatial navigation.
    For the sake of keeping the description simple,
    this example assumes a UA where spatial navigation is triggered using arrow keys.

    <figure>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-visible-1.png" style="width: 200px;"/>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-visible-2.png" style="width: 200px;"/>
        <figcaption>Moving focus to the visible element in the <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    On the left of figure 2, "Box 2" is focused.
    Pressing the <code class=key>ArrowDown</code> key moves focus to
    "Box 3" without scrolling because "Box 3" is visible in the <a>scrollport</a> of the <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>.

    <figure>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-invisible-1.png" style="width: 160px;"/>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-invisible-2.png" style="width: 160px;"/>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-invisible-3.png" style="width: 160px;"/>
        <img alt="" src="images/spatnav-scroll-invisible-4.png" style="width: 160px;"/>
        <figcaption>Moving focus to the hidden element in the <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    On the first of figure 3, under "Box 3", there isn't any visible element in the <a>scrollport</a>.
    Therefore, the effect of pressing the <code class=key>ArrowDown</code> is to scroll down, as shown in the second.
    The next press of the <code class=key>ArrowDown</code> key makes "Box 4" come into the <a>scrollport</a>,
    and the focus will move to it when there is additional pressing the <code class=key>ArrowDown</code>, as the fourth.

    This example uses the markup as follows:
    <pre class="lang-css">
        #scroller {
            width: 700px;
            height: 700px;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            overflow-y: auto;
        }

        .box {
            width: 150px;
            height: 110px;
            background-color: blue;
        }

        .box:focus {
            background-color: red;
        }
    </pre>

    <pre class="lang-html">
        &lt;div id="scroller">
            &lt;div class="box" tabindex="0">Box 1&lt;/div>
            &lt;div class="box" tabindex="0">Box 2&lt;/div>
            &lt;div class="box" tabindex="0">Box 3&lt;/div>
            &lt;div class="box" tabindex="0">Box 4&lt;/div>
        &lt;/div>
    </pre>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id=triggering>
Triggering Spatial Navigation</h2>

When the user triggers spatial navigation in a given direction,
the User Agent must run the <a>spatial navigation steps</a> in that direction.

This specification does not define what UI mechanism User Agents should offer to users to trigger spatial navigation.
This intentionally left for User Agents to decide.

<div class=note>Note:
    It is expected that User Agents on devices with limited input capabilities,
    such as TVs operated with a remote control,
    or devices operated with a game controller,
    will use spatial navigation as their primary or exclusive navigation mechanism.
</div>

Although it is possible for User Agents
to implement the processing model and APIs defined by the specification
without giving any direct means to the user to trigger spatial navigation themselves,
this specification recommends not to do so:
User Agents should offer a means for users to trigger spatial navigation directly,
without having to use the APIs.

Note: Conversely, authors should assume that spatial navigation may be triggered
by the UA in response to user actions
even if the author has not invoked any of the APIs.

Regardless of the actual mechanism chosen to trigger spatial navigation,
the following requirements apply:
* If the mechanism the user must use to trigger spatial navigation
    would normally fire a {{UIEvent}},
    then that event must be fired prior to running the <a>spatial navigation steps</a>
    and these steps must not be run if that event's <a>canceled flag</a>
    gets set.

    <div class=example>
        Gaming devices may trigger spatial navigation based on pressing the D-pad.
        This would result in firing a <a event>keydown</a> event
        with the key set to one of
        <code class=key>ArrowDown</code>,
        <code class=key>ArrowLeft</code>,
        <code class=key>ArrowRight</code>,
        or <code class=key>ArrowUp</code>,
        followed if not canceled by running the <a>spatial navigation steps</a><span class=api>,
        including firing the relevant {{NavigationEvent}}s</span>.

        A User Agent on a desktop computer that triggers spatial navigation
        using the arrow keys of the keyboard
        would follow the same sequence.
    </div>
* If the mechanism the user must use to trigger spatial navigation
    would in some contexts trigger other actions,
    the User Agent should in these contexts
    give priority to these other actions
    and execute them instead of spatial navigation.
    It must not trigger both.

    <div class=example>
        In a User Agent that triggers spatial navigation
        using the arrow keys without modifier keys,
        and uses these same arrow keys to move
        the text insertion caret when an editable element is focused,
        the arrow keys should by default to moving the caret.
        Spatial navigation would only be triggered by the arrow keys
        when the focused element is not editable,
        or when it is editable but the caret cannot move any further in the requested direction.
    </div>

    An exception is made for scrolling:
    since spatial navigation itself handles scrolling
    (in addition to moving the focus)
    User Agents should not offer the same mechanism to trigger both spatial navigation
    and a scrolling behavior separate from spatial navigation.
    UAs may however, offer a way for the user to switch between different modes,
    or offer both based on different UI mechanism.

    <div class=example>
        A User Agent may have a setting to let the user choose
        between using the arrow keys without modifier keys
        for spatial navigation or for scrolling.
        Another one may offer scrolling on arrow keys without modifiers,
        and spatial navigation on arrow keys when pressed together
        with the <code class=key>Shift</code> key,
        or on the <code class=key>W</code> <code class=key>A</code> <code class=key>S</code> <code class=key>D</code> keys.
        Offering only spatial navigation or only scrolling
        as responses to pressing arrow keys would also be possibilities.
    </div>


<div class=api>
<h2 id="js-api">
JavaScript API</h2>

<h3 id=high-level-api>
Triggering Navigation Programmatically</h3>

The {{Window/navigate()}} method enables the author to trigger spatial navigation programatically,
as if the user had done so manually
(for instance, by pressing the arrow keys in a browser where that is the way to trigger spatial navigation).

Note: As this triggers the same processing model as a manual navigation,
all the same results should be expected:
the same chain of events will be fired and
the same element will be scrolled or focused.

Note: Authors can use this to trigger spatial navigation
based on a different UI mechanism than the one assigned by the UA,
such as mapping to different keys,
or triggering spatial navigation from a clickable on-screen directional pad.
or in reaction to other events than UI ones.
It could also be used when an author wants to interrupt navigation to do some asynchronous operation
(e.g. load more content in an infinite scroller) then resume where they cancelled.

Note: This API is also useful for testing purposes,
as there is no other way to trigger spatial navigation
that does not depend on vendor specific UI conventions.

<pre class="idl">
enum SpatialNavigationDirection {
    "up",
    "down",
    "left",
    "right",
};

partial interface Window {
    void navigate(SpatialNavigationDirection dir);
};
</pre>

<div algorithm="windowNavigate steps">
The {{Window/navigate()}} method must follow these steps:

If <var>dir</var> is <code>"up"</code>, <code>"down"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, or <code>"right"</code>,
run the <a>spatial navigation steps</a> in direction <var>dir</var>.

</div>

<h3 id=low-level-api>
Low level APIs</h3>

Note: These APIs are designed to be low level constructs following the processing model closely.
As such, they should be easy to use by authors who want to extend or override the way spatial navigation works.

<pre class="idl">
enum FocusableAreaSearchMode {
    "visible",
    "all"
};

dictionary FocusableAreasOptions {
    FocusableAreaSearchMode mode;
};

dictionary SpatialNavigationSearchOptions {
    required SpatialNavigationDirection dir;
    sequence&lt;Node>? candidates;
    Node? container;
};

partial interface Element {
    Node getSpatialNavigationContainer();
    sequence&lt;Node> focusableAreas(optional FocusableAreasOptions arg);
    Node? spatialNavigationSearch(SpatialNavigationSearchOptions arg);
};
</pre>

Note: The way the direction is expressed allows us to expand to more than 4-way navigation
later of if this is found necessary.
More directional keywords or a numerical angle could be added.

Note: the {{focusableAreas()}} and {{getSpatialNavigationContainer()}} methods are <a>at-risk</a>.

<div algorithm="getSpatialNavigationContainer steps">
The {{Element/getSpatialNavigationContainer()}} method must follow these steps:
1. Return the element if it is a <a>spatial navigation container</a>,
    or the nearest ancestor of the element that is a <a>spatial navigation container</a>,
    or the <a>document</a> if the nearest <a>spatial navigation container</a> is the viewport.

</div>

<div algorithm="focusableAreas steps">
The {{Element/focusableAreas()}} method must follow these steps:
1. Let <var>v</var> be <code>false</code>
    if the argument's {{FocusableAreasOptions/mode}} attribute if present and equal to <code>"all"</code>,
    or <code>true</code> otherwise.
4. Let <var>areas</var> be the result of <a>finding focusable areas</a> within the element with the visibleOnly argument set to <var>v</var>
5. Let <var>anchors</var> be a <a for=list>clone</a> of <var>areas</var>,
    with every <a>focusable area</a> which is not itself a <a>Node</a> replaced with its <a>DOM anchor</a>.
6. Return <var>anchors</var>

</div>

<div algorithm="spatialNavigationSearch steps">
The {{Element/spatialNavigationSearch()}} method must follow these steps:
1. Let <var>d</var> be the argument's {{SpatialNavigationSearchOptions/dir}} attribute
2. If the argument's {{SpatialNavigationSearchOptions/candidates}} attribute is not <code>null</code>,
    then let <var>areas</var> be that attribute,
    else, let <var>areas</var> be the result of <a>finding focusable areas</a>
    within the argument's {{SpatialNavigationSearchOptions/container}} attribute is not <code>null</code>,
    or the element's nearest <a>spatial navigation container</a> ancestor
4. Return the result of <a>selecting the best candidate</a> within <var>areas</var> in direction <var>d</var> from the element

Note: When neither a container nor a list of candidates is provided,
this only searches through the visible focusable areas of the nearest
<a>spatial navigation container</a> ancestor.
<strong>If none are found, this does not climb further up the ancestry chain,
and the result will be <code>null</code>.</strong>
</div>


<div class=example id=focus-only>
    The following code changes the behavior of spatial navigation
    from scrolling when there is no focusable element visible,
    to jumping to focusable elements even when they are not visible.

    <pre><code highlight=javascript>
    document.addEventListener("navbeforescroll", function(e) {
        var container = e.relatedTarget;
        var areas = container.focusableAreas({ mode: "all" });

        if (areas.length === 0) { return; }

        e.preventDefault();
        var t = e.target.spatialNavigationSearch({
            dir: e.dir,
            candidates: areas
        });
        t.focus();
    });
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div class=example id=delegation>
    The following code changes the behavior of spatial navigation
    so that when a scroll container would get focused,
    if it has at least one visible focusable descendant,
    the focus is automatically transfered to it.

    <pre><code highlight=javascript>
    document.addEventListener("navbeforefocus", function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        if (e.dir === "forward" || e.dir === "backward") {
            e.dir = "top";
        }

        var t = e.relatedTarget;
        while (t.isSameNode(t.getSpatialNavigationContainer())) {
            var areas = t.focusableAreas();

            if (areas.length === 0) { break; }

            t = t.spatialNavigationSearch({
                dir:  e.dir,
                candidates: areas
            });
        }
        t.focus();
    });
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div class=example id=loop>
    The following code changes the behavior of spatial navigation
    to trap the focus within a spatial navigation container:
    when no further focusable elements can be found in the requested direcition
    and the spatial navigation container cannot be scrolled any futher,
    we loop back to the other side instead of searching outside of it,
    either by focusing or scrolling depending on what is available.

    The focus can still be moved outside by sequential navigation,
    mouse interaction,
    programatic calls to {{focus()}}…

    <pre><code highlight=javascript>
    document.addEventListener("navnotarget", function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        var c = e.relatedTarget;
        var areas = c.focusableAreas({mode: "all"});

        if (areas.length === 0) {
            switch (e.dir) {
                case "down":
                    c.scrollTop = 0;
                    break;
                case "up":
                    c.scrollTop = c.scrollHeight;
                    break;
                case "right":
                    c.scrollLeft = 0;
                    break;
                case "left":
                    c.scrollLeft = c.scrollWidth;
                    break;
            }
        } else {
            var t = c.spatialNavigationSearch({
                dir: e.dir,
                candidates: areas

<h2 id=processing-model>
Processing Model</h2>

<div class=verbose>
The [[#overview]] section gives a high level idea of how spatial navigation works,
to help readers of this specification build a general mental model.
It uses intuitive but imprecise terminology,
and glosses over many details
for the sake of readability.

This section defines the corresponding normative behavior
and aims for as much detail as necessary
to fully define the behavior.
</div>

Issue(19): The following currently does not account
for <a href="https://github.com/WICG/overscroll-behavior">the proposed overscroll-behavior specification</a>.

Issue(21): The following does not take shadow dom into account.


<h3 id=grouping>
Groupings of elements</h3>

While the general model for spatial navigation
is to work from the layout of the document
and the relative position of focusable elements,
the User Agent is required to prioritize finding elements
from a local logical grouping,
only looking for focusable elements outside of the grouping
if a suitable one cannot be found inside it (see [[#nav]] for details).

Such groupings are called <dfn lt="spatial navigation focus container | spatial navigation focus containers | spatial navigation container | spatial navigation containers">spatial navigation focus containers</dfn>.

<span class=cssapi>By default, </span><a>spatial navigation containers</a> are established by:
* The viewport of a <a for="/">browsing context</a>
    (not limited to the <a>top-level browsing context</a>)

* <a>scroll containers</a>

<div class=cssapi>
Additional <a>spatial navigation containers</a> can be created using the 'spatial-navigation-contain' property (see [[#container]]).
</div>

<h3 id=nav>
Navigation</h3>

<figure class="verbose non-normative">
<figcaption>This figure is not normative. It gives an overview of the processing model further defined in this section.</figcaption>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="images/spatnav_processing_model_diagram.svg"></object>
</figure>

There can be a <dfn>spatial navigation starting point</dfn>. It is initially unset.
The user agent may set it when the user indicates that it should be moved.

Note: For example, the user agent could set it to the position of the user's click if the user clicks on the document contents,
and unset when the focus is moved (by spatial navigation or any other means).

If the UA sets both a <a>spatial navigation starting point</a> and a <a>sequential focus navigation starting point</a>,
they must not be set differently.

Issue(23): The focusing steps should probably reset the <a>spatial navigation starting point</a>

<div algorithm="to run the spatial navigation steps">
To run the <dfn>spatial navigation steps</dfn> in <var>direction</var>, do the following:

1. Let <var>startingPoint</var> be the <a>DOM anchor</a> of the <a>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</a>.
2. If the <a>spatial navigation starting point</a> is not <code>null</code>
    and it is inside <var>startingPoint</var>

        let <var>eventTarget</var> be <var>startingPoint</var>
    * else (<a>assert</a>: the starting point is a position)
        let <var>eventTarget</var> be the <a>node</a> which contains <var>startingPoint</var>
4. If <var>eventTarget</var> is the <a>Document</a> or the <a>document element</a>,
        set <var>eventTarget</var> be <a>the body element</a> if it is not <code>null</code>
        or to the <a>document element</a> otherwise.
5. If <var>startingPoint</var> is either a <a>scroll container</a> or the <a>document</a>

<h3 id=heuristics>
Focus Navigation Heuristics</h3>

Note: The following algorithms are inspired from Chrome's implementation
as well as from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WICD/#focus-handling">old WICD Spec</a>.
Implementors who find better approaches or refinements to these approaches are strongly
encouraged to provide feedback and help improve this specification
in order to maximize interoperability.
In particular, divergences in how User Agents <a>find focusable areas</a>
may cause some elements to be focusable in some User Agents but not in others,
which would be bad for users.

All geometrical operations in this section are defined to work on the result of CSS layout,
including all graphical transformations, such as <a>relative positioning</a> or [[CSS-TRANSFORMS-1]].

The <dfn>boundary box</dfn> of an object is defined as follows:
* if the object is a point, the boundary box is that point
* if the object is a [=box=] or [=box fragment=], the boundary box is the <a>border box</a> of that box or fragment.
* if the object is a <a>focusable area</a> which is not an element, the boundary box is the axis-aligned the bounding box of that <a>focusable area</a>

Issue(w3c/csswg-drafts#2324): CSS should have a term for “border box taking into account corner shaping properties like border-radius”.

<div algorithm="to find focusable areas">

To <dfn lt="find focusable areas | finding focusable areas">find focusable areas</dfn> within a containing element <var>C</var>,
with an optional <var>visibleOnly</var> argument that defaults to <code>true</code>,
follow the following steps:

1. Let <var>focusables</var> be the <a spec=infra for="/">set</a> of all the <a>focusable areas</a> whose [=DOM anchor=] are descendants of <var>C</var>.
    In the case of [=boxes=] with several [=box fragments=], each [=box fragment=] is considered separately.
2. The UA should <a spec=infra for=set>remove</a> from <var>focusables</var> items that have a [=DOM anchor=] whose <a element-attr spec=html><code>tabindex</code></a> attribute is set to a negative value.

    Note: This is a "SHOULD" in order to mirror the exclusion of elements with negative tabindex
    from the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a> as defined in [[HTML#the-tabindex-attribute]].
3. If <var>visibleOnly</var> is <code>false</code>,
    return <var>focusables</var>.

    Note: <var>focusables</var> may be empty
4. Let <var>insideArea</var> be
    * the <a>optimal viewing region</a> of <var>C</var> if <var>C</var> is a <a>scroll container</a>,
    * the viewport of C's <a for="/">browsing context</a> if <var>C</var> is a <a>Document</a>,
    * the <a>border box</a> of <var>C</var> otherwise.
5. Let <var>visibles</var> be the subset of items in <var>focusables</var>
    whose <a>boundary box</a>
    is at least partly within <var>insideArea</var>.

    <div class="advisement non-normative">
    Except for elements that are in the currently non visible part of a scroller,
    spatial navigation does not automatically exclude
    elements which cannot be clicked on,
    for example due to being obscured by some other element.
    To avoid breaking assumptions in
    the application logic if a user actually focuses and activates such an element,
    and to avoid confusing users by focusing invisible or apparently unreachable elements,
    authors should use make these elements unreachable to spatial navigation
    using the same best practices as for making elements unreachable to sequential navigation,
    such as using <code>tab-index="-1"</code>
    or the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/inert"><code>inert</code></a> attribute.

6. Return <var>visibles</var>.

2. If <var>candidates</var> contains a single item, return that item
3. Let <var>insideArea</var> be

    * the viewport if <var>starting point</var> is a <a>Document</a>,
    * the <a>border box</a> of <var>starting point</var> otherwise.
4. Let <var>insiders</var> be the subset of <var>candidates</var> items
    whose [=DOM anchor=] are descendants of <var>starting point</var>
    and whose <a>boundary box</a>'s
    * top edge is below the top edge of <var>insideArea</var> if <var>D</var> is <code>down</code>

    * left edge is right of the left edge of <var>insideArea</var> if <var>D</var> is <code>right</code>

    Note: this sub-setting is necessary to avoid going in the opposite direction than the one requested.
5.
    * If <var>insiders</var> is non empty
        1. Let <var>closest subset</var> be the subset of <var>insiders</var> whose <a>boundary box</a>'s

    * Else
        1. Set <var>candidates</var> be the subset of its items
            whose <a>boundary box</a>'s geometric center is within the closed half plane
            whose boundary goes through the geometric center of the <var>starting point</var>
            and is perpendicular to <var>D</var>.
        2. For each <var>candidate</var> in <var>candidates</var>,
            find the points <var>P1</var> inside the <a>boundary box</a> of <var>starting point</var>

        3. Return the item of the <var>candidates</var> set that has the smallest <var>distance</var>.
            If several have the same distance,
            return the first one in document order,
            unless its [=boundary box=] overlaps with the [=boundary box=] of an other item at the same distance,
            and that item is higher in the CSS [=painting order=].
            In that case, return that item instead,
            unless it too is overlapped with another higher item at the same distance, recursively.

Controlling spatial navigation through declarative means</h2>

Creating additional spatial navigation containers: the 'spatial-navigation-contain' property</h3>

<pre class='propdef'>

Value: auto | contain
Initial: auto
Inherited: no
</pre>

<dl dfn-for=spatial-navigation-contain dfn-type=value>
    <dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
    <dd>If the element is a <a>scroll container</a>
        then it establishes a <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>,
        otherwise it does not.

    <dt><dfn>contain</dfn>
    <dd>The element establishes a <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>

Note: In addition, as per [[#grouping]], the viewport of a <a for="/">browsing context</a>
        (not limited to the <a>top-level browsing context</a>)
        also establishes a <a>spatial navigation focus container</a>.

<div class=example>
    The following example shows a simplified TV program schedule or calendar.
    It has a grid of elements representing TV shows or calendar entries,
    and some UI buttons around it.

    In this case, the grid is quite sparse,
    so if the user tries to move down from "Foo",
    focus would be moved to "Next Week",
    as it is objectively closer in the down direction.
    The same is true for going down from "Bar":
    the focus would be moved to "Previous Week".

    Because the elements in the table are semantically related to eachother,
    the author may want to provide a different navigation experience
    giving priority to movements inside the grid once you have focused one of its items.

    Adding <code highlight=css>table { spatial-navigation-contain: contain; }</code> to the stylesheet
    would result it this behavior.
    It would still be possible to move the focus out of the table,
    for example by going right from "Foo".
    Since there is nothing in the grid that is to the right,
    the focus would move to "Next week".

    However, if the user navigates down from "Foo",
    there is something inside the grid,
    so focus will move there without considering things that are outside.

<h2 class=no-num id=scrolling>Appendix A. Scroll extensions</h2>

This section proposes a few extensions to CSS
that should be integrated in upstream specifications,
but are hosted here until then.

<div algorithm>

Issue(w3c/csswg-drafts#2322): Terminology like this should be in [[CSSOM-VIEW-1]], [[CSS-OVERFLOW-3]], [[CSS-SCROLL-SNAP-1]].

An element <var>e</var> <dfn lt="can be manually scrolled | can be scrolled manually | cannot be scrolled manually | cannot be manually scrolled">can be manually scrolled</dfn> in a given direction <var>d</var> if:
* The <a>principal box</a> established by <var>e</var> is a <a>scroll container</a>, and
* if <var>d</var> is <code>up</code> or <code>down</code>, the computed value of the 'overflow-y' property is not ''overflow/hidden'', and
* if <var>d</var> is <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>, the computed value of the 'overflow-x' property is not ''overflow/hidden'', and
* <var>e</var> is not at the <a>scroll boundary</a> in the direction <var>d</var>
* <var>e</var> is not snapped to the last ''mandatory'' snap point in direction <var>d</var>

</div>

<div algorithm="to directionally scroll an element">

Issue(w3c/csswg-drafts#2323): [[CSSOM-VIEW-1]] should probably define

Until then, we roll our own.

To <dfn lt="directionally scroll an element | directionally scroll the element">directionally scroll an element</dfn> <var>e</var> in direction <var>dir</var>:

1. Let <var>d</var> be a User Agent defined distance.
2. Let <var>x</var> be <var>e</var>’s current scroll position on the x axis.
3. Let <var>y</var> be <var>e</var>’s current scroll position on the y axis.
4. Use the <a spec=CSSOM-VIEW-1>scroll an element</a> algorithm from [[!CSSOM-VIEW-1]] on <var>e</var> to
    * (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var> - <var>d</var>) if <var>dir</var> is <code>up</code>
