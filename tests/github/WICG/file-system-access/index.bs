Title: File System Access
Shortname: file-system-access
Abstract: This document defines a web platform API that enables developers to build
  powerful web apps that interact with files on the user's local device.
  It builds on [[FILE-API|File API]] for file reading capabilities, and adds new API
  surface to enable modifying files, as well as working with directories.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

This API enables developers to build powerful apps that interact with other
(non-Web) apps on the user's device via the device's file system. Prominent
examples of applications where users expect this functionality are IDEs,
photo and video editors, text editors, and more.
After a user grants a web app access, this API allows the app to read or save
changes directly to files and folders on the user's device. Beyond reading and
writing files, this API provides the ability to open a directory and enumerate
its contents. Additionally, web apps can use this API to store references to
files and directories they've been given access to, allowing the web apps to
later regain access to the same content without requiring the user to select the
same file again.

This API is similar to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#file-upload-state-(type=file)">`<input type=file>`</a>
and <a href="https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/#html-forms">`<input type=file webkitdirectory>`</a>
[[entries-api]]
in that user interaction happens through file and directory picker dialogs.
Unlike those APIs, this API is currently purely a javascript API, and
does not integrate with forms and/or input elements.

Additionally this API also makes it possible for websites to get access to some
directory without having to first prompt the user for access. This enables use
cases where a website wants to save data to disk before a user has picked a
location to save to, without forcing the website to use a completely different
storage mechanism with a different API for such files. It also makes it easier
to write automated tests for code using this API. The entry point for this is the
{{StorageManager/getDirectory()|navigator.storage.getDirectory()}} method. This
is similar to the temporary file system as defined in earlier drafts of
[[file-system-api|File API: Directories and System]].

# Files and Directories # {#files-and-directories}

## Concepts ## {#concepts}

An <dfn>entry</dfn> is either a [=file entry=] or a [=directory entry=].

Each [=/entry=] has an associated <dfn for=entry>name</dfn> (a [=string=]).

A <dfn>valid file name</dfn> is a [=string=] that is not an empty string, is not equal to "." or "..",
and does not contain '/' or any other character used as path separator on the underlying platform.

Note: This means that '\' is not allowed in names on Windows, but might be allowed on
other operating systems. Additionally underlying file systems might have further restrictions
on what names are or aren't allowed, so a string merely being a [=valid file name=] is not
a guarantee that creating a file or directory with that name will succeed.

Issue: We should consider having further normative restrictions on file names that will
never be allowed using this API, rather than leaving it entirely up to underlying file
systems.

A <dfn>valid suffix code point</dfn> is a [=code point=] that is [=ASCII alphanumeric=],
U+002B (+), or U+002E (.).

Note: These code points were chosen to support most pre-existing file formats. The vast
majority of file extensions are purely alphanumeric, but compound extensions (such as
`.tar.gz`) and extensions such as `.c++` for C++ source code are also fairly common,
hence the inclusion of + and . as allowed code points.

A <dfn lt="file|file entry">file entry</dfn> additionally consists of
<dfn for="file entry">binary data</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]) and a
<dfn for="file entry">modification timestamp</dfn> (a number representing the number of milliseconds since the <a spec=FileAPI>Unix Epoch</a>).

A <dfn lt="directory|directory entry">directory entry</dfn> additionally consists of a [=/set=] of
<dfn for="directory entry">children</dfn>, which are themselves [=/entries=]. Each member is either a [=/file=] or a [=directory=].

An [=/entry=] |entry| should be [=list/contained=] in the [=children=] of at most one
[=directory entry=], and that directory entry is also known as |entry|'s <dfn for=entry>parent</dfn>.
An [=/entry=]'s [=entry/parent=] is null if no such directory entry exists.

Note: Two different [=/entries=] can represent the same file or directory on disk, in which
case it is possible for both entries to have a different parent, or for one entry to have a
parent while the other entry does not have a parent. Typically an entry does not have a parent
if it was returned by {{StorageManager/getDirectory()|navigator.storage.getDirectory()}}
or one of the [=local file system handle factories=],
and an entry will have a parent in all other cases.

[=/Entries=] can (but don't have to) be backed by files on the host operating system's local file system,
so it is possible for the [=binary data=], [=modification timestamp=],
and [=children=] of entries to be modified by applications outside of this specification.
Exactly how external changes are reflected in the data structures defined by this specification,
as well as how changes made to the data structures defined here are reflected externally
is left up to individual user-agent implementations.

An [=/entry=] |a| is <dfn for="entry">the same as</dfn> an [=/entry=] |b| if |a| is equal to |b|, or
if |a| and |b| are backed by the same file or directory on the local file system.

Issue: TODO: Explain better how entries map to files on disk (multiple entries can map to the same file or
directory on disk but an entry doesn't have to map to any file on disk).

<div algorithm>
To <dfn for="entry">resolve</dfn> an [=/entry=] |child| relative to a [=directory entry=] |root|,
run the following steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. If |child| is [=the same as=] |root|,
     [=/resolve=] |result| with an empty list, and abort.
  1. Let |childPromises| be « ».
  1. [=set/For each=] |entry| of |root|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=]'s [=children=]:
    1. Let |p| be the result of [=entry/resolving=] |child| relative to |entry|.
    1. [=list/Append=] |p| to |childPromises|.
    1. [=Upon fulfillment=] of |p| with value |path|:
      1. If |path| is not null:
        1. [=list/Prepend=] |entry|'s [=entry/name=] to |path|.
        1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |path|.
  1. [=Wait for all=] |childPromises|, with the following success steps:
    1. If |result| hasn't been resolved yet, [=/resolve=] |result| with `null`.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

## Permissions ## {#permissions}

The <dfn for=PermissionName enum-value>"file-system"</dfn> [=powerful feature=]'s
permission-related algorithms and types are defined as follows:

: [=permission descriptor type=]
:: {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor}}, defined as:
  <xmp class=idl>
  enum FileSystemPermissionMode {
    "read",
    "readwrite"
  };

  dictionary FileSystemPermissionDescriptor : PermissionDescriptor {
    required FileSystemHandle handle;
    FileSystemPermissionMode mode = "read";
  };
  </xmp>

: [=permission state constraints=]
:: <div algorithm="permission state constraints">
  To determine [=permission state constraints=] for a {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor}} |desc|,
  run these steps:

  1. Let |entry| be |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}}'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. If |entry| represents an [=/entry=] in an [=origin private file system=],
    this descriptor's [=permission state=] must always be {{PermissionState/"granted"}}.
  1. Otherwise, if |entry|'s [=entry/parent=] is not null, this descriptor's [=permission state=] must be
    equal to the [=permission state=] for a descriptor with the same {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}},
    and a {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} representing |entry|'s [=entry/parent=].
  1. Otherwise, if |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} is {{"readwrite"}}:
    1. Let |read state| be the [=permission state=] for a descriptor
      with the same {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}},
      but {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} = {{"read"}}.
    1. If |read state| is not {{PermissionState/"granted"}}, this descriptor's [=permission state=]
      must be equal to |read state|.

: [=permission request algorithm=]
:: <div algorithm="permission request algorithm">
  Given a {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor}} |desc| and a {{PermissionStatus}} |status|,
  run these steps:

  1. Run the [=boolean permission query algorithm=] on |desc| and |status|.
  1. If |status|.{{PermissionStatus/state}} is not {{PermissionState/"prompt"}}, abort.
  1. Let |settings| be |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}}'s [=relevant settings object=].
  1. Let |global| be |settings|'s [=environment settings object/global object=].
  1. If |global| is not a {{Window}}, throw a {{SecurityError}}.
  1. If |global| does not have [=transient activation=], throw a {{SecurityError}}.
  1. If |settings|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] is not [=same origin=] with |settings|'s [=top-level origin=],
     throw a {{SecurityError}}.
  1. [=Request permission to use=] |desc|.
  1. Run the [=boolean permission query algorithm=] on |desc| and |status|.

  Issue(WICG/permissions-request#2): Ideally this user activation requirement would be defined upstream.

<div algorithm>
To <dfn lt="querying file system permission|query file system permission">query file system permission</dfn>
given a {{FileSystemHandle}} |handle| and a {{FileSystemPermissionMode}} |mode|, run these steps:

1. Let |desc| be a {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor}}.
1. Set |desc|.{{PermissionDescriptor/name}} to {{"file-system"}}.
1. Set |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} to |handle|.
1. Set |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} to |mode|.
1. Return |desc|'s [=permission state=].

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn lt="requesting file system permission|request file system permission">request file system permission</dfn>
given a {{FileSystemHandle}} |handle| and a {{FileSystemPermissionMode}} |mode|, run these steps:

1. Let |desc| be a {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor}}.
1. Set |desc|.{{PermissionDescriptor/name}} to {{"file-system"}}.
1. Set |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} to |handle|.
1. Set |desc|.{{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} to |mode|.
1. Let |status| be the result of running <a spec=permissions>create a PermissionStatus</a> for |desc|.
1. Run the [=permission request algorithm=] for the {{"file-system"}} feature, given |desc| and |status|.
1. Return |desc|'s [=permission state=].

</div>

Issue(119): Currently {{FileSystemPermissionMode}} can only be {{"read"}} or {{"readwrite"}}. In
the future we might want to add a "write" mode as well to support write-only handles.

## The {{FileSystemHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemhandle}

<xmp class=idl>
dictionary FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor {
  FileSystemPermissionMode mode = "read";
};

enum FileSystemHandleKind {
  "file",
  "directory",
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker), SecureContext, Serializable]
interface FileSystemHandle {
  readonly attribute FileSystemHandleKind kind;
  readonly attribute USVString name;

  Promise<boolean> isSameEntry(FileSystemHandle other);

  Promise<PermissionState> queryPermission(optional FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor descriptor = {});
  Promise<PermissionState> requestPermission(optional FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor descriptor = {});
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemHandle}} object represents an [=/entry=]. Each {{FileSystemHandle}} object is associated
with an <dfn for=FileSystemHandle>entry</dfn> (an [=/entry=]). Multiple separate objects implementing
the {{FileSystemHandle}} interface can all be associated with the same [=/entry=] simultaneously.

<div algorithm="serialization steps">
{{FileSystemHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=].

Advisement: In the Origin Trial as available in Chrome 78, these objects are not yet serializable. 
In Chrome 82 they are.

Their [=serialization steps=], given |value|, |serialized| and <var ignore>forStorage</var> are:

1. Set |serialized|.\[[Origin]] to |value|'s [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=].
1. Set |serialized|.\[[Entry]] to |value|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].

</div>

<div algorithm="deserialization steps">
Their [=deserialization steps=], given |serialized| and |value| are:

1. If |serialized|.\[[Origin]] is not [=same origin=] with
   |value|'s [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=],
   then throw a {{DataCloneError}}.
1. Set |value|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] to |serialized|.\[[Entry]]

</div>

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/kind}}
  :: Returns {{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}} if |handle| is a {{FileSystemFileHandle}},
     or {{FileSystemHandleKind/"directory"}} if |handle| is a {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}}.

     This can be used to distinguish files from directories when iterating over the contents
     of a directory.

  : |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/name}}
  :: Returns the [=entry/name=] of the entry represented by |handle|.
</div>

The <dfn attribute for=FileSystemHandle>kind</dfn> attribute must
return {{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}} if the associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] is a [=file entry=],
and return {{FileSystemHandleKind/"directory"}} otherwise.

The <dfn attribute for=FileSystemHandle>name</dfn> attribute must return the [=entry/name=] of the
associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].

### The {{FileSystemHandle/isSameEntry()}} method ### {#api-filesystemhandle-issameentry}

<div class="note domintro">
  : <var ignore>same</var> = await |handle1| . {{FileSystemHandle/isSameEntry()|isSameEntry}}( |handle2| )
  :: Returns true if |handle1| and |handle2| represent the same file or directory.
</div>

Advisement: This method is first available in Chrome 82.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemHandle>isSameEntry(|other|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |realm| be [=this=]'s [=relevant Realm=].
1. Let |p| be [=a new promise=] in |realm|.
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. If [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] is [=the same as=] |other|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=],
     [=/resolve=] |p| with `true`.
  1. Else [=/resolve=] |p| with `false`.
1. Return |p|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemHandle/queryPermission()}} method ### {#api-filesystemhandle-querypermission}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/queryPermission()|queryPermission}}({ {{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}} : {{"read"}} })
  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/queryPermission()}}

  :: Queries the current state of the read permission of this handle. If this returns `"prompt"`
     the website will have to call {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()}} before any
     operations on the handle can be done. If this returns `"denied"` any operations will reject.

     Usually handles returned by the [=local file system handle factories=] will initially return `"granted"` for
     their read permission state, however other than through the user revoking permission, a handle
     retrieved from IndexedDB is also likely to return `"prompt"`.

  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/queryPermission()|queryPermission}}({ {{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}} : {{"readwrite"}} })
  : |status| = (await navigator.{{Navigator/permissions}}.{{Permissions/query()|query}}({ {{PermissionDescriptor/name}} : "file-system", {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} : |handle|, {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} : {{"readwrite"}}}).{{PermissionStatus/state}}
  :: Queries the current state of the write permission of this handle. If this returns `"prompt"`,
     attempting to modify the file or directory this handle represents will require user activation
     and will result in a confirmation prompt being shown to the user. However if the state of the
     read permission of this handle is also `"prompt"` the website will need to call
     {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()}}. There is no automatic prompting for read access when
     attempting to read from a file or directory.
</div>

Advisement: The integration with the permissions API's {{Permissions/query()}} method is not yet implemented in Chrome.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemHandle>queryPermission(|descriptor|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |state| be the result of [=querying file system permission=]
     given <b>[=this=]</b> and |descriptor|.{{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}}.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |state|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()}} method ### {#api-filesystemhandle-requestpermission}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()|requestPermission}}({ {{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}} : {{"read"}} })
  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()}}
  :: If the state of the read permission of this handle is anything other than `"prompt"`, this
     will return that state directly. If it is `"prompt"` however, user activation is needed and
     this will show a confirmation prompt to the user. The new read permission state is then
     returned, depending on the user's response to the prompt.

  : |status| = await |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/requestPermission()|requestPermission}}({ {{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}} : {{"readwrite"}} })
  :: If the state of the write permission of this handle is anything other than `"prompt"`, this
     will return that state directly. If the status of the read permission of this handle is
     `"denied"` this will return that.

     Otherwise the state of the write permission is `"prompt"` and this will show a confirmation
     prompt to the user. The new write permission state is then returned, depending on what the user
     selected.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemHandle>requestPermission(|descriptor|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |state| be the result of [=requesting file system permission=]
     given <b>[=this=]</b> and |descriptor|.{{FileSystemHandlePermissionDescriptor/mode}}.
     If that throws an exception, [=reject=] |result| with that exception and abort.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |state|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

## The {{FileSystemFileHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemfilehandle}

<xmp class=idl>
dictionary FileSystemCreateWritableOptions {
  boolean keepExistingData = false;
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker), SecureContext, Serializable]
interface FileSystemFileHandle : FileSystemHandle {
  Promise<File> getFile();
  Promise<FileSystemWritableFileStream> createWritable(optional FileSystemCreateWritableOptions options = {});
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemFileHandle}}'s associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] must be a [=file entry=].

{{FileSystemFileHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=] and
[=deserialization steps=] are the same as those for {{FileSystemHandle}}.

Advisement: In the Origin Trial as available in Chrome 78, these objects are not yet serializable. 
In Chrome 82 they are.

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/getFile()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-getfile}

<div class="note domintro">
  : <var ignore>file</var> = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/getFile()}}
  :: Returns a {{File}} representing the state on disk of the entry represented by |handle|.
     If the file on disk changes or is removed after this method is called, the returned
     {{File}} object will likely be no longer readable.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemFileHandle>getFile()</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |permissionStatus| be the result of [=querying file system permission=]
     given <b>[=this=]</b> and {{"read"}}.
  1. If |permissionStatus| is not {{PermissionState/"granted"}},
     reject |result| with a {{NotAllowedError}} and abort.
  1. Let |entry| be <b>[=this=]</b>'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. Let |f| be a new {{File}}.
  1. Set |f|'s <a spec=FileAPI>snapshot state</a> to the current state of |entry|.
  1. Set |f|'s underlying byte sequence to a copy of |entry|'s [=binary data=].
  1. Initialize the value of |f|'s {{File/name}} attribute to |entry|'s [=entry/name=].
  1. Initialize the value of |f|'s {{File/lastModified}} attribute to |entry|'s [=file entry/modification timestamp=].
  1. Initialize the value of |f|'s {{Blob/type}} attribute to an implementation defined value, based on for example |entry|'s [=entry/name=] and/or its file extension.

     Issue: The reading and snapshotting behavior needs to be better specified in the [[FILE-API]] spec,
     for now this is kind of hand-wavy.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |f|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-createwritable}

Advisement: In the Origin Trial as available in Chrome 82, createWritable replaces the createWriter method.

<div class="note domintro">
  : |stream| = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()}}
  : |stream| = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()|createWritable}}({ {{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}}: true/false })
  :: Returns a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} that can be used to write to the file. Any changes made through
     |stream| won't be reflected in the file represented by |fileHandle| until the stream has been closed.
     User agents try to ensure that no partial writes happen, i.e. the file represented by
     |fileHandle| will either contains its old contents or it will contain whatever data was written
     through |stream| up until the stream has been closed.

     This is typically implemented by writing data to a temporary file, and only replacing the file
     represented by |fileHandle| with the temporary file when the writable filestream is closed.

     If {{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}} is `false` or not specified,
     the temporary file starts out empty,
     otherwise the existing file is first copied to this temporary file.
</div>

Issue(67): There has been some discussion around and desire for a "inPlace" mode for createWritable
(where changes will be written to the actual underlying file as they are written to the writer, for
example to support in-place modification of large files or things like databases). This is not
currently implemented in Chrome. Implementing this is currently blocked on figuring out how to
combine the desire to run malware checks with the desire to let websites make fast in-place
modifications to existing large files.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemFileHandle>createWritable(|options|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |permissionStatus| be the result of [=requesting file system permission=]
     given <b>[=this=]</b> and {{"readwrite"}}.
     If that throws an exception, [=reject=] |result| with that exception and abort.
  1. If |permissionStatus| is not {{PermissionState/"granted"}},
     reject |result| with a {{NotAllowedError}} and abort.
  1. Let |entry| be <b>[=this=]</b>'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. Let |stream| be the result of [=create a new FileSystemWritableFileStream|creating a new FileSystemWritableFileStream=]
     for |entry| in <b>[=this=]</b>'s [=relevant realm=].
  1. If |options|.{{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}} is `true`:
    1. Set |stream|.[=[[buffer]]=] to a copy of |entry|'s [=file entry/binary data=].
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |stream|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

## The {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemdirectoryhandle}

<xmp class=idl>
dictionary FileSystemGetFileOptions {
  boolean create = false;
};

dictionary FileSystemGetDirectoryOptions {
  boolean create = false;
};

dictionary FileSystemRemoveOptions {
  boolean recursive = false;

  Promise<undefined> removeEntry(USVString name, optional FileSystemRemoveOptions options = {});

  Promise<sequence<USVString>?> resolve(FileSystemHandle possibleDescendant);
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}}'s associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] must be a [=directory entry=].

{{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=] and
[=deserialization steps=] are the same as those for {{FileSystemHandle}}.

Advisement: In the Origin Trial as available in Chrome 78, these objects are not yet serializable. 
In Chrome 82 they are.

Advisement: In Chrome versions upto Chrome 85 `getFileHandle` and `getDirectoryHandle` where
called `getFile` and `getDirectory` instead.

### Directory iteration ### {#api-filesystemdirectoryhandle-asynciterable}

<div class="note domintro">
  : for await (let [|name|, |handle|] of |directoryHandle|) {}
  : for await (let [|name|, |handle|] of |directoryHandle| . entries()) {}
  : for await (let |handle| of |directoryHandle| . values()) {}
  : for await (let |name| of |directoryHandle| . keys()) {}
  :: Iterates over all entries whose parent is the entry represented by |directoryHandle|. Entries
     that are created or deleted while the iteration is in progress might or might not be included.
     No guarantees are given either way.
</div>

Advisement: In Chrome this is currently implemented as a `directoryHandle.getEntries()` method that can be used in a `for await..of` loop.
This `getEntries()` method returns more or less the same async iterable as what is returned by `values()` in this specification.
The proper async iterable declaration is not yet implemented.

Issue(173): In the future we might want to add arguments to the async iterable declaration to
support for example recursive iteration.

<div algorithm="iterator initialization">
The [=asynchronous iterator initialization steps=] for a {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}} |handle|

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[file]]</dfn> (a [=file entry=]).

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[buffer]]</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]).
It is initially empty.

Note: This buffer can get arbitrarily large, so it is expected that implementations will not keep this in memory,
but instead use a temporary file for this. All access to \[[buffer]] is done in promise returning methods and
algorithms, so even though operations on it seem sync, implementations can implement them async.

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[seekOffset]]</dfn> (a number).
It is initially 0.

<div class="note domintro">
A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object is a {{WritableStream}} object with additional
convenience methods, which operates on a single file on disk.

Upon creation, an underlying sink will have been created and the stream will be usable.
All operations executed on the stream are queuable and producers will be able to respond to backpressure.

The underlying sink's write method, and therefore {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}}
method, will accept byte-like data or {{WriteParams}} as input.

The {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has a file position cursor initialized at byte offset 0 from the top of the file.
When using {{FileSystemWritableFileStream/write()|write()}} or by using WritableStream capabilities through the {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}} method, this position will be advanced based on the number of bytes written through the stream object.

Similarly, when piping a {{ReadableStream}} into a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object, this position is updated with the number of bytes that passed through the stream.

{{WritableStream/getWriter()|getWriter()}} returns an instance of {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}}.

The {{showOpenFilePicker()}}, {{showSaveFilePicker()}} and {{showDirectoryPicker()}} methods
are together known as the <dfn>local file system handle factories</dfn>.

Note: What is referred to as the "local file system" in this spec, does not have to
strictly refer to the file system on the local device. What we call the local file system
could just as well be backed by a cloud provider. For example on Chrome OS these
file pickers will also let you pick files and directories on Google Drive.

Advisement: In Chrome versions earlier than 85, this was implemented as a generic `chooseFileSystemEntries` method.

## Local File System Permissions ## {#local-file-system-permissions}

The fact that the user picked the specific files returned by the [=local file system handle factories=] in a prompt
should be treated by the user agent as the user intending to grant read access to the website
for the returned files. As such, at the time the promise returned by one of the [=local file system handle factories=]
resolves, [=permission state=] for a descriptor with {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} set to the returned handle,
and {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} set to {{"read"}}
should be {{PermissionState/"granted"}}.

Additionally for calls to {{showSaveFilePicker}}
the [=permission state=] for a descriptor with {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/handle}} set to the returned handle,
and {{FileSystemPermissionDescriptor/mode}} set to {{readwrite}}
should be {{PermissionState/"granted"}}.

<div algorithm>
To verify that an |environment| <dfn>is allowed to show a file picker</dfn>, run these steps:

1. If |environment|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] is an [=opaque origin=],

## {{FilePickerOptions}}.{{FilePickerOptions/types}} ## {#api-filpickeroptions-types}

<div class="note domintro">
The {{showOpenFilePicker(options)}} and {{showSaveFilePicker(options)}} methods accept a
{{FilePickerOptions}} argument, which lets the website specify the types of files
the file picker will let the user select.

Each entry in {{FilePickerOptions/types}} specifies a single user selectable option
for filtering the files displayed in the file picker.

Each option consists of an <span class=allow-2119>optional</span> {{FilePickerAcceptType/description}}
and a number of MIME types and extensions (specified as a mapping of
MIME type to a list of extensions). If no description is provided one will be generated.
Extensions have to be strings that start with a "." and only contain [=valid suffix code points=].
Additionally extensions are limited to a length of 16 code points.

In addition to complete MIME types, "\*" can be used as the subtype of a MIME type to match
for example all image formats with "image/\*".

Websites <span class=allow-2119>should</span> always provide both MIME types and file
extensions for each option. On platforms that only use file extensions to describe file types
user agents can match on the extensions, while on platforms that don't use extensions,
user agents can match on MIME type.

By default the file picker will also include an option to not apply any filter,
letting the user select any file. Set {{excludeAcceptAllOption}} to `true` to not
include this option in the file picker.

For example , the following options will let the user pick one of three different filters.
One for text files (either plain text or HTML), one for images, and a third one that doesn't apply
any filter and lets the user select any file.

<pre class=example id="filepickeroptions-example1" highlight=js>
const options = {
  <l>{{FilePickerOptions/types}}</l>: [
    {
      <l>{{FilePickerAcceptType/description}}</l>: 'Text Files',
      <l>{{FilePickerAcceptType/accept}}</l>: {
        'text/plain': ['.txt', '.text'],
        'text/html': ['.html', '.htm']
      }
    },
    {
      <l>{{FilePickerAcceptType/description}}</l>: 'Images',
      <l>{{FilePickerAcceptType/accept}}</l>: {
        'image/*': ['.png', '.gif', '.jpeg', '.jpg']
      }
    }
  ],
};
</pre>

On the other hand, the following example will only let the user select SVG files. The dialog
will not show an option to not apply any filters.

<pre class=example id="filepickeroptions-example2" highlight=js>
const options = {
  <l>{{FilePickerOptions/types}}</l>: [
    {
      <l>{{FilePickerAcceptType/accept}}</l>: {

  ],

Issue: This currently does not block access to [=too sensitive or dangerous=] directories, to
be consistent with other APIs that give access to dropped files and directories. This is inconsistent

# Accessing the Origin Private File System # {#sandboxed-filesystem}

and <a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">quota</a> is null.

Issue: Storage endpoints should be defined in [[storage]] itself, rather
than being defined here. So merge this into the table there.

Note: While user agents will typically implement this by persisting the contents of this
[=origin private file system=] to disk, it is not intended that the contents are easily
user accessible. Similarly there is no expectation that files or directories with names
matching the names of children of the [=origin private file system=] exist.

<xmp class=idl>
[SecureContext]
partial interface StorageManager {
  Promise<FileSystemDirectoryHandle> getDirectory();

  :: Returns the root directory of the origin private file system.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=StorageManager>getDirectory()</dfn> method, when
invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |environment| be the [=current settings object=].

1. Let |map| be the result of running [=obtain a local storage bottle map=]
   with |environment| and `"fileSystem"`. If this returns failure,
   return [=a promise rejected with=] a {{SecurityError}}.

1. If |map|["root"] does not [=map/exist=]:
  1. Let |dir| be a new [=directory entry=].
  1. Set |dir|'s [=entry/name=] to `""`.
  1. Set |dir|'s [=directory entry/children=] to an empty [=/set=].
  1. Set |map|["root"] to |dir|.

1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] a new {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}},
   whose associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] is |map|["root"].

</div>

Note: In Chrome the directory entry returned by the above algorithm refers to the same storage as the
<a href="https://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-dir-sys.html#dfn-temporary">temporary

# Accessibility Considerations # {#accessibility-considerations}

*This section is non-normative.*

When this specification is used to present information in the user interface,
implementors will want to follow the OS level accessibility guidelines for the platform.


# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy-considerations}

*This section is non-normative.*

This API does not give websites any more read access to data than the existing `<input type=file>`
and `<input type=file webkitdirectory>` APIs already do. Furthermore similarly to those APIs, all
access to files and directories is explicitly gated behind a file or directory picker.

There are however several major privacy risks with this new API:

## Users giving access to more, or more sensitive files than they intended. ## {#privacy-wide-access}

This isn't a new risk with this API, but user agents should try to make sure that users are aware
of what exactly they're giving websites access to. This is particularly important when giving
access to a directory, where it might not be immediately clear to a user just how many files
actually exist in that directory.

A related risk is having a user give access to particularly sensitive data. This
could include some of a user agent's configuration data, network cache or cookie store,
or operating system configuration data such as password files. To protect against this, user agents
are encouraged to restrict which directories a user is allowed to select in a directory picker,
and potentially even restrict which files the user is allowed to select. This will make it much
harder to accidentally give access to a directory that contains particularly sensitive data. Care
must be taken to strike the right balance between restricting what the API can access while still
having the API be useful. After all, this API intentionally lets the user use websites to interact
with some of their most private personal data.

Examples of directories that user agents might want to restrict as being
<dfn>too sensitive or dangerous</dfn> include:

* The directory or directories containing the user agent itself.
* Directories where the user agent stores [=storage|website storage=].
* Directories containing system files (such as `C:\Windows` on Windows).
* Directories such as `/dev/`, `/sys`, and `/proc` on Linux that would give access to low-level devices.
* A user's entire "home" directory.
  Individual files and directories inside the home directory should still be allowed,
  but user agents should not generally let users give blanket access to the entire directory.
* The default directory for downloads, if the user agent has such a thing.
  Individual files inside the directory again should be allowed, but the whole directory would risk leaking more data than a user realizes.
* Files with names that end in `.lnk`, when selecting a file to write to. Writing to
  these files on Windows is similar to creating symlinks on other operating systems,
  and as such can be used to attempt to trick users into giving access to files they didn't intend to expose.
* Files with names that end in `.local`, when selecting a file to write to.
  Windows uses these files to decide what DLLs to load, and as such writing to
  these files could be used to cause code to be executed.

## Websites trying to use this API for tracking. ## {#privacy-tracking}

This API could be used by websites to track the user across clearing browsing
data. This is because, in contrast with existing file access APIs, user agents are
able to grant persistent access to files or directories and can re-prompt. In
combination with the ability to write to files, websites will be able to persist an
identifier on the users' disk. Clearing browsing data will not affect those files
in any way, making these identifiers persist through those actions.

This risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that clearing browsing data will clear all handles
that a website had persisted (for example in IndexedDB),
so websites won't have any handles to re-prompt for permission after browsing data was cleared.
Furthermore user agents are encouraged to make it clear what files and directories a website has
access to, and to automatically expire permission grants except for particularly well trusted
origins (for example persistent permissions could be limited to "installed" web applications).

User agents also are encouraged to provide a way for users to revoke permissions granted.
Clearing browsing data is expected to revoke all permissions as well.

## First-party vs third-party contexts. ## {#privacy-third-party}

In third-party contexts (e.g. an iframe whose origin does not match that of the top-level frame)
websites can't gain access to data they don't already have access to. This includes both getting
access to new files or directories via the [=local file system handle factories=], as well as requesting
more permissions to existing handles via the {{requestPermission}} API.

Handles can also only be post-messaged to same-origin destinations. Attempts to send a handle to
a cross-origin destination will result in a {{MessagePort/messageerror}} event.

# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

*This section is non-normative.*

This API gives websites the ability to modify existing files on disk, as well as write to new
files. This has a couple of important security considerations:

## Malware ## {#security-malware}

This API could be used by websites to try to store and/or execute malware on the users system.
To mitigate this risk, this API does not provide any way to mark files as executable (on the other
hand files that are already executable likely remain that way, even after the files are modified
through this API). Furthermore user agents are encouraged to apply things like Mark-of-the-Web to
files created or modified by this API.

Finally, user agents are encouraged to verify the contents of files modified by this API via <dfn>malware
scans and safe browsing checks</dfn>, unless some kind of external strong trust relation already exists.
This of course has effects on the performance characteristics of this API.

## Ransomware attacks ## {#security-ransomware}

Another risk factor is that of ransomware attacks. The limitations described above regarding
blocking access to certain sensitive directories helps limit the damage such an attack can do.
Additionally user agents can grant write access to files at whatever granularity they deem
appropriate.
