Executive summary {#summary}
=================

We have not met in-person since the February 2020 meeting in Prague because of the global pandemic. We're instead holding weekly teleconferences, as detailed in [[P2145R1]]. We focus on providing non-final guidance, and will use electronic straw polls as detailed in [[P2195R0]] to move papers and issues forward in a asynchronous manner.

Our main achievements have been:

* **Issue processing**: most of the 50 language evolution issues have proposed resolutions, and a large number of them have been voted on through electronic polling.
* **C++23**: we've started work on papers for C++23 and later.
* **Incubation**: we've acted as EWG-I and "incubated" some early papers by providing early feedback to authors.

This paper outlines:

* The work achieved in [[#telecons]]; 
* Lists the [[#polls]] for the August 2021 polling period and explain the [[#process]] (see [[P1018r9]] for the results of the February 2021 polling period and [[P1018r11]] for the results of the May 2021 polling period);
* Lists the remaining outstanding issues in [[#issues]], some are still open while others are waiting for polling;
* [[#future]].


Paper of note {#note}
=============

* [[P1000R4]] C++ IS schedule
* [[P0592R4]] To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++23
* [[P1999R0]] Process: double-check evolutionary material via a Tentatively Ready status
* [[P2195R0]] Electronic Straw Polls
* [[P2145R1]] Evolving C++ Remotely


Tentatively ready papers {#tentative}
========================

Following our process in [[P1999R0]], we usually mark papers as tentatively ready for CWG. We would usually take a brief look at the next meeting, and if nothing particular concerns anyone, send them to CWG. However, given the pandemic, we've decided to provide guidance only in virtual teleconferences, and have an asynchronous polling mechanism to officially send papers to CWG or other groups as detailed in [[P2195R0]].

You can follow the lists of papers on GitHub:

* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/TentativelyReady">tentatively ready papers</a>,
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/EWG-vote-on-me">EWG vote on me papers</a>.


Issue Processing {#issue-pro}
================

We've reviewed 50 Language Evolution issues at the Core groups' request, and have tentative resolutions for most. We don't want to poll all of these at the same time, and therefore only poll a subset in each polling period, reserving other issues for later polling periods. We've therefore only poll the "tentatively ready" issues (since they're tied to papers, and polled with said papers, as outlined below), as well as the "resolved" issues since telecon attendees believe that prior work has already addressed the issues.

[[#issues]] contains a list of issues which aren't being voted on in this polling period.


Poll {#polls}
====

The polls which EWG will take in the August 2021 polling period are:

P2138r4 Rules of Design `<=>` Wording engagement {#P2138r4}
-------

* [[P2138r4]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/853">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** process description of how proposal reviews should work between Language Evolution and Core, as well as between Library Evolution and Library.
* **🗳  Poll:** For the next plenary, put up the following joint Language and Library Evolution motion: P2138r4 "Rules of Design `<=>` Wording engagement" as the official process of the C++ Evolution groups.

P2266r1 Simpler implicit move {#P2266r1}
-------

* [[P2266r1]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/968">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** In C++20, `return` statements can *implicitly move* from local variables of *rvalue* reference type; but a defect in the wording means that *implicit move* fails to apply to functions that return references. C++20’s implicit move is specified via a complicated process involving two overload resolutions, which is hard to implement, causing implementation divergence. We fix the defect and simplify the spec by saying that a returned move-eligible *id-expression* is always an *xvalue*.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2266r1 "Simpler implicit move" to Core for C++23.


P2128r5 Multidimensional subscript operator {#P2128r5}
-------

* [[P2128r5]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/845">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** user-defined types can define a subscript operator with multiple arguments to better support multi-dimensional containers and views, for example `template<class... IndexType> constexpr reference operator[](IndexType...);`.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2128r5 "Multidimensional subscript operator" to Core for C++23.

P2036r2 Changing scope for lambda *trailing-return-type* {#P2036r2}
-------

* [[P2036r2]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/766">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** the way that name lookup works in lambdas is surprising: it behaves differently in the trailing-return-type than it does in the lambda body. The current behavior is surprising and error-prone. The proposed change treats the *trailing-return-type* like the function body rather than treating it like a function parameter.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2036r2 "Changing scope for lambda trailing-return-type" to Core for C++23. Treat it as a Defect Report.

P2334r1 Add support for preprocessing directives `elifdef` and `elifndef` {#P2334r1}
-------

* [[P2334r1]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1016">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** the `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` preprocessing directives exist today as shorthand for `#if defined(identifier)` and `#if !defined(identifier)`, respectively. However, no analogous shorthand preprocessing directives exist for `#elif defined(identifier)` and `#elif !defined(identifier)`. Add two new preprocessing directives `#elifdef` and `#elifndef` that exactly parallel the functionality supplied in the existing `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` directives.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2334r1 "Add support for preprocessing directives `elifdef` and `elifndef`" to Core for C++23.

P2066r7 Suggested draft TS for C++ Extensions for Transaction Memory Light {#P2066r7}
-------

* [[P2066r7]]
* See [[P1875r2]] for discussion.
* Current TS [[N4514]]: ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Transactional Memory.
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/793">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** transactions can be expressed with atomic statements of the form `atomic do { /* work goes here */ }`.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2066r7 "Suggested draft TS for C++ Extensions for Transaction Memory Light" to Core to become the Transactional Memory TS v2.

P2360r0 Extend *init-statement* to allow *alias-declaration* {#P2360r0}
-------

* [[P2360r0]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1034">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** This is currently valid `for (typedef int T; T e : v) /* something */;` but this isn't `for (using T = int; T e : v) /* something */;`. Make the later one valid.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2360r0 "Extend *init-statement* to allow *alias-declaration*" to Core for C++23.

P2246r1 Character encoding of diagnostic text {#P2246r1}
-------

* [[P2246r1]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/942">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** the standard provides a few mechanisms that suggest an implementation issues a diagnostic based on text written in the source code. However, the standard does not uniformly address what should happen if the execution character set of the compiler cannot represent the text in the source character set. Because the display of diagnostic messages should be merely a matter of Quality of Implementation, the proposal is to place no character set related requirements on the diagnostic output with the understanding that implementations will do what makes the most sense for their situation when issuing diagnostics in terms of which characters need to be escaped or otherwise handled in a special way. 
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2246r1 "Character encoding of diagnostic text" to Core for C++23.

P2314r2 Character sets and encodings {#P2314r2}
-------

* [[P2314r2]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/998">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** switch C++ to a modified "model C" approach for universal-character-names as described in the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99 Rationale v5.10</a>, section 5.2.1. Introduce the term "literal encoding". For purposes of the C++ specification, the actual set of characters is not relevant, but the sequence of code units (i.e. the encoding) specified by a given character or string literal are.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2314r2 "Character sets and encodings" to Core for C++23.

P2316r1 Consistent character literal encoding {#P2316r1}
-------

* [[P2316r1]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1000">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** character literals in preprocessor conditional are changed to behave the same way as they do in C++ expressions. For example, `'A' == '\x41'` is not currently guaranteed to behave the same in a preprocessor condition as it is in a C++ expression.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2316r1 "Consistent character literal encoding" to Core for C++23. Treat it as a Defect Report.


<!-- For next polling period:

P2280r2 Using unknown references in constant expressions {#P2280r2}
-------

* [[P2280r2]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/973">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** `constexpr` usage of unknown references doesn't work, that's surprising, make it work as expected.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2280r2 "Using unknown references in constant expressions" to Core for C++23. Treat it as a Defect Report.

        <p>Davis: the current name lookup approach which Core is taking in p1787 would disallow this. Supporting this is possible, it would be inconsistent, but would also be a feature.</p>
        <p><a href="https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21summer2020/EWG22-Oct-2020">Notes 2020-10-22</a>: wait until p1787 is voted into the working draft, because it’s making this behavior intentional. At that point, we can vote on marking the issue as Not a Defect. No objection to unanimous consent.</p>

        <p>[Detailed description pending.]</p>
        <p><b>Hubert:</b> question over the role of the `inline` keyword in relation to explicit instantiation declarations.</p>
        <p>For `inline` functions, explicit instantiation declarations do not have the effect of suppressing implicit instantiation.</p>
        <p>A user's desire for wanting to suppress implicit instantiation can arise for different reasons:</p>
        <p>To reduce space in object files, executables, etc. and similarly to reduce the number of input symbols to the linker</p>
        <p>To reduce compile time in performing semantic analysis for instantiations whose definitions are provided elsewhere</p>
        <p>To control point-of-instantiation, avoiding contexts where the requisite declarations are not declared</p>
        <p>The special rule around inline functions allows `inline`-ness to be used to indicate that the first reason is the intent and that instantiation-for-inlining is okay.</p>
        <p>Consider the following as a translation unit:</p>
        <pre>
        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        //inline
        void f(T t) { g(t); }
        enum E : int;
        extern template void f(E);
        void h(E e) { f(e); }
        </pre>
        <p>Marking the template definition `inline` would mean that the intended declaration for `g` would need to be provided as the best candidate at the points-of-instantiation for `f&lt;E&gt;`.</p>
        <p>The issue initially points out that this use of the `inline` keyword does not match a view that `inline` is essentially an ODR tool to allow multiple definitions (as opposed to a way to indicate desire for inlining) and proposed that `extern template` merely has the effect of suppressing definitions in terms of linkage (regardless of the `inline` keyword). Such a change would affect the usability of the feature for user intent that falls within the latter two options above.</p>
        <p>I am not sure if CWG is asking EWG a specific question other than the general "we do not believe this is a wording or obvious consistency issue; is this an issue in terms of design?"</p>

        <p>If a std::function has a reference as a return type, and that reference binds to a prvalue returned by the callable that it wraps, then the reference is always dangling.

        <p><b>Tim:</b> LWG in Batavia 2018 would like a way to detect when the initialization of a reference would bind it to a temporary. This requires compiler support, since there's no known way in the current language to do so reliably in the presence of user-defined conversions (see thread starting at <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/07/3256.php"><span>https://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/07/3256.php</span></a>).</p>

          <li><span></span>What would this mean? Is it the alignment of the type of the object? Or the compiler's best guess of the alignment of the expression itself? Should it take into account any facts that are known about the expression other than its type? If so, which ones? (For example, if applied to an expression x or e.x and x is declared with an `alignas` attribute, is that value returned?)</li>

        <p>The current wording of 9.8.1.2 [namespace.memdef] and 13.9.3 [temp.expl.spec] requires that an explicit specialization be declared either in the same namespace as the template or in an enclosing namespace.

        <p>Relaxing <i>exception-specification</i> compatibility requirements</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p>According to 14.5 [except.spec] paragraph 4,</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If any declaration of a function has an exception-specification that is not a noexcept-specification allowing all exceptions, all declarations, including the definition and any explicit specialization, of that function shall have a compatible exception-specification.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>This seems excessive for explicit specializations, considering that paragraph 6 applies a looser requirement for virtual functions:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If a virtual function has an exception-specification, all declarations, including the definition, of any function that overrides that virtual function in any derived class shall only allow exceptions that are allowed by the exception-specification of the base class virtual function.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The rule in paragraph 3 is also problematic in regard to explicit specializations of destructors and defaulted special member functions, as the implicit exception-specification of the template member function cannot be determined.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>There is also a related problem with defaulted special member functions and exception-specifications. According to 9.5.2 [dcl.fct.def.default] paragraph 3,</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If a function that is explicitly defaulted has an explicit exception-specification that is not compatible (14.5 [except.spec]) with the exception-specification on the implicit declaration, then</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span></span>if the function is explicitly defaulted on its first declaration, it is defined as deleted;</li>
          <li><span></span>otherwise, the program is ill-formed.<br>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This rule precludes defaulting a virtual base class destructor or copy/move functions if the derived class function will throw an exception not allowed by the implicit base class member function.</p>

No objection to unanimous consent. We either want to remove entirely, or un-deprecate. This will need a paper, Ville will talk with Alisdair about forking the topic from p2139.</p>

      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p>Although value-initialization is defined for array types and the () initializer is permitted in a mem-initializer naming an array member of a class, the syntax T() (where is an array type) is explicitly forbidden by 7.6.1.3 [expr.type.conv] paragraph 2. This is inconsistent and the syntax should be permitted.</p>
        <p>Rationale (July, 2009): The CWG was not convinced of the utility of this extension, especially in light of questions about handling the lifetime of temporary arrays. This suggestion needs a proposal and analysis by the EWG before it can be considered by the CWG.</p>
        <p>This has become a more severe inconsistency after we adopted Ville's <a href="http://wg21.link/P0960"><span>P0960</span></a> for C++20. Now it's not only () that has this weird special-case restriction, it's (a, b, c) too:</p>

      <td valign="top">
        <p>Currently 13 [temp] paragraph 4 forbids any template from having C linkage. Should alias templates be exempt from this prohibition, since they do not have any linkage?</p>
        <p>Additional note, April, 2013: It was suggested (see messages 23364 through 23367) that relaxing this restriction for alias templates could provide a way of addressing the long-standing lack of a way of specifying a language linkage for a dependent function type (see issue <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg13"><span>13</span></a>). The priority was deleted to allow CWG to consider the implications of that potential application of the facility.</p>
        <p>We should either have some way to express a dependent function type with C language linkage (and should accept <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1555"><span>1555</span></a> below) or we should remove the notion that C language linkage (or not) is part of the function type at all. (Apparently some targets used it; are they still in use? EDG probably knows.)</p>
        <p>Actively discussed on <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/core/2020/04/8823.php"><span>CWG reflector</span></a>.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><b>Davis’ interpretation of CWG discussion</b>:</p>
        <p>I don't speak for Core, of course, but my (Evolutionary) thoughts are those given (last) in the message to which you replied: neither the wording nor the apparent intent of [temp.pre]/6's restrictions on C linkage for templates make any sense.  Since templates (and explicit specializations) can't have C linkage of the name-mangling variety (which the standard calls language linkage of a (function) name) but can have C linkage of the calling-convention variety (which the standard calls language linkage of a (function) type), extern "C" should grant them the latter and not the former with no error.  This has certain obvious applications involving C APIs with callbacks.  (Put differently, CWG13 shouldn't have been rejected; it appears to have gotten bogged down in questions of syntax, but we have an adequate syntactic workaround that we merely have to permit.)</p>
        <p>CWG1463 asks for a (very) proper subset of the above: merely that extern "C" be allowed to apply to alias templates (claiming incorrectly that they have no name with linkage at all).  I consider it more relevant (and more productive) to talk about whether entities have names with language linkage than with the ordinary kind.</p>
        <p>The Core reflector discussion (which seems to have finished for the moment) also touched on the case where "the same" function template is declared with two different language linkages for its type, but the only relevant Evolution input there would be a decision to go the opposite way and forbid function templates from having types with C language linkage entirely.  (They currently can, but it's mostly or entirely useless.)</p>
        <p>If (for CWG1555, also on your list) the rules about language linkage of (function) types are sufficiently relaxed, then CWG1463 may be moot (and my extension of it with it), but that seems unlikely given Hubert's recent identification of a case where they matter.</p>

        <p>Type of __func__</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p>Two questions have arisen regarding the treatment of the type of the __func__ built-in variable. First, some implementations accept</p>
        <p>  void f() {</p>
        <p>    typedef decltype(__func__) T;</p>
        <p>    T x = __func__;</p>
        <p>  }</p>
        <p>even though T is specified to be an array type.</p>
        <p>In a related question, it was noted that __func__ is implicitly required to be unique in each function, and that not only the value but the type of __func__ are implementation-defined; e.g., in something like</p>
        <p>  inline auto f() { return &amp;__func__; }</p>
        <p>the function type is implementation-specific. These concerns could be addressed by making the value a prvalue of type const char* instead of an array lvalue.</p>
        <p>Rationale (November, 2018): See also issue <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg2362"><span>2362</span></a>, which asks for the ability to use __func__ in a constexpr function. These two goals are incompatible.</p>
        <p>The deep question here is about __func__ and the ODR. Does EWG want implementations to somehow behave as if __func__ is the same in all copies of an inline function (in which case it can have an array type and be usable in constant expressions, but the *demangling* algorithm used to construct it becomes part of the ABI), or does EWG want implementations to behave as if __func__ may differ between copies, so is in effect not known until runtime (in which case it must have either pointer or incomplete array type, and its value is not usable in constant expressions -- but its address could still be usable).</p>
        <p>Note: C++20 has std::source_location::function_name.</p>

        <p>Ambiguity resolution for cast to function type</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p><span><a href="http://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21summer2020/CoreWorkingGroup/cwg2228.html?twiki_redirect_cache=5aceede89e9128019e50cb532244e26f">Proposed resolution.</a></span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>C++ has a blanket disambiguation rule that says if a sequence of tokens can be interpreted as either a type-name or an expression, the type-name interpretation is chosen. This is unhelpful in cases like</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>    (T())+3</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>where the current rules make "(T())" a cast to the type "function with no parameters returning T" rather than a parenthesized value-initialization of a temporary of type T. The former interpretation is always ill-formed - you can't cast to a function type - while the latter could be useful.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Richard's proposed resolution, cited above, is to avoid the ambiguity by changing the grammar so that cases like "(T())" cannot be parsed as a cast. The wording in the proposal applies that change to a number of different contexts where the ambiguity can come into play. There are two contexts where the change is _not_ applied, however: 1) the operand of typeid, and 2) a template-argument. During our discussion yesterday, there was some support for the idea of applying the change to typeid, as well, although that would be a breaking change for any programs that rely on the current disambiguation to get type information for such function types. There was general agreement, however, to exclude template arguments, since they are used for things like std::function.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>CWG would, therefore, like some guidance from EWG on two questions. First, should we apply the new syntax to the operand of typeid, even though it's a breaking change?</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>More generally, the question was raised whether we should make this change at all. Although resolving the ambiguity in the other direction would arguably be more convenient in many cases, there is a tension between that convenience and the complexity of the language. In particular, we would be creating a situation where the exact same sequence of tokens would mean two different things, depending on the context in which they appear. Is the convenience worth the cost in complexity?</p>
