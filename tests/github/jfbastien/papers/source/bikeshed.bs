Coloring the shed {#colour}
=================

Thoughtful standards people put significant effort into writing their
papers. Often, too much of that effort goes into <em>style</em> or
<em>format</em> instead of <em>content</em>. This meta-paper is ironically all
style and no C++ content. It proposes that you stop formatting and start using
<a href="https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed">bikeshed</a>.

While we're at it, we'll also propose that you use a public version control
service such as <a href="https://github.com">github</a> to make it easier for
reviewers to see how a paper evolved, both while in draft state as well as from
one revision to another. Final papers are meant to be consumed as-is, but your
paper collaborators, editors, or future-self will thank you when performing
archaeology to untangle the inevitable nonsensical part of your final paper.

To do {#todo}

1. Basics
    - What does the final paper look like?
    - What does the source look like? (see section 4.)
    - Who uses it?
    - Takes care of the boilerplate
2. Convenience
    - Webpages work everywhere
    - Readable offline, no downloads
    - Unicode Just Worksâ„¢ (even the EDG wiki now supports it)
3. Good practice
    - github for diffs: easier to track changes
    - github integration: auto-generation, etc
4. markdown + HTML escape hatch
    - https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/docs/markup.md
    - Railroad diagrams
    - Code, and syntax highlight
    - Toggle diff
5. Link to other papers
6. Getting started
    - Installing https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/docs/install.md
