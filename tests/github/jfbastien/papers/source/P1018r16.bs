Executive summary {#summary}
=================

We have not met in-person since the February 2020 meeting in Prague because of the global pandemic. We're instead holding weekly teleconferences, as detailed in [[P2145R1]]. We focus on providing non-final guidance, and will use electronic straw polls as detailed in [[P2195R0]] to move papers and issues forward in a asynchronous manner.

Our main achievements have been:

* **Issue processing**: most of the 50 language evolution issues have proposed resolutions, and a large number of them have been voted on through electronic polling.
* **C++23**: we've worked on papers for C++23 and later. As of January 2022, EWG is not considering new papers for C++23. As of June 2022, EWG has resolved all feedback it intends to have received from CWG.
* **Incubation**: we've acted as EWG-I and "incubated" some early papers by providing early feedback to authors.

This paper outlines:

* The work achieved in [[#telecons]]; 
* Lists the [[#polls]] June 2022 polling period and explain the [[#process]] (see [[P1018r9]] for the results of the February 2021 polling period, [[P1018r11]] for the results of the May 2021 polling period, [[P1018r13]] for the results of the August polling period, and [[P1018r15]] for the results of the Early 2022 polling period);
* Lists the remaining outstanding issues in [[#issues]], some are still open while others are waiting for polling;
* [[#future]].


Papers of note {#note}
==============

* [[P1000R4]] C++ IS schedule
* [[P0592R4]] To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++23
* [[P1999R0]] Process: double-check evolutionary material via a Tentatively Ready status
* [[P2195R0]] Electronic Straw Polls
* [[P2145R1]] Evolving C++ Remotely


Tentatively ready papers {#tentative}
========================

Following our process in [[P1999R0]], we usually mark papers as tentatively ready for CWG. We would usually take a brief look at the next meeting, and if nothing particular concerns anyone, send them to CWG. However, given the pandemic, we've decided to provide guidance only in virtual teleconferences, and have an asynchronous polling mechanism to officially send papers to CWG or other groups as detailed in [[P2195R0]].

You can follow the lists of papers on GitHub:

* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/TentativelyReady">tentatively ready papers</a>,
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/EWG-vote-on-me">EWG vote on me papers</a>.


Issue Processing {#issue-pro}
================

We've reviewed 50 Language Evolution issues at the Core groups' request, and have tentative resolutions for most. We don't want to poll all of these at the same time, and therefore only poll a subset in each polling period, reserving other issues for later polling periods. We've therefore only polled the "tentatively ready" issues (since they're tied to papers, and polled with said papers, as outlined below), as well as the "resolved" issues since telecon attendees believe that prior work has already addressed the issues.

[[#issues]] contains a list of issues which aren't being voted on in this polling period.


Polls {#polls}
=====

Here are the polls for the June 2022 EWG polling period:

CWG2588 friend declarations and module linkage {#CWG2588}
-------

* <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2588.html">CWG2588</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1253">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** The linkage of friend functions and classes is unclear, if the first (and possibly only) declaration is in a class.
* **🗳  Poll:** A friend's linkage should be affected by the presence/absence of export on the containing class definition itself, but ONLY if the friend is a definition (option #2, modified by Jason's suggestion). This resolves CWG2588.
* **Note:** Jason's suggestion: A friend declaration shouldn't affect linkage if it is not a definition. Exporting definition of class exports "friendliness" but not export of friend function itself.

CWG2586 Explicit object parameter for assignment and comparison {#CWG2586}
-------

* <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2586.html">CWG2586</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1235">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** It's obvious that the situation for comparison operators is a wording oversight, but it's less obvious whether the relaxation of the rules is desirable for copy/move assignment operators, since those are a lot more restricted in the status quo (they can't be friends, for example).
* **🗳  Poll:** Adopt CWG2586's suggested resolution to resolve CWG2586.

P2513 char8_t Compatibility and Portability Fixes {#P2513}
-------

* [[P2513r2]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1171">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** `char8_t` has compatibility problems and issues during deployment that people have had to spend energy working around. This paper aims to alleviate some of those compatibility problems, for both C and C++, around string and character literals for the `char8_t` type.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2513r1 to CWG, with the modification to exclude `signed char` from the allowable conversions list, treat it as a Defect Report against C++20.

CWG2569 Use of `decltype(capture)` in a lambda's parameter-declaration-clause {#CWG2569}
-------

* <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2569.html">CWG2569</a> and <a href="https://wg21.link/D2579R0">D2579R0</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1227">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** [[P2036R3]] (<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/766">GitHub</a>) was approved as a Defect Report, but its changes make popular existing standard library implementations ill-formed. Thus, there is concern about too much breakage, in particular with the "DR" aspect of P2036R3.
* **🗳  Poll:** Accept Option E from D2579R0 as a resolution to CWG2569, which treats all captures as non-`const` for all places before the `mutable` keyword.

CWG2538 Can standard attributes be syntactically ignored? {#CWG2538}
-------

* <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2538.html">CWG2538</a> and [[P2552r0]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1252">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** There is a general notion in C++ that standard attributes should be “ignorable”. However, currently there does not seem to be a common understanding of what this means exactly.
* **🗳  Poll:** Resolve CWG2538 by clarifying that it is EWG's intent that [**dcl.attr**]/6 ONLY permits an implementation to ignore a standard attribute's effect, but not appertainment and argument parsing.

P2460 Relax requirements on `wchar_t` to match existing practices {#P2460}
-------

* [[P2460r1]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1122">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** Remove the constraints put on the encoding associated with `wchar_t` in the core wording, as these constraints do not match existing practice.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P2460r1 "Relax requirements on `wchar_t` to match existing practices" to CWG for C++23, treat it as a Defect Report.

P1854 Conversion to literal encoding should not lead to loss of meaning {#P1854}
-------

* [[P1854r3]]
* <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/608">GitHub issue</a>
* **Highlight:** Make non-encodable characters (characters that cannot be represented in the literal encoding) in character and string literals ill-formed, and restrict the valid characters in a multicharacter literal to avoid visual ambiguity caused by graphemes constituted of multiple code points.
* **🗳  Poll:** Forward P1854r3 "Conversion to literal encoding should not lead to loss of meaning" to CWG for inclusion in C++26.

Polling Process {#process}
===============

For each poll, participants are asked to vote one of:

* Strongly in favor
* In favor
* Neutral
* Against
* Strongly against

Participants also have the option to abstain from voting on a particular poll. They are asked to comment on each poll. This comment is mandatory, as it helps the chair determine consensus.

        <p>If a std::function has a reference as a return type, and that reference binds to a prvalue returned by the callable that it wraps, then the reference is always dangling.

        <p>Davis: the current name lookup approach which Core is taking in p1787 would disallow this. Supporting this is possible, it would be inconsistent, but would also be a feature.</p>

At that point, we can vote on marking the issue as Not a Defect. No objection to unanimous consent.</p>

        <p>Non-`inline` functions and explicit instantiation declarations</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p><b>Hubert:</b> question over the role of the `inline` keyword in relation to explicit instantiation declarations.</p>
        <p>For `inline` functions, explicit instantiation declarations do not have the effect of suppressing implicit instantiation.</p>
        <p>A user's desire for wanting to suppress implicit instantiation can arise for different reasons:</p>
        <p>To reduce space in object files, executables, etc. and similarly to reduce the number of input symbols to the linker</p>
        <p>To reduce compile time in performing semantic analysis for instantiations whose definitions are provided elsewhere</p>
        <p>To control point-of-instantiation, avoiding contexts where the requisite declarations are not declared</p>
        <p>The special rule around inline functions allows `inline`-ness to be used to indicate that the first reason is the intent and that instantiation-for-inlining is okay.</p>
        <p>Consider the following as a translation unit:</p>
        <pre>
        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        //inline
        void f(T t) { g(t); }
        enum E : int;
        extern template void f(E);
        void h(E e) { f(e); }
        </pre>
        <p>Marking the template definition `inline` would mean that the intended declaration for `g` would need to be provided as the best candidate at the points-of-instantiation for `f<E>`.</p>
        <p>The issue initially points out that this use of the `inline` keyword does not match a view that `inline` is essentially an ODR tool to allow multiple definitions (as opposed to a way to indicate desire for inlining) and proposed that `extern template` merely has the effect of suppressing definitions in terms of linkage (regardless of the `inline` keyword). Such a change would affect the usability of the feature for user intent that falls within the latter two options above.</p>
        <p>I am not sure if CWG is asking EWG a specific question other than the general "we do not believe this is a wording or obvious consistency issue; is this an issue in terms of design?"</p>
        <p><b>Meeting:</b></p>

        <p>According to 14.5 [except.spec] paragraph 4,</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If any declaration of a function has an exception-specification that is not a noexcept-specification allowing all exceptions, all declarations, including the definition and any explicit specialization, of that function shall have a compatible exception-specification.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>This seems excessive for explicit specializations, considering that paragraph 6 applies a looser requirement for virtual functions:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If a virtual function has an exception-specification, all declarations, including the definition, of any function that overrides that virtual function in any derived class shall only allow exceptions that are allowed by the exception-specification of the base class virtual function.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The rule in paragraph 3 is also problematic in regard to explicit specializations of destructors and defaulted special member functions, as the implicit exception-specification of the template member function cannot be determined.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>There is also a related problem with defaulted special member functions and exception-specifications. According to 9.5.2 [dcl.fct.def.default] paragraph 3,</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If a function that is explicitly defaulted has an explicit exception-specification that is not compatible (14.5 [except.spec]) with the exception-specification on the implicit declaration, then</p>

          <li><span></span>if the function is explicitly defaulted on its first declaration, it is defined as deleted;</li>
          <li><span></span>otherwise, the program is ill-formed.<br>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This rule precludes defaulting a virtual base class destructor or copy/move functions if the derived class function will throw an exception not allowed by the implicit base class member function.</p>

        <p>Although value-initialization is defined for array types and the () initializer is permitted in a mem-initializer naming an array member of a class, the syntax T() (where is an array type) is explicitly forbidden by 7.6.1.3 [expr.type.conv] paragraph 2. This is inconsistent and the syntax should be permitted.</p>
        <p>Rationale (July, 2009): The CWG was not convinced of the utility of this extension, especially in light of questions about handling the lifetime of temporary arrays. This suggestion needs a proposal and analysis by the EWG before it can be considered by the CWG.</p>
        <p>This has become a more severe inconsistency after we adopted Ville's <a href="http://wg21.link/P0960"><span>P0960</span></a> for C++20. Now it's not only () that has this weird special-case restriction, it's (a, b, c) too:</p>

      <td valign="top">
        <p>Currently 13 [temp] paragraph 4 forbids any template from having C linkage. Should alias templates be exempt from this prohibition, since they do not have any linkage?</p>
        <p>Additional note, April, 2013: It was suggested (see messages 23364 through 23367) that relaxing this restriction for alias templates could provide a way of addressing the long-standing lack of a way of specifying a language linkage for a dependent function type (see issue <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg13"><span>13</span></a>). The priority was deleted to allow CWG to consider the implications of that potential application of the facility.</p>
        <p>We should either have some way to express a dependent function type with C language linkage (and should accept <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1555"><span>1555</span></a> below) or we should remove the notion that C language linkage (or not) is part of the function type at all. (Apparently some targets used it; are they still in use? EDG probably knows.)</p>
        <p>Actively discussed on <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/core/2020/04/8823.php"><span>CWG reflector</span></a>.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><b>Davis’ interpretation of CWG discussion</b>:</p>
        <p>I don't speak for Core, of course, but my (Evolutionary) thoughts are those given (last) in the message to which you replied: neither the wording nor the apparent intent of [temp.pre]/6's restrictions on C linkage for templates make any sense.  Since templates (and explicit specializations) can't have C linkage of the name-mangling variety (which the standard calls language linkage of a (function) name) but can have C linkage of the calling-convention variety (which the standard calls language linkage of a (function) type), extern "C" should grant them the latter and not the former with no error.  This has certain obvious applications involving C APIs with callbacks.  (Put differently, CWG13 shouldn't have been rejected; it appears to have gotten bogged down in questions of syntax, but we have an adequate syntactic workaround that we merely have to permit.)</p>
        <p>CWG1463 asks for a (very) proper subset of the above: merely that extern "C" be allowed to apply to alias templates (claiming incorrectly that they have no name with linkage at all).  I consider it more relevant (and more productive) to talk about whether entities have names with language linkage than with the ordinary kind.</p>
        <p>The Core reflector discussion (which seems to have finished for the moment) also touched on the case where "the same" function template is declared with two different language linkages for its type, but the only relevant Evolution input there would be a decision to go the opposite way and forbid function templates from having types with C language linkage entirely.  (They currently can, but it's mostly or entirely useless.)</p>
        <p>If (for CWG1555, also on your list) the rules about language linkage of (function) types are sufficiently relaxed, then CWG1463 may be moot (and my extension of it with it), but that seems unlikely given Hubert's recent identification of a case where they matter.</p>

        <p>Type of __func__</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p>Two questions have arisen regarding the treatment of the type of the __func__ built-in variable. First, some implementations accept</p>
        <p>  void f() {</p>
        <p>    typedef decltype(__func__) T;</p>
        <p>    T x = __func__;</p>
        <p>  }</p>
        <p>even though T is specified to be an array type.</p>
        <p>In a related question, it was noted that __func__ is implicitly required to be unique in each function, and that not only the value but the type of __func__ are implementation-defined; e.g., in something like</p>
        <p>  inline auto f() { return &amp;__func__; }</p>
        <p>the function type is implementation-specific. These concerns could be addressed by making the value a prvalue of type const char* instead of an array lvalue.</p>
        <p>Rationale (November, 2018): See also issue <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg2362"><span>2362</span></a>, which asks for the ability to use __func__ in a constexpr function. These two goals are incompatible.</p>
        <p>The deep question here is about __func__ and the ODR. Does EWG want implementations to somehow behave as if __func__ is the same in all copies of an inline function (in which case it can have an array type and be usable in constant expressions, but the *demangling* algorithm used to construct it becomes part of the ABI), or does EWG want implementations to behave as if __func__ may differ between copies, so is in effect not known until runtime (in which case it must have either pointer or incomplete array type, and its value is not usable in constant expressions -- but its address could still be usable).</p>
        <p>Note: C++20 has std::source_location::function_name.</p>

        <p>Ambiguity resolution for cast to function type</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <p><span><a href="http://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21summer2020/CoreWorkingGroup/cwg2228.html?twiki_redirect_cache=5aceede89e9128019e50cb532244e26f">Proposed resolution.</a></span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>C++ has a blanket disambiguation rule that says if a sequence of tokens can be interpreted as either a type-name or an expression, the type-name interpretation is chosen. This is unhelpful in cases like</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>    (T())+3</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>where the current rules make "(T())" a cast to the type "function with no parameters returning T" rather than a parenthesized value-initialization of a temporary of type T. The former interpretation is always ill-formed - you can't cast to a function type - while the latter could be useful.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Richard's proposed resolution, cited above, is to avoid the ambiguity by changing the grammar so that cases like "(T())" cannot be parsed as a cast. The wording in the proposal applies that change to a number of different contexts where the ambiguity can come into play. There are two contexts where the change is _not_ applied, however: 1) the operand of typeid, and 2) a template-argument. During our discussion yesterday, there was some support for the idea of applying the change to typeid, as well, although that would be a breaking change for any programs that rely on the current disambiguation to get type information for such function types. There was general agreement, however, to exclude template arguments, since they are used for things like std::function.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>CWG would, therefore, like some guidance from EWG on two questions. First, should we apply the new syntax to the operand of typeid, even though it's a breaking change?</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>More generally, the question was raised whether we should make this change at all. Although resolving the ambiguity in the other direction would arguably be more convenient in many cases, there is a tension between that convenience and the complexity of the language. In particular, we would be creating a situation where the exact same sequence of tokens would mean two different things, depending on the context in which they appear. Is the convenience worth the cost in complexity?</p>

        <p>Ville <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/ext/2020/05/13733.php"><span>emailed EWG about this</span></a>.</p>
        <p>JF contacted Andrzej to see if he’s interested in addressing this. Not sure he is.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><b>Meeting 2020-10-28</b>: Tomasz will write a paper which exposes the issue and what he thinks should be done (but not resolving wording itself). Hubert remembers an email about this, will find it and sync with JF.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><b>Meeting 2021-01-14:</b> Andrzej wrote a paper for this (<a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/ext/2021/01/15505.php"><span>emailed 2021-01-12 to EWG</span></a>).</p>

        <p>The definition of __func__ in 9.5.1 [dcl.fct.def.general] paragraph 8 is:</p>
        <p>  static const char __func__[] = "function-name";</p>
        <p>This prohibits its use in constant expressions, e.g.,</p>
        <p>  int main () {</p>
        <p>    // error: the value of __func__ is not usable in a constant expression</p>
        <p>    constexpr char c = __func__[0];</p>
        <p>  }</p>
        <p>Rationale (November, 2018): See also issue <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1962"><span>1962</span></a>, which asks that the type of __func__ be const char*. These two goals are incompatible.</p>
