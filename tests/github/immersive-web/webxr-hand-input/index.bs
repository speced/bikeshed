Introduction {#intro}
============

<section class="non-normative">
On some [=/XR devices=] it is possible to get fully articulated information about the user's hands when they are used as input sources.

This API exposes the poses of each of the users' hand [=skeleton joints=]. This can be used to do gesture detection or to render a hand model in VR scenarios.

</section>


Initialization {#initialization}
==============

If an application wants to view articulated hand pose information during a session,
the session MUST be requested with an appropriate [=feature descriptor=]. The string "<dfn for="feature descriptor">hand-tracking</dfn>" is introduced
by this module as a new valid [=feature descriptor=] for articulated hand tracking.

The "[=hand-tracking=]" [=feature descriptor=] should only be granted for an {{XRSession}} when its [=XRSession/XR device=] has [=physical hand input sources=] that [=support hand tracking=].

The user agent MAY gate support for hand based {{XRInputSource|XRInputSources}} based upon this [=feature descriptor=].

NOTE: This means that if an {{XRSession}} does not request the "[=hand-tracking=]" [=feature descriptor=], the user agent may choose to not support input controllers that are hand based.

Physical Hand Input Sources {#physical-hand}
===========================

An {{XRInputSource}} is a <dfn>physical hand input source</dfn> if it tracks a physical hand. A [=physical hand input source=] <dfn>supports hand tracking</dfn> if it supports reporting the poses of one or more [=skeleton joints=] defined in this specification.

[=Physical hand input sources=] MUST include the [=XRInputSource/input profile name=] of "generic-hand-select" in their {{XRInputSource/profiles}}.

For many [=physical hand input sources=], there can be overlap between the gestures used for the [=primary action=] and the squeeze action. For example, a pinch gesture may indicate both a "select" and "squeeze" event, depending on whether you are interacting with nearby or far away objects. Since content may assume that these are independent events, user agents MAY, instead of surfacing the squeeze action as the [=primary squeeze action=], surface it as an additional "grasp button", using an input profile derived from the "generic-hand-select-grasp" profile.

XRInputSource {#xrinputsource-interface}
-------------

<pre class="idl">
partial interface XRInputSource {
   [SameObject] readonly attribute XRHand? hand;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=XRInputSource>hand</dfn> attribute on a [=physical hand input source=] that [=supports hand tracking=] will be an {{XRHand}} object giving access to the underlying hand-tracking capabilities. {{XRInputSource/hand}} will have its [=input source=] set to [=this=].

If the {{XRInputSource}} belongs to an {{XRSession}} that has not been requested with the "[=hand-tracking=]" [=feature descriptor=], {{XRInputSource/hand}} MUST be <code>null</code>.

Skeleton Joints {#skeleton-joints-section}
---------------

A [=physical hand input source=] is made up of many <dfn>skeleton joints</dfn>.

A [=skeleton joint=] for a given hand can be uniquely identified by a <dfn>skeleton joint name</dfn>, which is an enum of type {{XRHandJoint}}.

A [=skeleton joint=] may have an <dfn>associated bone</dfn> that it is named after and used to orient its <code>-Z</code> axis. The [=associated bone=] of a [=skeleton joint=] is the bone that comes after the joint when moving towards the fingertips. The tip and wrist joints have no [=associated bones=].

A [=skeleton joint=] has a <dfn for="skeleton joint">radius</dfn> which is the radius of a sphere placed at its center so that it roughly touches the skin on both sides of the hand. The "tip" [=skeleton joints=] SHOULD have an appropriate nonzero radius so that collisions with the fingertip may work. Implementations MAY offset the origin of the tip joint so that it can have a spherical shape with nonzero radius.

This <dfn>list of joints</dfn> defines the following [=skeleton joints=] and their order:

<table class="tg">

</pre>

The {{XRHandJoint}} enum defines the various joints that each {{XRHand}} MUST contain.

Every {{XRHand}} has an associated <dfn for=XRHand>input source</dfn>, which is the [=physical hand input source=] that it tracks.

<div algorithm="XRHand.[[joints]]">
    Each {{XRHand}} object has a <dfn attribute for="XRHand">\[[joints]]</dfn> internal slot,
    which is an [=ordered map=] of pairs with the key of type {{XRHandJoint}} and the value of type {{XRJointSpace}}.

    The ordering of the {{[[joints]]}} internal slot is given by the [=list of joints=] under [=skeleton joints=].

    {{[[joints]]}} MUST NOT change over the course of a session.
</div>

<div algorithm="XRHand.iterator">
    The [=value pairs to iterate over=] for an {{XRHand}} object are the list of [=value pairs=] with the key being
    the {{XRHandJoint}} and the value being the {{XRJointSpace}} corresponding to that {{XRHandJoint}}, ordered by [=list of joints=]
    under [=skeleton joints=].
</div>

If an individual device does not support a joint defined in this specification, it MUST emulate it instead.

The <dfn attribute for=XRHand>size</dfn> attribute MUST return the number <code>25</code>.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="index-joint-space">
The <dfn method for="XRHand">get(|jointName|)</dfn> method when invoked on an {{XRHand}} [=this=] MUST run the following steps:

  1. Let |joints| be the value of [=this=]'s {{[[joints]]}} internal slot.
  2. Return |joints|[|jointName|]. (This implies returning <code>undefined</code> for unknown |jointName|.)

</div>

XRJointSpace {#xrjointspace-interface}
-------------

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface XRJointSpace: XRSpace {
  readonly attribute XRHandJoint jointName;
};
</pre>

The [=native origin=] of an {{XRJointSpace}} is the position and orientation of the underlying [=XRJointSpace/joint=].

The [=native origin=] of the {{XRJointSpace}} may only be reported when [=native origins=] of all other {{XRJointSpace}}s on the same [=XRJointSpace/hand=] are being reported. When a hand is partially obscured the user agent MUST either emulate the obscured joints, or report null poses for all of the joints.

Note: This means that when fetching poses you will either get an entire hand or none of it.

Issue: This by default precludes faithfully exposing polydactyl/oligodactyl hands, however for fingerprinting concerns it will likely need to be a separate opt-in, anyway. See <a href=https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-hand-input/issues/11>Issue 11</a> for more details.

The [=native origin=] has its <code>-Y</code> direction pointing perpendicular to the skin, outwards from the palm, and <code>-Z</code> direction pointing along their associated bone, away from the wrist.

For tip [=skeleton joints=] where there is no [=associated bone=], the <code>-Z</code> direction is the same as that for the associated distal joint, i.e. the direction is along that of the previous bone. For wrist [=skeleton joints=] the <code>-Z</code> direction SHOULD point roughly towards the center of the palm.

Every {{XRJointSpace}} has an associated <dfn for=XRJointSpace>hand</dfn>, which is the {{XRHand}} that created it.

<dfn for=XRJointSpace>jointName</dfn> returns the joint name of the joint it tracks.

Every {{XRJointSpace}} has an associated <dfn for=XRJointSpace>joint</dfn>, which is the [=skeleton joint=] corresponding to the [=XRJointSpace/jointName=].


Frame Loop {#frame-loop}
==========

XRFrame {#xrframe-interface}
-------

<pre class="idl">
partial interface XRFrame {
    XRJointPose? getJointPose(XRJointSpace joint, XRSpace baseSpace);
    boolean fillJointRadii(sequence&lt;XRJointSpace&gt; jointSpaces, Float32Array radii);

    boolean fillPoses(sequence&lt;XRSpace&gt; spaces, XRSpace baseSpace, Float32Array transforms);
};
</pre>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="get-joint-pose">

The <dfn method for="XRFrame">getJointPose(XRJointSpace |joint|, XRSpace |baseSpace|)</dfn> method provides the pose of |joint| relative to |baseSpace| as an {{XRJointPose}}, at the {{XRFrame}}'s [=XRFrame/time=].

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

  1. Let |frame| be [=this=].
  1. Let |session| be |frame|'s {{XRFrame/session}} object.
  1. If |frame|'s [=active=] boolean is <code>false</code>, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. If |baseSpace|'s [=XRSpace/session=] or |joint|'s [=XRSpace/session=] are different from [=this=] {{XRFrame/session}}, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. Let |pose| be a [=new=] {{XRJointPose}} object in the [=relevant realm=] of |session|.
  1. [=Populate the pose=] of |joint| in |baseSpace| at the time represented by |frame| into |pose|, with <code>force emulation</code> set to <code>false</code>.
  1. If |pose| is <code>null</code> return <code>null</code>.
  1. Set |pose|'s {{XRJointPose/radius}} to the [=skeleton joint/radius=] of |joint|, emulating it if necessary.
  1. Return |pose|.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="fill-joint-radii">

The <dfn method for="XRFrame">fillJointRadii(sequence&lt;XRJointSpace&gt; |jointSpaces|, Float32Array |radii|)</dfn> method populates |radii| with the radii of the |jointSpaces|, and returns a boolean indicating whether all of the spaces have a valid pose.

When this method is invoked on an {{XRFrame}} |frame|, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

  1. Let |frame| be [=this=].
  1. Let |session| be |frame|'s {{XRFrame/session}} object.
  1. If |frame|'s [=active=] boolean is <code>false</code>, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. For each |joint| in the |jointSpaces|:
    1. If |joint|'s [=XRSpace/session=] is different from |session|, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. If the length of |jointSpaces| is larger than the number of elements in |radii|, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
  1. let |offset| be a new number with the initial value of <code>0</code>.
  1. Let |allValid| be <code>true</code>.
  1. For each |joint| in the |jointSpaces|:
    1. Set the float value of |radii| at |offset| as follows:
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt> If the user agent can determine the poses of all the joints belonging to the |joint|'s [=XRJointSpace/hand=]:
            <dd> Set the float value of |radii| at |offset| to that [=skeleton joint/radius=].
          <dt> Otherwise
            <dd> Set the float value of |radii| at |offset| to <code>NaN</code>.
            <dd> Set |allValid| to <code>false</code>.
        </dl>
    1. Increase |offset| by <code>1</code>.
  1. Return |allValid|.

</div>

NOTE: if the user agent can't determine the pose of any of the spaces belonging to the same {{XRHand}}, all the spaces of that {{XRHand}} must also not have a pose.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="fill-poses">

The <dfn method for="XRFrame">fillPoses(sequence&lt;XRSpace&gt; |spaces|, XRSpace |baseSpace|, Float32Array |transforms|)</dfn> method populates |transforms| with the matrices of the poses of the |spaces| relative to the |baseSpace|, and returns a boolean indicating whether all of the spaces have a valid pose.

When this method is invoked on an {{XRFrame}} |frame|, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

  1. Let |frame| be [=this=].
  1. Let |session| be |frame|'s {{XRFrame/session}} object.
  1. If |frame|'s [=active=] boolean is <code>false</code>, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. For each |space| in the |spaces| sequence:
    1. If |space|'s [=XRSpace/session=] is different from |session|, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. If |baseSpace|'s [=XRSpace/session=] is different from |session|, throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
  1. If the length of |spaces| multiplied by <code>16</code> is larger than the number of elements in |transforms|, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
  1. let |offset| be a new number with the initial value of <code>0</code>.
  1. Initialize |pose| as follows:
    <dl class="switch">
      <dt> If {{XRFrame/fillPoses()}} was called previously, the user agent MAY:
        <dd> Let |pose| be the same object as used by an earlier call.
      <dt> Otherwise
        <dd> Let |pose| be a [=new=] {{XRPose}} object in the [=relevant realm=] of |session|.
    </dl>
  1. Let |allValid| be <code>true</code>.
  1. For each |space| in the |spaces| sequence:
    1. [=Populate the pose=] of |space| in |baseSpace| at the time represented by |frame| into |pose|.
    1. If |pose| is <code>null</code>, perform the following steps:
      1. Set <code>16</code> consecutive elements of the |transforms| array starting at |offset| to <code>NaN</code>.
      1. Set |allValid| to <code>false</code>.
    1. If |pose| is not <code>null</code>, copy all elements from |pose|'s {{XRRigidTransform/matrix}} member to the |transforms| array starting at |offset|.
    1. Increase |offset| by <code>16</code>.
  1. Return |allValid|.

</div>

NOTE: if any of the spaces belonging to the same {{XRHand}} return <code>null</code> when [=Populate the pose|populating the pose=], all the spaces of that {{XRHand}} must also return <code>null</code> when [=Populate the pose|populating the pose=]

XRJointPose {#xrjointpose-interface}
-----------

An {{XRJointPose}} is an {{XRPose}} with additional information about the size of the [=skeleton joint=] it represents.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface XRJointPose: XRPose {
    readonly attribute float radius;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=XRJointPose>radius</dfn> attribute returns the [=skeleton joint/radius=] of the [=skeleton joint=] in meters.

The user-agent MUST set {{XRJointPose/radius}} to an emulated value if the [=/XR device=] does not have the capability of determining this value, either in general or in the current [=XRSession/animation frame=] (e.g. when the [=skeleton joint=] is partially obscured).

Privacy & Security Considerations {#privacy-security}
=================================
The WebXR Hand Input API is a powerful feature that carries significant privacy risks.

Since this feature returns new sensor data, the User Agent MUST ask for [=explicit consent=] from the user at session creation time.

Data returned from this API, MUST NOT be so specific that one can detect individual users.
If the underlying hardware returns data that is too precise, the User Agent MUST anonymize this data
before revealing it through the WebXR Hand Input API.

This API MUST only be supported in XRSessions created with XRSessionMode of {{XRSessionMode/"immersive-vr"}}
or {{XRSessionMode/"immersive-ar"}}. {{XRSessionMode/"inline"}} sessions MUST not support this API.

<div class="note">
When anonymizing the hands data, the UA can follow these guidelines:
 * Noising is discouraged in favour of rounding.
 * If the UA uses rounding, each joint must not be rounded independently. Instead the correct way to round is to map each hand to a static hand-model.
 * If noising, the noised data must not reveal any information over time:
    - Each new WebXR session in the same [=browsing context=] must use the same noise to make sure that the data cannot be de-noised by creating multiple sessions.
    - Each new [=browsing context=] must use a different noise vector.
    - Any seed used to initialize the noise must not be predictable.
 * Anonymization must be done in a trusted environment.
