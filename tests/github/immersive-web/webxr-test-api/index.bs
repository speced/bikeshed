Introduction {#intro}
============

<section class="non-normative">

In order to allow <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a> for WebXR there are some basic functions which are common across all tests, such as adding a fake test device and specifying poses. Below is an API which attempts to capture the necessary functions, based off what was defined in the spec. Different browser vendors can implement this API in whatever way is most compatible with their browser. For example, some browsers may back the interface with a WebDriver API while others may use HTTP or IPC mechanisms to communicate with an out of process fake backend.


These initialization object and control interfaces do not represent a complete set of WebXR functionality, and are expected to be expanded on as the WebXR spec grows.

</section>


Conformance {#conformance}
============

Interfaces and functionality exposed by this specification SHOULD NOT be exposed to typical browsing experiences, and instead SHOULD only be used when running <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a>.



Simulated devices {#simulated-devices}
============

Simulated XR Device {#simulated-devices-xr}
------------
This API gives tests the ability to spin up a <dfn>simulated XR device</dfn> which is an [=/XR device=] which from the point of view of the WebXR API behaves like a normal [=/XR device=]. These [=simulated XR device|simulated XR devices=] can be controlled by the associated {{FakeXRDevice}} object.

Every [=simulated XR device=] may have an <dfn for="simulated XR device">native bounds geometry</dfn> which is an array of {{DOMPointReadOnly}}s, used to initialize the [=XRBoundedReferenceSpace/native bounds geometry=] of any {{XRBoundedReferenceSpace}}s created for the device. If <code>null</code>, the device is treated as if it is not currently tracking a bounded reference space.

Every [=simulated XR device=] may have a <dfn for="simulated XR device">floor origin</dfn> which is an {{XRRigidTransform}} used to note the position of the physical floor. If <code>null</code>, the device is treated as if it is unable to identify the physical floor.

Every [=simulated XR device=] may have an <dfn for="simulated XR device">viewer origin</dfn> which is an {{XRRigidTransform}} used to set the position and orientation of the [=viewer=]. If <code>null</code>, the device is treated as if it has lost tracking.

Every [=simulated XR device=] has an <dfn for="simulated XR device">emulated position boolean</dfn> which is a boolean used to set the {{XRPose/emulatedPosition}} of any {{XRPose}}s produced involving the [=viewer=]. This is initially <code>false</code>.

Every [=simulated XR device=] has an <dfn for="simulated XR device">visibility state</dfn> which is an {{XRVisibilityState}} used to set the {{XRSession/visibilityState}} of any {{XRSession}}s associated with the [=simulated XR device=] . This is initially {{XRVisibilityState/"visible"}}. When it is changed, the associated changes must be reflected on the {{XRSession}}, including triggering {{XRSession/onvisibilitychange}} events if necessary.

Every [=simulated XR device=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR device">list of primary views</dfn> which is a list of [=view|views=] that must be rendered to for an immersive experience. There must be at least one primary view.

Every [=simulated XR device=] may have a <dfn for="simulated XR device">list of secondary views</dfn> which is a list of [=view|views=] that may or may not be rendered to. There may be any number of secondary views.

Every [=view=] for a [=simulated XR device=] has an associated <dfn for=view>device resolution</dfn>, which is an instance of {{FakeXRDeviceResolution}}. This resolution must be used when constructing {{XRViewport}} values for the [=view=], based on the canvas size.

Every [=view=] for a [=simulated XR device=] may have an associated <dfn for=view>field of view</dfn>, which is an instance of {{FakeXRFieldOfViewInit}} used to calculate projection matrices using depth values. If the [=field of view=] is set, projection matrix values are calculated using the [=field of view=] and {{XRRenderState/depthNear}} and {{XRRenderState/depthFar}} values.

Simulated Input Device {#simulated-devices-input}
------------

This API gives tests the ability to spin up a <dfn>simulated XR input source</dfn> which is an [=/XR input source=] which from the point of view of the WebXR API behaves like a normal [=/XR input source=]. These [=simulated XR input source|simulated XR input sources=] can be controlled by the associated {{FakeXRInputController}} object.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">handedness</dfn> which is an {{XRHandedness}} value that MUST be returned for the corresponding [=/XR input source|XR input source's=] {{XRInputSource/handedness}} attribute.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">targetRayMode</dfn> which is an {{XRTargetRayMode}} value that MUST be returned for the corresponding [=/XR input source|XR input source's=] {{XRInputSource/targetRayMode}} attribute.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">pointerOrigin</dfn> which is an {{XRRigidTransform}} used to note the origin of the {{XRInputSource/targetRaySpace}}.

A [=simulated XR input source=] may have a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">gripOrigin</dfn> which is an {{XRRigidTransform}} used to note the origin of the {{XRInputSource/gripSpace}}. If this is <code>null</code> the [=simulated XR input source=] is not tracked.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">profiles</dfn> array which is an array of {{DOMString}}s which MUST be returned for the corresponding [=/XR input source|XR input source's=] {{XRInputSource/profiles}} attribute.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">buttonState</dfn> array which is an array of {{FakeXRButtonStateInit}}s. If a {{FakeXRButtonType/"grip"}} button is specified, it SHOULD drive the [=/primary squeeze action=]. If a UA implements the <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-gamepads-module/">WebXR Gamepads Module</a> [=buttonState=] SHOULD be used to set the state for the corresponding [=/XR input source|XR input source's=] {{XRInputSource/gamepad}} object, which SHOULD be of type {{GamepadMappingType/"xr-standard"}} if enough buttons are specified to support it.

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">connectionState</dfn> which is a boolean that is initially <code>true</code> and indicates whether the associated [=/XR input source=] should appear in {{XRSession/inputSources}}. When it is changed the associated changes must be reflected on the XRSession, including triggering the {{XRSession/inputsourceschange}} event if necessary by the [=next animation frame=].

Every [=simulated XR input source=] has a <dfn for="simulated XR input source">primaryActionStarted</dfn> which is a boolean, initially set to <code>false</code>, that indicates whether or not the primary action of the XR input source has been started.

Initialization {#initialization}
==============

navigator.xr.test {#xr-test-attribute}
------------


<script type="idl">
partial interface XRSystem {
    [SameObject] readonly attribute XRTest test;
};
</script>

The <dfn attribute for="XRSystem">test</dfn> attribute's getter MUST return the {{XRTest}} object that is associated with it. This object MAY be lazily created.


XRTest {#xrtest-interface}
------------

The {{XRTest}} object is the entry point for all testing.

<script type="idl">
interface XRTest {
  Promise<FakeXRDevice> simulateDeviceConnection(FakeXRDeviceInit init);
  undefined simulateUserActivation(Function f);
  Promise<undefined> disconnectAllDevices();
};
</script>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="simulate-device-connection">
The <dfn method for="XRTest">simulateDeviceConnection(|init|)</dfn> method creates a new [=simulated XR device=].

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

  1. Let |promise| be [=a new Promise=].
  1. Run the following steps [=in parallel=]:
    1. Let |device| be a new [=simulated XR device=].
    1. For each |view| in |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/views}}:
        1. Let |p| be the result of running [=parse a view=] on |view|.
        1. If running [=parse a view=] threw an error, reject |promise| with this error and abort these steps.
        1. [=list/Append=] |p| to |device|'s [=simulated XR device/list of primary views=].
    1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/secondaryViews}} is set, for each |secondaryView| in |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/secondaryViews}}:
        1. Let |s| be the result of running [=parse a view=] on |secondaryView|.
        1. If running [=parse a view=] threw an error, reject |promise| with this error and abort these steps.
        1. [=list/Append=] |s| to |device|'s [=simulated XR device/list of secondary views=].
    1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/boundsCoordinates}} is set, perform the following steps:
        1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/boundsCoordinates}} has less than 3 elements, reject |promise| with {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
        1. Set |device|'s [=simulated XR device/native bounds geometry=] to |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/boundsCoordinates}}.
    1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/floorOrigin}} is set, set |device|'s [=simulated XR device/floor origin=] to |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/floorOrigin}}.
    1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/viewerOrigin}} is set, set |device|'s [=simulated XR device/viewer origin=] to |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/viewerOrigin}}.
    1. Let |supportedModes| be an empty list of {{XRSessionMode}}s.
    1. Modify |supportedModes| as follows:
        <dl class="switch">
        <dt>If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/supportedModes}} is present:</dt>
        <dd>
            1. Append the contents of |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/supportedModes}} to |supportedModes|.
            1. If |supportedModes| is empty, append <code>"inline"</code> to it.
        </dd>
        <dt>Else</dt>
        <dd>
            1. Append <code>"inline"</code> to |supportedModes|.
            1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/supportsImmersive}} is <code>true</code>, append <code>"immersive-vr"</code> to |supportedModes|.
        </dd>
        </dl>
    1. If |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/supportedFeatures}} is set, for each |mode| in |supportedModes|:
       1. Associate |init|'s {{FakeXRDeviceInit/supportedFeatures}} to |mode|

NOTE: each |device| stores a [=capable of supporting|list of features it is capable of supporting=] per {{XRSessionMode}}. Most tests only test one mode anyway so there isn't much to be gained by splitting features per mode in {{FakeXRDeviceInit}}. Users wishing different modes supporting different features should create multiple devices instead.

    1. Set |device|'s [=list of supported modes=] to |supportedModes|.
    1. Register |device| based on the following:
        1. If |supportedModes| contains <code>"immersive-vr"</code> or <code>"immersive-ar"</code>, append |device| to the {{Navigator/xr}}'s [=list of immersive XR devices=].
        1. If |supportedModes| contains <code>"inline"</code>, set the [=inline XR device=] to |device|.
    1. Let |d| be a new {{FakeXRDevice}} object with [=FakeXRDevice/device=] as |device|.
    1. [=/Resolve=] |promise| with |d|.
  1. Return |promise|.

</div>

When <dfn method for=XRTest>simulateUserActivation(f)</dfn> is called, invoke <code>f</code> as if it had [=transient activation=].


When <dfn method for=XRTest>disconnectAllDevices()</dfn> is called, remove all [=simulated XR devices=] from the {{Navigator/xr}}'s [=list of immersive XR devices=] as if they were disconnected. If the [=inline XR device=] is a [=simulated XR device=], reset it to the default [=inline XR device=].

FakeXRRigidTransformInit {#fakexrrigidtransform-base-space}
------------
The WebXR API never exposes native origins directly, instead exposing transforms between them, so we need to specify a <dfn>base reference space</dfn> for {{FakeXRRigidTransformInit}}s so that we can have consistent numerical values across implementations. When used as an origin, {{FakeXRRigidTransformInit}}s are in the [=base reference space=] where the [=viewer=]'s [=native origin=] is identity at initialization, unless otherwise specified. In this space, the {{XRReferenceSpaceType/"local"}} reference space has a [=native origin=] of identity. This is an arbitrary choice: changing this reference space doesn't affect the data returned by the WebXR API, but we must make such a choice so that the tests produce the same results across different UAs. When used as an origin it is logically a transform <i>from</i> the origin's space <i>to</i> the underlying [=base reference space=] described above.

Mocking {#mocking}
==============

FakeXRDevice {#fakexrdevice-interface}
------------

<script type="idl">
interface FakeXRDevice : EventTarget {

</script>


Each {{FakeXRDevice}} object has an associated <dfn for=FakeXRDevice>device</dfn>, which is a [=simulated XR device=] that it is able to control.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="next-animation-frame">

Operations on the {{FakeXRDevice}}'s [=FakeXRDevice/device=] typically take place on the <dfn for=XRSession>next animation frame</dfn>, i.e. they are not immediately observable until a future {{XRSession/requestAnimationFrame()}} callback.

To determine when this frame is, for a given operation, choose a frame based on the following:

    <dl class=switch>
    <dt>If such an operation is triggered within an [=XR animation frame=]:</dt>
    <dd>Choose the next [=XR animation frame=], whenever it may occur</dd>
    <dt>If such an operation is triggered outside of an [=XR animation frame=]:</dt>
    <dd>Choose either the next or next-to-next [=XR animation frame=]. The precise choice is up to the user agent and may be dependent on the exact timing of these events.
    </dd>
    </dl>

NOTE: The reason we defer an extra frame when there are pending animation frame callbacks is to avoid having to deal with potential race conditions when the device is ready to trigger an animation frame callback, but has not yet. In practice, this means that tests should be written so that they wait until they have performed all such operations <i>before</i> calling the next {{XRSession/requestAnimationFrame()}}, and in case they are running outside of an [=XR animation frame=], should always wait two frames before expecting any updates to take effect.

Each {{FakeXRInputController}} object has an associated <dfn for="FakeXRInputController">inputSource</dfn>, which is a [=simulated XR input source=] that it is able to control.

Since user agents may opt to send input events on a per-frame basis, the results of all {{FakeXRInputController}} methods and {{FakeXRDevice/simulateInputSourceConnection()}} are not guaranteed to be visible (via, e.g. {{XRSession/inputSources}} or {{XRSession/oninputsourceschange}} events) until the [=next animation frame=].

Hit test extensions {#hit-test-extensions}
===================

The hit test extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/hit-test/">WebXR Hit Test Module</a>.

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRWorldInit {
  required sequence<FakeXRRegionInit> hitTestRegions;
};
</script>

{{FakeXRWorldInit}} dictionary describes the state of the world that will be used when computing hit test results on a {{FakeXRDevice}}.

{{FakeXRWorldInit/hitTestRegions}} contains a collection of {{FakeXRRegionInit}}s that are used to describe specific regions of the fake world. The order of the regions does not matter.

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRRegionInit {
  required sequence<FakeXRTriangleInit> faces;
  required FakeXRRegionType type;
};
</script>

{{FakeXRRegionInit}} dictionary describes the contents of a specific region of the world.

{{FakeXRRegionInit/faces}} contains a collection of {{FakeXRTriangleInit}}s that enumerate all the faces contained by the region. The order of the faces does not matter.

{{FakeXRRegionInit/type}} contains a type of the region that will be used during computation of hit test results.

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRTriangleInit {
  required sequence<DOMPointInit> vertices;  // size = 3
};
</script>

{{FakeXRTriangleInit}} dictionary describes a single face of a region.

{{FakeXRTriangleInit/vertices}} contains a collection of {{DOMPointInit}}s that comprise the face. The face will be considered as solid when computing hit test results and as such, the winding order of the vertices does not matter.

<script type="idl">
enum FakeXRRegionType {
  "point",
  "plane",
  "mesh"
};
</script>

{{FakeXRRegionType}} enum is used to describe a type of the world region.


DOM overlay extensions {#dom-overlay-extensions}
======================

The DOM Overlay extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/dom-overlays/">WebXR DOM Overlay Module</a>.

<script type="idl">
partial interface FakeXRInputController {
  undefined setOverlayPointerPosition(float x, float y);
};
</script>

When <dfn method for=FakeXRInputController>setOverlayPointerPosition(x, y)</dfn> is called, it sets a position within the DOM overlay in DOM coordinates for the next [=XR animation frame=], and is cleared after that frame. It is intended to be used along with a [=primary action=] for that frame, simulating that the user is interacting with the DOM overlay. The UA will emit a [=beforexrselect=] event at this location before generating XR select events.

Anchors extensions {#anchors-extensions}
==================

The anchors extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/anchors/">WebXR Anchors</a>.

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRAnchorCreationParameters {
  FakeXRRigidTransformInit requestedAnchorOrigin;
  boolean isAttachedToEntity;
};

callback FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback = Promise<boolean> (FakeXRAnchorCreationParameters parameters, FakeXRAnchorController anchorController);

partial interface FakeXRDevice {
  undefined setAnchorCreationCallback(FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback? callback);
};
</script>

The {{FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback}} callback can be used by the Web Platform Tests to control the result of a call to create an anchor, and to be able to subsequently control the newly created anchor.

The {{FakeXRDevice}} interface is extended with internal <dfn for="FakeXRDevice">anchorCreationCallback</dfn>, initially set to <code>null</code>. When the device receives a request to create an anchor, it MUST run the [=determine if the anchor creation succeeded=] algorithm.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="determine-if-anchor-creation-succeded">

In order to <dfn>determine if the anchor creation succeeded</dfn>, the {{FakeXRDevice}} |device| MUST run the following steps:
1. If the |device|'s [=FakeXRDevice/anchorCreationCallback=] is <code>null</code>, return <code>false</code> and abort these steps.
1. Let |promise| be the result of invoking [=FakeXRDevice/anchorCreationCallback=] with parameters set so that they reflect the parameters passed to anchor creation request.
1. [=React=] to |promise|:
    - If |promise| was fulfilled with value |v|, then return |v| and abort these steps.
    - If |promise| was rejected, then return <code>false</code> and abort these steps.

</div>

The WPTs can set the anchor creation callback by calling {{FakeXRDevice/setAnchorCreationCallback(callback)}}.

The {{FakeXRAnchorCreationParameters/requestedAnchorOrigin}} attribute represents a transform expressed relative to [=base reference space=] used by the device.

The {{FakeXRAnchorCreationParameters/isAttachedToEntity}} attribute will be set to <code>true</code> if the created anchor should be treated as attached to some entity. If so, the tests could emulate entity changing location by appropriately controlling the anchor via [=FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback/anchorController=].

The <dfn for=FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback>anchorController</dfn> parameter passed in to {{FakeXRAnchorCreationCallback}} can be used to update the state of the anchor, assuming that the creation request was deemed successful. Tests SHOULD store it and issue commands to it for the entire duration of controlled anchor's lifetime.

<script type="idl">
interface FakeXRAnchorController {
  readonly attribute boolean deleted;

  // Controlling anchor state:
  undefined pauseTracking();
  undefined resumeTracking();
  undefined stopTracking();

  // Controlling anchor location:
  undefined setAnchorOrigin(FakeXRRigidTransformInit anchorOrigin);
};
</script>

Successfully created anchors can be controlled by the test through the use of {{FakeXRAnchorController}} interface.

The {{FakeXRAnchorController}} has an associated internal <dfn for=FakeXRAnchorController>anchor origin</dfn>, which is a {{FakeXRRigidTransformInit}} describing the current state of the anchor's [=XRAnchor/native origin=].

The {{FakeXRAnchorController/deleted}} attribute will be set to <code>true</code> when the application has invoked an {{XRAnchor/delete()}} method on the anchor - in that case, the changes to the fake anchor controller will be ignored.

The {{FakeXRAnchorController/pauseTracking()}} method can be used by the tests to signal that the controlled anchor is temporarily untracked (i.e. its location will be unknown). Calling this method does not modify [=FakeXRAnchorController/anchor origin=] of the controller.

The {{FakeXRAnchorController/resumeTracking()}} method can be used by the tests to signal that the controlled anchor should have its tracking resumed, if it was temporarily untracked. Calling this method does not modify [=FakeXRAnchorController/anchor origin=] of the controller.

The {{FakeXRAnchorController/stopTracking()}} method can be used by the tests to signal that the controlled anchor is no longer tracked and that anchor tracking will not be resumed. After calling this method, the other calls on anchor controller will be ignored.

The {{FakeXRAnchorController/setAnchorOrigin(anchorOrigin)}} method can be used to set the controller's [=FakeXRAnchorController/anchor origin=]. Tests can use this method to simulate updates in anchor pose.

Lighting estimation extensions {#lighting-estimation-extensions}
==================

The lighting estimation extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/lighting-estimation/">WebXR Lighting Estimation</a>.

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRLightEstimateInit {
  required sequence<float> sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients;
  DOMPointInit primaryLightDirection;
  DOMPointInit primaryLightIntensity;
};

partial interface FakeXRDevice {
  undefined setLightEstimate(FakeXRLightEstimateInit init);
};
</script>

The {{FakeXRDevice}} is extended with internal <dfn for=FakeXRDevice>light estimate</dfn> which is a {{FakeXRLightEstimateInit}}, used to supply data for any requested {{XRLightEstimate}}.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="set-light-estimate">
When the <dfn method for="FakeXRDevice">setLightEstimate(|init|)</dfn> method is invoked on {{FakeXRDevice}} |device|, run the following steps:

  1. Let |c| be |init|'s {{FakeXRLightEstimateInit/sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients}}.
  1. If |c| does not have 27 elements, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
  1. Let |d| be |init|'s {{FakeXRLightEstimateInit/primaryLightDirection}}.
  1. If |d| is set and |d|'s {{DOMPointInit/w}} value does not equal <code>0</code>, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
  1. Let |i| be |init|'s {{FakeXRLightEstimateInit/primaryLightIntensity}}.
  1. If |i| is set and |i|'s {{DOMPointInit/w}} value does not equal <code>1</code>, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
  1. Set |device|'s [=FakeXRDevice/light estimate=] to |init| by the [=next animation frame=].

</div>

Depth sensing extensions {#depth-sensing-extensions}
========================

The depth sensing extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/depth-sensing/">WebXR Depth Sensing Module</a>.

The {{FakeXRDevice}} is extended with internal <dfn for=FakeXRDevice>depth sensing data</dfn> which is a {{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit}}, used to supply data for requests to [=native depth sensing=].

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit {
  required ArrayBuffer depthData;
  required FakeXRRigidTransformInit normDepthBufferFromNormView;
  required float rawValueToMeters;
  required unsigned long width;
  required unsigned long height;
};
</script>

{{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit}} dictionary describes the state of the depth sensing data that should be used when returning latest depth information in [=creating a CPU depth information instance=] and [=creating a GPU depth information instance=] algorithms. All keys present in {{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit}} correspond to the data required to be returned by [=native depth sensing=] capabilities of the device.

{{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/depthData}} corresponds to the desired depth buffer that is to be set on native depth information returned from querying the native device. Not setting {{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/depthData}} key in the dictionary signals that the returned native depth information should be <code>null</code>.

{{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/normDepthBufferFromNormView}} corresponds to the desired [=depth coordinates transformation matrix=] that is to be set on native depth information returned from querying the native device.

{{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/rawValueToMeters}} corresponds to the desired conversion factor that is to be set on native depth information returned from querying the native device.

{{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/width}} and {{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/height}} correspond to the desired dimensions of the depth buffer that are to be set on native depth information returned from querying the native device.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="set-depth-sensing-information">

When the {{FakeXRDevice/setDepthSensingData()}} method is invoked on {{FakeXRDevice}} |device| with |depthSensingData|, run the following steps:

1. If |depthSensingData|'s {{FakeXRDepthSensingDataInit/depthData}} is <code>null</code>, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
1. Set |device|'s [=FakeXRDevice/depth sensing data=] to |depthSensingData|.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="clear-depth-sensing-information">

When the {{FakeXRDevice/clearDepthSensingData()}} method is invoked on {{FakeXRDevice}} |device|, run the following steps:

1. Set |device|'s [=FakeXRDevice/depth sensing data=] to <code>null</code>.

</div>

Raw camera access extensions {#raw-camera-access-extensions}
============================

The raw camera access extensions for test API SHOULD be implemented by all user agents that implement <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/raw-camera-access/">WebXR Raw Camera Access Module</a>.

The {{FakeXRViewInit}} dictionary is extended with {{FakeXRViewInit/cameraImageInit}} dictionary of type {{FakeXRDeviceResolution}}. This dictionary carries information about the camera image, and is intended to affect the <code>camera image</code> variable in [=obtain camera=] algorithm. If the {{FakeXRViewInit/cameraImageInit}} key is not present in the {{FakeXRViewInit}} dictionary, the [=obtain camera=] algorithm should treat this as <code>null</code> camera image (and thus the algorithm will return <code>null</code>).

<script type="idl">
dictionary FakeXRCameraImage {
  required long width;
  required long height;

  Uint32Array pixels;
};
</script>

The {{FakeXRCameraImage/width}} controls the width of the camera image buffer in [=obtain camera=] algorithm.

The {{FakeXRCameraImage/height}} controls the height of the camera image buffer in [=obtain camera=] algorithm.

The {{FakeXRCameraImage/pixels}} control the camera image contents in [=obtain camera=] algorithm. The pixels will be used to initialize the camera image texture.

The camera image will be initialized as if by a call to <code>gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, width, height, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels)</code>, where <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>pixels</code> are, respectively, {{FakeXRCameraImage/width}}, {{FakeXRCameraImage/height}}, and {{FakeXRCameraImage/pixels}}. In case {{FakeXRCameraImage/pixels}} key is not present in the dictionary, the behavior would be as if a call to <code>gl.texImage2D()</code> variant that omits the <code>pixels</code> parameter was made.

Any time a [=simulated XR device=]'s [=simulated XR device/list of primary views=] and [=simulated XR device/list of secondary views=] is set, the user agent MUST verify that the camera images associated with the views present across both of those lists are all equal to each other. Camera images are considered equal when their {{FakeXRCameraImage/width}}s and {{FakeXRCameraImage/height}}s are equal, and their {{FakeXRCameraImage/pixels}} are the same instance (if present). If they are not equal, the user agent MUST throw an error from within the algorithm that attempted to set them.
