Introduction {#intro}
============

<section class="non-normative">

This module describes a mechanism for allowing WebXR applications to cast rays into the users' real world environment and report back, to the best of the XR device's knowledge, the point at which the ray intersected with a physical object along with the orientation of the intersected surface. This allows for virtual objects to be placed in alignment with those surfaces, such as placing objects realistically on the floor or attaching them to a wall. The hit test API is an extension to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/">WebXR Device API</a> and builds on top of <a href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/">WebXR Augmented Reality Module</a>.

</section>

Terminology {#terminology}
-----------

Hit testing, as understood by this document, is an act of checking if an idealised mathematical ray (half-line) intersects with real world as understood by the underlying Augmented Reality hardware & software. Ray intersections against virtual objects created by the application consuming the API are explicitly out of scope of the hit test API.

Initialization {#hit-test-initialization}
==============

Feature descriptor {#hit-test-feature-descriptor}
------------------

In order for the applications to signal their interest in performing hit testing during a session, the session must be requested with appropriate [=feature descriptor=]. The string <dfn>hit-test</dfn> is introduced by this module as a new valid feature descriptor for hit test feature.

A device is [=capable of supporting=] the hit test feature if the device exposes a [=native hit test=] capability. The [=inline XR device=] MUST NOT be treated as [=capable of supporting=] the hit test feature.

The hit test feature is subject to [=feature policy=] and requires <code>"xr-spatial-tracking"</code> policy to be allowed on the requesting document's origin.

Hit test options {#hit-test-options}
================

XRHitTestTrackableType {#hit-test-trackable-type-enum}
----------------------

<section class="unstable">

An {{XRHitTestTrackableType}} enum specifies the type of entity that can be used for the purposes of hit test source creation.

<script type="idl">
enum XRHitTestTrackableType {
  "point",
  "plane",
  "mesh"
};
</script>

- A hit test trackable of type <dfn enum-value for="XRHitTestTrackableType">"point"</dfn> indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the feature points detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.
- A hit test trackable of type <dfn enum-value for="XRHitTestTrackableType">"plane"</dfn> indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the planes detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.
- A hit test trackable of type <dfn enum-value for="XRHitTestTrackableType">"mesh"</dfn> indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the meshes detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.

</section>

XRHitTestOptionsInit {#hit-test-options-dictionary}
--------------------

An {{XRHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary represents a set of configurable values that affect the behavior of the hit test being performed.

<script type="idl">
dictionary XRHitTestOptionsInit {
  required XRSpace space;
  FrozenArray<XRHitTestTrackableType> entityTypes;
  XRRay offsetRay;
};
</script>

The <dfn dict-member for="XRHitTestOptionsInit">space</dfn> dictionary member specifies {{XRSpace}} relative to which the {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} is specified.

<section class="unstable">
The <dfn dict-member for="XRHitTestOptionsInit">entityTypes</dfn> dictionary member specifies array of <a enum lt="XRHitTestTrackableType">XRHitTestTrackableTypes</a> that will be used to compute results of the hit test.
</section>

The <dfn dict-member for="XRHitTestOptionsInit">offsetRay</dfn> dictionary member specifies {{XRRay}} that will be used to perform hit test. The {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} will be interpreted as if expressed in a coordinate system defined by {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/space}}.

<section class="unstable">
The {{XRHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestOptionsInit">effective entityTypes</dfn> which is set to {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/entityTypes}} if it was provided at dictionary construction time. If the {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/entityTypes}} was not provided at construction time, the [=XRHitTestOptionsInit/effective entityTypes=] is set to an array containing single element, {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"plane"}}.
</section>

The {{XRHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestOptionsInit">effective offsetRay</dfn> which is set to {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} if it was provided at dictionary construction time. If the {{XRHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} was not provided at construction time, the [=XRHitTestOptionsInit/effective offsetRay=] is set to an {{XRRay}} constructed by invoking {{XRRay/XRRay()}} without any parameters.

XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit {#transient-input-hit-test-options-dictionary}
----------------------------------

An {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary represents a set of configurable values that affect the behavior of the hit test for transient input that is being performed.

<script type="idl">
dictionary XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit {
  required DOMString profile;
  FrozenArray<XRHitTestTrackableType> entityTypes;
  XRRay offsetRay;
};
</script>

The <dfn dict-member for="XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit">profile</dfn> dictionary member specifies an [=XRInputSource/input profile name=] of the transient input source that will be used to compute hit test results.

<section class="unstable">
The <dfn dict-member for="XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit">entityTypes</dfn> dictionary member specifies array of <a enum lt="XRHitTestTrackableType">XRHitTestTrackableTypes</a> that will be used to compute results of the hit test.
</section>

The <dfn dict-member for="XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit">offsetRay</dfn> dictionary member specifies {{XRRay}} that will be used to perform hit test. The {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} will be interpreted as if expressed in a coordinate system defined by {{XRInputSource}} whose profile matches the passed in {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/profile}} when computing hit test results for transient input sources.

<section class="unstable">
The {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary has an associated <dfn for="XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit">effective entityTypes</dfn> which is set to {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/entityTypes}} if it was provided at dictionary construction time. If the {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/entityTypes}} was not provided at construction time, the [=XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/effective entityTypes=] is set to an array containing single element, {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"plane"}}.
</section>

The {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit}} dictionary has an associated <dfn for="XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit">effective offsetRay</dfn> which is set to {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} if it was provided at dictionary construction time. If the {{XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/offsetRay}} was not provided at construction time, the [=XRTransientInputHitTestOptionsInit/effective offsetRay=] is set to an {{XRRay}} constructed by invoking {{XRRay/XRRay()}} without any parameters.

Hit test source {#hit-test-source}
===============

XRHitTestSource {#hit-test-source-interface}
---------------

<script type="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRHitTestSource {
  undefined cancel();
};
</script>

The {{XRHitTestSource}} object serves as a handle to an active subscription to hit test.

Each {{XRHitTestSource}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestSource">session</dfn> which stores an {{XRSession}} that was used to create the hit test source.

Each {{XRHitTestSource}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestSource">native origin</dfn> which stores information sufficient to identify the [=XRSpace/native origin=] of an {{XRSpace}} that was used to [=request hit test=]. This information will be subsequently used when computing hit test results.

<section class="unstable">
Each {{XRHitTestSource}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestSource">entity types</dfn>, which is an array of <a enum lt="XRHitTestTrackableType">XRHitTestTrackableTypes</a> describing which entity types will be considered when computing hit test results.
</section>

Each {{XRHitTestSource}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestSource">offset ray</dfn>, which is an {{XRRay}} that will be used when computing hit test results.

{{XRHitTestSource}} is considered <dfn for="XRHitTestSource">active</dfn> for as long as it's present in [=XRHitTestSource/session=]'s [=XRSession/set of active hit test sources=].

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="create-hit-test-source">

In order to <dfn>create a hit test source</dfn> from |session|, |space|, |entityTypes| and |offsetRay|, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
    1. Let |hitTestSource| be a new {{XRHitTestSource}}.
    1. Initialize |hitTestSource|'s [=XRHitTestSource/session=] to |session|.
    1. Initialize |hitTestSource|'s [=XRHitTestSource/native origin=] to |space|'s [=XRSpace/native origin=].

    1. Compute |transformedOffsetRay| from |offsetRay| and |space| such that |transformedOffsetRay|, when interpreted in |space|'s [=XRSpace/native origin=] coordinate system, represents the same ray as |offsetRay| does when interpreted in |space|'s [=effective origin=] coordinate system.
    1. Initialize |hitTestSource|'s [=XRHitTestSource/offset ray=] to |transformedOffsetRay|.
    1. Return |hitTestSource|.

</div>

The <dfn method for="XRHitTestSource">cancel()</dfn> method, when invoked on {{XRHitTestSource}} |hitTestSource|, signals that the application is no longer interested in obtaining hit test results for the specified |hitTestSource|.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="cancel-hit-test-source">

    1. Remove |hitTestSource| from [=XRHitTestSource/session=]'s [=XRSession/set of active hit test sources=].

</div>

When the application no longer retains any references to a particular {{XRHitTestSource}} <var>hitTestSource</var>, the user agent MAY [=cancel a hit test source=] if <var>hitTestSource</var> is still [=XRHitTestSource/active=]. The cancelation MAY happen at an unspecified time (or not at all) and the application SHOULD NOT rely on this behavior for cleanup.

---------------

<script type="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRHitTestResult {
  XRPose? getPose(XRSpace baseSpace);
};
</script>

A {{XRHitTestResult}} contains single result of a hit test. It encapsulates information about the intersection point of the ray used to perform the hit test with user's environment as understood by the underlying [=XR device=].

Each {{XRHitTestResult}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestResult">frame</dfn> which is an {{XRFrame}} for which the result was computed.

Each {{XRHitTestResult}} has an associated <dfn for="XRHitTestResult">native origin</dfn>. This native origin defines new coordinate system whose Y axis represents the surface's normal vector at the intersection point.

Native device concepts {#native-device-concepts} 
======================

<section class="non-normative">

User agents implementing hit test API must have a way of obtaining information about user's environment from underlying XR device. This section attempts to describe requirements and concepts related to native capabilities of the device and is by neccesity sufficiently under-specified to leave ample room for different underlying frameworks / devices.

</section>

Native hit test {#native-hit-test-section}
---------------

In this specification it is assumed that [=/XR device=] exposes a way for the user agent to perform a <dfn>native hit test</dfn> that satisfies the following requirements:
- Accepts a 3D ray that will be tested against user's environment.
- Returns a collection of 3D poses representing intersection points of the passed in ray with user's environment. Each entry in the collection should also contain information about the type of the native entity that was used to obtain that native result and enough information to enable the user agent to compute surface normal to the user's environment at the intersection point.

Note: For devices that do not expose the hit test functionality natively, it might still be possible for user agents to implement this specification by leveraging other ways of obtaining the information about user's environment that might be exposed by the XR device.

Native entity type {#native-entity-type-section}
------------------
<section class="unstable">
[=Native hit test results=] returned by [=XR device=] should contain information about the <dfn lt="native entity type">type of the entity</dfn> used to compute the result. Such native types might consist of, but not be limited to:
- Point - signifies that hit test result was computed based on characteristic points found in user's environment.
- Plane - signifies that hit test result was computed based on planes detected in user's environment.
- Mesh - signifies that the hit test result was computed based on meshes detected in user's environment.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="convert-native-type-to-trackable-type">

To <dfn>convert from native entity type</dfn> into {{XRHitTestTrackableType}}, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
  1. Let |nativeEntityType| be the native entity type to be converted.
  1. Let |entityType| be a new {{XRHitTestTrackableType}}.
  1. Initialize |entityType| as follows:
    <dl class="switch">
      <dt>If |nativeEntityType| contains type that corresponds to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"point"}}</dt>
      <dd>Set |entityType| to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"point"}}.</dd>
      <dt>Else, if |nativeEntityType| contains type that corresponds to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"plane"}}</dt>
      <dd>Set |entityType| to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"plane"}}.</dd>
      <dt>Else, if |nativeEntityType| contains type that corresponds to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"mesh"}}</dt>
      <dd>Set |entityType| to {{XRHitTestTrackableType/"mesh"}}.</dd>
      <dt>Else</dt>
      <dd>Set |entityType| to <code>null</code></dd>
    </dl>
  1. Return |entityType|.

</div>
</section>

Native hit test result {#native-hit-test-result-section}
----------------------

<dfn lt="native hit test result|native hit test results">Native hit test results</dfn> returned from XR device should contain the position of the intersection point with user's environment. Depending on the native entity type and the information available to the XR device, the result should also contain orientation defined in such a way to allow the user agent to compute a surface normal to the user's environment at the intersection point.

The information about position and orientation of the intersection point should be contained in [=native hit test result=]'s native origin. Native origin defines a new coordinate system in such a way that its Y axis represents the surface's normal vector at the intersection point. If the orientation is not returned from the XR device, the user agent SHOULD set the native origin in such a way that Y axis of the coordinate system it defines is pointing up (towards negative gravity vector).

Issue: Decide if we need to specify other axes of the coordinate system defined by hit test result's native origin to maintain compatibility between different implementations & differrent AR frameworks.

Privacy & Security Considerations {#privacy-security}
=================================

<section class="non-normative">

The hit test API can be used to map the user environment with more or less
precision by sending hit test rays in multiple directions. Hit test has to be
declared when creating an XR session as a [=feature descriptor=] which will
allow the user agent to notify the user of the potential privacy implications of
allowing the hit test API to be used by the website. Furthermore, the user agent
is allowed to deny hit test requests when it considers that an [=unreasonable
number of requests=] have been made for a genuine non-privacy invasive usage.
