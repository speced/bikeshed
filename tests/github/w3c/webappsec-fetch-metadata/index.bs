Abstract:
    This document defines a set of Fetch metadata request headers that aim to provide servers with
    enough information to make <i lang="la">a priori</i> decisions about whether or not to service
    a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

Interesting web applications generally end up with a large number of web-exposed endpoints that
might reveal sensitive data about a user, or take action on a user's behalf. Since users' browsers
can be easily convinced to make requests to those endpoints, and to include the users' ambient
credentials (cookies, privileged position on an intranet, etc), applications need to be very careful
about the way those endpoints work in order to avoid abuse.

Being careful turns out to be hard in some cases ("simple" CSRF), and practically impossible in
others (cross-site search, timing attacks, etc). The latter category includes timing attacks based
on the server-side processing necessary to generate certain responses, and length measurements (both
via web-facing timing attacks and passive network attackers).

It would be helpful if servers could make more intelligent decisions about whether or not to respond
to a given request based on the way that it's made in order to mitigate the latter category. For
example, it seems pretty unlikely that a "Transfer all my money" endpoint on a bank's server would
expect to be referenced from an <{img}> tag, and likewise unlikely that `evil.com` is going to be
making any legitimate requests whatsoever. Ideally, the server could reject these requests
<i lang="la">a priori</i> rather than delivering them to the application backend.

Here, we describe a mechanims by which user agents can enable this kind of decision-making by
adding additional context to outgoing requests. By delivering metadata to a server in a set of
[=fetch metadata headers=], we enable applications to quickly reject requests based on testing a
set of preconditions. That work can even be lifted up above the application layer (to reverse
proxies, CDNs, etc) if desired.

Examples {#examples}
--------------------

A request generated by a <{picture}> element would result in a request containing the following
HTTP request headers:

```
Sec-Fetch-Dest: image
Sec-Fetch-Mode: no-cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site
```

A top-level navigation from `https://example.com` to `https://example.com/` caused by a user's click
on an in-page link would result in a request containing the following HTTP request header:

```
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
```

Fetch Metadata Headers {#framework}
===================================

The following sections define several <dfn export>fetch metadata headers</dfn>, each of which
exposes an interesting [=request=] attribute to a server.

The `Sec-Fetch-Dest` HTTP Request Header {#sec-fetch-dest-header}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The <dfn http-header export>`Sec-Fetch-Dest`</dfn> HTTP request header exposes a [=request=]'s
[=request/destination=] to a server. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose value MUST be a
[=structured header/token=]. [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]] Its ABNF is:

```
Sec-Fetch-Dest = sh-token
```

Valid `Sec-Fetch-Dest` values include "`audio`", "`audioworklet`", "`document`", "`embed`",
"`empty`", "`font`", "`frame`", "`iframe`", "`image`", "`manifest`", "`object`", "`paintworklet`",
"`report`", "`script`", "`serviceworker`", "`sharedworker`", "`style`", "`track`", "`video`",
"`worker`", "`xslt`".

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#948): `frame` and `iframe` haven't landed in Fetch yet.

In order to support forward-compatibility with as-yet-unknown request types, servers SHOULD ignore
this header if it contains an invalid value.

<pre class="example">
// `fetch()`'s destination is the empty string:
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty

// `<img>`'s destination is "image"
Sec-Fetch-Dest: image

// `new Worker()`'s destination is "worker"
Sec-Fetch-Dest: worker

// Top-level navigations' destinations are "document"
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document

// `<iframe>` navigations' destinations are "iframe"
Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe
</pre>

<div algorithm="set `Sec-Fetch-Dest`">
To <dfn abstract-op lt="set-dest">set the `Sec-Fetch-Dest` header</dfn> for a [=request=] |r|:

<ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Assert: |r|'s [=request/url=] is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

    2.  Let |header| be a [=Structured Header=] whose value is a [=structured header/token=].

    3.  If |r|'s [=request/destination=] is the empty string, set |header|'s value to the string
        "`empty`". Otherwise, set |header|'s value to |r|'s [=request/destination=].
       
        Note: We map Fetch's empty string [=request/destination=] onto an explicit "`empty`"
        [=structured header/token=] in order to simplify processing.

    4.  [=header list/Set a structured field value=]
        &#96;<a http-header>`Sec-Fetch-Dest`</a>&#96;/|header| in |r|'s [=request/header list=].
</div>



The `Sec-Fetch-Mode` HTTP Request Header {#sec-fetch-mode-header}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The <dfn http-header export>`Sec-Fetch-Mode`</dfn> HTTP request header exposes a [=request=]'s
[=request/mode=] to a server. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose value is a
[=structured header/token=]. [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]] Its ABNF is:

```
Sec-Fetch-Mode = sh-token
```

Valid `Sec-Fetch-Mode` values include "`cors`", "`navigate`", "`no-cors`", "`same-origin`",
and "`websocket`". In order to support forward-compatibility with as-yet-unknown request types,
servers SHOULD ignore this header if it contains an invalid value.

<div algorithm="set `Sec-Fetch-Mode`">
To <dfn abstract-op lt="set-mode">set the `Sec-Fetch-Mode` header</dfn> for a [=request=] |r|:

<ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Assert: |r|'s [=request/url=] is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

    2.  Let |header| be a [=Structured Header=] whose value is a [=structured header/token=].

    3.  Set |header|'s value to |r|'s [=request/mode=].

    4.  [=header list/Set a structured field value=]
        &#96;<a http-header>`Sec-Fetch-Mode`</a>&#96;/|header| in |r|'s [=request/header list=].
</ol>
</div>


The `Sec-Fetch-Site` HTTP Request Header {#sec-fetch-site-header}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The <dfn http-header export>`Sec-Fetch-Site`</dfn> HTTP request header exposes the relationship
between a [=request=] initiator's origin and its target's origin. It is a [=Structured Header=]
whose value is a [=structured header/token=]. [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]] Its ABNF is:

```
Sec-Fetch-Site = sh-token
```

Valid `Sec-Fetch-Site` values include "`cross-site`", "`same-origin`", "`same-site`", and "`none`".
In order to support forward-compatibility with as-yet-unknown request types, servers SHOULD ignore
this header if it contains an invalid value.

<div algorithm="set `Sec-Fetch-Site`">
To <dfn abstract-op lt="set-site">set the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header</dfn> for a [=request=] |r|:

<ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Assert: |r|'s [=request/url=] is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

    2.  Let |header| be a [=Structured Header=] whose value is a [=structured header/token=].

    3.  Set |header|'s value to `same-origin`.

    4.  If |r| is a [=navigation request=] that was explicitly caused by a user's interaction with
        the user agent (by typing an address into the user agent directly, for example, or by
        clicking a bookmark, etc.), then set |header|'s value to `none`.

        Note: See [[#directly-user-initiated]] for more detail on this somewhat poorly-defined step.

    5.  If |header|'s value is not `none`, then for each |url| in |r|'s [=request/url list=]:

        1.  If |url| is [=same origin=] with |r|'s [=request/origin=], [=iteration/continue=].

        2.  Set |header|'s value to `cross-site`.
        
        3.  If |r|'s [=request/origin=] is not [=same site=] with |url|'s [=url/origin=], then [=iteration/break=].

        4.  Set |header|'s value to `same-site`.

    6.  [=header list/Set a structured field value=]
        &#96;<a http-header>`Sec-Fetch-Site`</a>&#96;/|header| in |r|'s [=request/header list=].
</ol>
</div>


The `Sec-Fetch-User` HTTP Request Header {#sec-fetch-user-header}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The <dfn http-header export>`Sec-Fetch-User`</dfn> HTTP request header exposes whether or not a
[=navigation request=] was triggered by user activation. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose
value is a [=structured header/boolean=]. [[!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]] Its ABNF is:

```
Sec-Fetch-User = sh-boolean
```

Note: The header is delivered only for [=navigation requests=], and only when its value is `true`.
It might be reasonable to expand the headers' scope in the future to include subresource requests
generally if we can spell out some use cases that would be improved by exposing that information
(and if we can agree on ways to define that status for all the subresource request types we'd be
interested in), but for the moment, navigation requests have clear use cases, and seem
straightforward to define interoperably.

<div algorithm="set `Sec-Fetch-User`">
To <dfn abstract-op lt="set-user">set the `Sec-Fetch-User` header</dfn> for a [=request=] |r|:

<ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Assert: |r|'s [=request/url=] is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

    2.  If |r| is not a [=navigation request=], or if |r|'s [=request/user activation=] is
        `false`, return.

    3.  Let |header| be a [=Structured Header=] whose value is a [=structured header/token=].

    4.  Set |header|'s value to `true`.

    5.  [=header list/Set a structured field value=]
        &#96;<a http-header>`Sec-Fetch-User`</a>&#96;/|header| in |r|'s [=request/header list=].
</ol>
</div>


Integration with Fetch and HTML {#fetch-integration}
===========================================

To support `Sec-Fetch-User`, [=request=] needs to be taught about requests which were
triggered by user activation:

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[FETCH]]:</strong>
>
>   A [=request=] has a boolean <dfn for="request">user activation</dfn>. Unless stated
>   otherwise, it is `false`.
>
>   Note: This is only used for [=navigation requests=].

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#993): This should be defined in Fetch.

This flag could be populated from HTML's [=process a navigate fetch=] algorithm, perhaps by
inserting the following step after the current algorithm's step 2:

>   <strong>Monkeypatching [[HTML]]:</strong>
>
>   3.  If <var ignore>sourceBrowsingContext</var>'s {{WindowProxy}}'s `[[Window]]` value has
>       [=transient activation=], then set <var ignore>request</var>'s [=request/user activation=] to true.

ISSUE(whatwg/html#5203): This should be defined in HTML.

<div algorithm="append fetch metadata headers">
To <dfn abstract-op export>append the Fetch metadata headers for a request</dfn>, given [=request=] |r|:

<ol class="algorithm">
    1.  If |r|'s [=request/url=] is not an [=potentially trustworthy URL=], return.

    2.  <a abstract-op lt='set-dest'>Set the `Sec-Fetch-Dest` header</a> for |r|.

    3.  <a abstract-op lt='set-mode'>Set the `Sec-Fetch-Mode` header</a> for |r|.

    4.  <a abstract-op lt='set-site'>Set the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header</a> for |r|.

    5.  <a abstract-op lt='set-user'>Set the `Sec-Fetch-User` header</a> for |r|.
</ol>
</div>

Fetch will call into the algorithm above from within its "HTTP-network-or-cache fetch" algorithm.
Please consult that specification for integration details [[!FETCH]].

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#993): This should be called from in Fetch.

Security and Privacy Considerations {#sec-priv-considerations}
==============================================================

Redirects {#redirects}
----------------------

The user agent will send a <a http-header>`Sec-Fetch-Site`</a> header along with each request in a
redirect chain. The header's value will shift in the presence of cross-origin or cross-site
redirection in order to mitigate confusion.

The algorithm to <a abstract-op lt='set-site'>set the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header</a> walks the [=request=]'s entire
[=request/url list=], and will send `cross-site` if any URL in the list is cross-site to the
request's [=request/current url=], `same-site` only if all URLs in the list are same-site with the
request's [=request/current url=], and `same-origin` only if all URLs in the list are same-origin
with the request's [=request/current url=].

For example, if `https://example.com/` requests `https://example.com/redirect`, the initial
request's `Sec-Fetch-Site` value would be `same-origin`. If that response redirected to
`https://subdomain.example.com/redirect`, that request's `Sec-Fetch-Site` value would be
`same-site` (as `https://subdomain.example.com/` and `https://example.com/` have the same
registrable domain). If that response redirected to `https://example.net/redirect`, that
request's `Sec-Fetch-Site` value would be `cross-site` (as `https://example.net/` is not
same-site with `https://example.com/` and `https://subdomain.example.com/`). If that response
redirects all the way back to `https://example.com/`, the final request's `Sec-Fetch-Site`
value would still be `cross-site` (as the redirect chain includes `https://example.net/`, which is
still not same-site with the other URLs.

The `Sec-` Prefix {#sec-prefix}
-------------------------------

Each of the headers defined in this document is prefixed with `Sec-`, which makes them all
[=forbidden header names=], and therefore unmodifiable from JavaScript. This will prevent
malicious websites from convincing user agents to send forged metadata along with requests,
which should give sites a bit more confidence in their ability to respond reasonably to
the advertised information.

Directly User-Initiated Requests {#directly-user-initiated}
-----------------------------------------------------------

When <a abstract-op lt='set-site'>setting the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header</a>, user agents are asked to
distinguish between navigation requests that are "explicitly caused by a user's interaction". This
somewhat poorly defined phrase is pulled from HTML, which
[suggests that](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#navigating-across-documents)
"A user agent may provide various ways for the user to explicitly cause a browsing context to
navigate, in addition to those defined in this specification."

The goal is to distinguish between "webby" navigations that are controlled by a given (potentially
malicious!) website (e.g. links, the `window.location` setter, form submissions, etc.), and those
that are not (e.g. user interaction with a user agent's address bar, bookmarks, etc). The former
will be delivered with a `Sec-Fetch-Site` header whose value is `same-origin`, `same-site`, or
`cross-site`, as appropriate. The latter will be distinguished with a value of `none`, as no
specific site is actually responsible for the request, and it makes sense to allow servers to treat
them as trusted, as they somehow represent a user's direct intent.

Each user agent is likely to have a distinct set of interactions which might fall into one or the
other category, and it will be hard to share an automated test suite for these cases. Still, it
would be ideal to align on behavior for those which are likely to be common. Sme examples follow:

*   Navigation from the address bar: In the general case, this kind of navigation should be
    treated as directly user-initiated, and include `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`. It may be reasonable for
    user agents to include heuristics around pasting values into the address bar (especially if the
    "copy" action can be traced to a specific origin), and to treat such navigations distinctly from
    those which the user types themselves.

*   Navigation from user agent UI (bookmarks, new tab page, etc): A user's interaction with links in
    user agent UI should be treated similarly to their input in the user agent's address bar,
    including `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` to demarcate the navigation as user-initiated.

*   Navigation from a link's context menu (e.g. "Open in new window"): as the link's target is
    controlled by the page on which the link is present, user agents should treat the navigation as
    site-controlled, and set the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header appropriately for the relationship between
    the site which controls the link and the site which is being opened.

*   Ctrl-click on a link: the same arguments and conclusions apply here as apply to a link's context
    menu, discussed directly above.

*   Navigation through history (e.g. a user agent's "back" button): 

*   Drag-and-drop: It seems reasonable to distinguish behavior here based upon the source of the
    dragged content. If content is dragged from a tab, the user agent should be able to ascertain
    its origin, and set `Sec-Fetch-Site` accordingly. If content is dragged from elsewhere (the
    user agent's bookmark bar, another app entirely, etc), then `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` may be
    appropriate.



Deployment Considerations {#deployment-considerations}
======================================================

Vary {#vary}
------------

If a given endpoint's response depends upon the values the client delivers in a
[=Fetch metadata header=], developers should be careful to include an appropriate `Vary` header
[[RFC7231]], in order to ensure that caches handle the response appropriately. For example,
`Vary: Accept-Encoding, Sec-Fetch-Site`.

Header Bloat {#bloat}
---------------------

An earlier version of this document defined a single `Sec-Metadata` header, whose contents were
a dictionary. Subsequent discussion (as well as Mark Nottingham's excellent
[[mnot-designing-headers]]) shifted the design away from a single dictionary to a series of simple
headers, each of which contains only a single token. This design should perform significantly better
under HTTP's current HPACK compression algorithms.

Further discussion on the topic can be found on the review thread in
[w3ctag/design-reviews#280](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/280).
