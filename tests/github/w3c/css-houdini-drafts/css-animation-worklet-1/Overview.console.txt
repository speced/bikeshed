LINE 748: Saw an end tag </a>, but there's no open element corresponding to it.
LINE 901:1: Dfn autolinks can't contain more links in their linktext.
LINE 782: Multiple possible 'start time' dfn refs.
Arbitrarily chose https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-1/#transition-start-time
To auto-select one of the following refs, insert one of these lines into a <pre class=link-defaults> block:
spec:css-transitions-1; type:dfn; text:start time
spec:web-animations-1; type:dfn; text:start time
spec:fetch; type:dfn; text:start time
spec:service-workers; type:dfn; text:start time
spec:prefetch; type:dfn; text:start time
spec:prerendering-revamped; type:dfn; text:start time
[=start time=]
