# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

[[WEBDRIVER|WebDriver]] defines a protocol for introspection and
remote control of user agents. This specification extends WebDriver by
introducing bidirectional communication. In place of the strict
command/response format of WebDriver, this permits events to stream
from the user agent to the controlling software, better matching the
evented nature of the browser DOM.

# Infrastructure # {#infrastructure}

This specification depends on the Infra Standard. [[!INFRA]]

Network protocol messages are defined using CDDL. [[!RFC8610]]

# Protocol # {#protocol}

This section defines the basic concepts of the WebDriver BiDi
protocol. These terms are distinct from their representation at the
<a href=#transport>transport</a> layer.

The protocol is defined using a [[!RFC8610|CDDL]] definition. For the
convenience of implementors two seperate CDDL definitions are defined; the
<dfn>remote end definition</dfn> which defines the format of messages produced
on the [=local end=] and consumed on the [=remote end=], and the <dfn>local end
definition</dfn> which defines the format of messages produced on the [=remote
end=] and consumed on the [=local end=]

## Definition ## {#protocol-definition}

Issue: Should this be an appendix?

This section gives the initial contents of the [=remote end definition=] and
[=local end definition=]. These are augmented by the definition fragments defined in
the remainder of the specification.

[=Remote end definition=]

<pre class="cddl remote-cddl">
Command = {
  id: uint,
  CommandData,
  *text => any,
}

CommandData = (
  SessionCommand //
  BrowsingContextCommand
)

EmptyParams = { *text }
</pre>

[=Local end definition=]

<pre class="cddl local-cddl">
Message = (
  CommandResponse //
  ErrorResponse //
  Event
)

CommandResponse = {
  id: uint,
  result: ResultData,
  *text => any
}

ErrorResponse = {
  id: uint / null,
  error: "unknown error" / "unknown method" / "invalid argument",
  message: text,
  ?stacktrace: text,
  *text => any
}

ResultData = (
  EmptyResult //
  SessionResult //
  BrowsingContextResult //
  ScriptResult
)

EmptyResult = {}

Event = {
  EventData,
  *text => any
}

EventData = (
  BrowsingContextEvent //
  ScriptEvent
)
</pre>

## Session ## {#session}

WebDriver BiDi uses the same [=/session=] concept as WebDriver.

## Modules ## {#protocol-modules}

The WebDriver BiDi protocol is organized into modules.

Each <dfn export>module</dfn> represents a collection of related
[=commands=] and [=events=] pertaining to a certain aspect of the user
agent. For example, a module might contain functionality for inspecting and
manipulating the DOM, or for script execution.

Each module has a <dfn>module name</dfn> which is a string. The
[=command name=] and [=event name=] for commands and events defined in the
module start with the [=module name=] followed by a period "<code>.</code>".

Modules which contain [=commands=] define [=remote end definition=]
fragments. These provide choices in the <code>CommandData</code> group for the
module's [=commands=], and can also define additional definition properties. They
can also define [=local end definition=] fragments that provide additional choices
in the <code>ResultData</code> group for the results of commands in the module.

Modules which contain events define [=local end definition=] fragments that are
choices in the <code>Event</code> group for the module's [=events=].

An implementation may define <dfn>extension modules</dfn>. These must have a
[=module name=] that contains a single colon "<code>:</code>" character. The
part before the colon is the prefix; this is typically the same for all
extension modules specific to a given implementation and should be unique for a
given implementation. Such modules extend the [=local end definition=] and [=remote
end definition=] providing additional groups as choices for the defined
[=commands=] and [=events=].

## Commands ## {#commands}

A <dfn export>command</dfn> is an asynchronous operation, requested by
the [=local end=] and run on the [=remote end=], resulting in either a
result or an error being returned to the [=local end=]. Multiple
commands can run at the same time, and commands can potentially be
long-running. As a consequence, commands can finish out-of-order.

Each [=command=] is defined by:

- A <dfn export for=command>command type</dfn> which is defined by a [=remote
   end definition=] fragment containing a group. Each such group has two fields:
    - <code>method</code> which is a string literal of the form <code>[module
      name].[method name]</code>. This is the <dfn export for=command>command
      name</dfn>.
    - <code>params</code> which defines a mapping containing data that to be passed into
      the command. The populated value of this map is the
      <dfn export for=command>command parameters</dfn>.
- A <dfn export for=command>result type</dfn>, which is defined by a [=local
  end definition=] fragment.
- A set of [=remote end steps=] which define the actions to take for a command
  given [=command parameters=] and return an instance of the command [=return
  type=].

When commands are send from the [=local end=] they have a command id. This is an
identifier used by the [=local end=] to identify the response from a particular
command. From the point of view of the [=remote end=] this identifier is opaque
and cannot be used internally to identify the command.

Note: This is because the command id is entirely controlled by the [=local end=]
and isn't necessarily unique over the course of a session. For example a [=local
end=] which ignores all responses could use the same command id for each command.

The <dfn export for=command>set of all command names</dfn> is a set containing
all the defined [=command names=], including any belonging to [=extension
modules=].

## Events ## {#events}

An <dfn export>event</dfn> is a notification, sent by the [=remote
end=] to the [=local end=], signaling that something of interest has
occurred on the [=remote end=].

 - An <dfn export for=event>event type</dfn> is defined by a [=local
   end definition=] fragment containing a group. Each such group has two fields:
    - <code>method</code> which is a string literal of the form <code>[module
      name].[event name]</code>. This is the <dfn export for=event>event
      name</dfn>.

    - <code>params</code> which defines a mapping containing event data. The
      populated value of this map is the <dfn export for=command>event
      parameters</code>.
 - A <dfn export>remote end event trigger</dfn> which defines when the event is
   triggered and steps to construct the [=event type=] data.

A [=/session=] has a <dfn export for=event>global event set</dfn> which is a set
containing the event names for events that are enabled for all
browsing contexts. This initially contains the [=event name=] for events that
are <dfn export for=event>in the default event set</dfn>.

A [=/session=] has a <dfn export for=event>browsing context event map</dfn>,
which is a map with [=/browsing context=] keys and values that are maps from an
[=event name=] to a boolean indicating whether the specified event is enabled or
disabled for a given browsing context.

<div algorithm>

To determine if an <dfn export>event is enabled</dfn> given |session|,
|event name| and |browsing contexts|:

Note: |browsing contexts| is a set because a [=shared worker=] can be associated
      with multiple contexts.

  1. For each |browsing context| in |browsing contexts|:

    1. While |browsing context| is not null:

      1. Let |event map| be the [=browsing context event map=] for |session|.

      1. If |event map| [=contains=] |browsing context|, let |browsing context
         events| be |event map|[|browsing context|].  Otherwise let |browsing
         context events| be null.

      1. If |browsing context events| is not null, and |browsing context events|
         [=contains=] for |event name| return |browsing context
         events|[|event name|].

      1. Let |browsing context| be the [=parent browsing context=] of |browsing
         context|, if it has one, or null otherwise.

  1. If the [=global event set=] for |session| [=contains=] |event name| return
     true.

  1. Return false.

</div>

<div algorithm>

To <dfn>obtain a set of event names</dfn> given an |name|:

  1. Let |events| be an empty set.

  1. If |name| contains a U+002E (period):

    1. If |name| is the [=event name=] for an event, append |name| to |events|
       and return [=success=] with data |events|.

    1. Return an [=error=] with [=error code=] [=Invalid Argument=]

  1. Otherwise |name| is interpreted as representing all the events in a
     module. If |name| is not a [=module name=] return an [=error=] with
     [=error code=] [=Invalid Argument=].

  1. Append the [=event name=] for each [=event=] in the module with name |name| to
     |events|.

  1. Return [=success=] with data |events|.
</div>

# Transport # {#transport}

Message transport is provided using the WebSocket protocol.
[[!RFC6455]]

Note: In the terms of the WebSocket protocol, the [=local end=] is the
client and the [=remote end=] is the server / remote host.

Note: The encoding of [=commands=] and [=events=] as messages is
similar to JSON-RPC, but this specification does not normatively
reference it. [[JSON-RPC]] The normative requirements on [=remote
ends=] are instead given as a precise processing model, while no
normative requirements are given for [=local ends=].

A <dfn>WebSocket listener</dfn> is a network endpoint that is able
to accept incoming [[!RFC6455|WebSocket]] connections.

A [=WebSocket listener=] has a <dfn for=listener>host</dfn>, a <dfn
for=listener>port</dfn>, a <dfn for=listener>secure flag</dfn>, and a
<dfn>list of WebSocket resources</dfn>.

When a [=WebSocket listener=] |listener| is created, a [=remote end=]
must start to listen for WebSocket connections on the host and port
given by |listener|'s [=listener/host=] and [=listener/port=]. If
|listener|'s [=listener/secure flag=] is set, then connections
established from |listener| must be TLS encrypted.

A [=remote end=] has a [=set=] of [=WebSocket listeners=] <dfn>active
listeners</dfn>, which is initially empty.

A WebDriver [=/session=] has a <dfn>WebSocket connection</dfn> which is
a network connection that follows the requirements of the
[[!RFC6455|WebSocket protocol]]. This is initially null.

<div>

When a client [=establishes a WebSocket connection=] |connection| by
connecting to one of the set of [=active listeners=] |listener|, the
implementation must proceed according to the WebSocket [=server-side
requirements=], with the following steps run when deciding whether to
accept the incoming connection:

1. Let |resource name| be the resource name from [=reading the
   client's opening handshake=]. If |resource name| is not in
   |listener|'s [=list of WebSocket resources=], then stop
   running these steps and act as if the requested service is not
   available.

2. [=Get a session ID for a WebSocket resource=] with |resource name|
   and let |session id| be that value. If |session id| is null then
   stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not
   available.

3. If there is a [=/session=] in the list of [=active sessions=] with
   |session id| as its [=session ID=] then let |session| be that
   session. Otherwise stop running these steps and act as if the
   requested service is not available.

4. Run any other implementation-defined steps to decide if the
   connection should be accepted, and if it is not stop running these
   steps and act as if the requested service is not available.

5. Otherwise set |session|'s [=WebSocket connection=] to
   |connection|, and proceed with the WebSocket [=server-side
   requirements=] when a server chooses to accept an incoming connection.

Issue: Do we support > 1 connection for a single session?

</div>

When [=a WebSocket message has been received=] for a [=WebSocket
connection=] |connection| with type |type| and data |data|, a [=remote
end=] must [=handle an incoming message=] given |connection|, |type|
and |data|.

When [=the WebSocket closing handshake is started=] or when [=the
WebSocket connection is closed=] for a [=WebSocket connection=]
|connection|, a [=remote end=] must [=handle a connection closing=]
given |connection|.

Note: Both conditions are needed because it is possible for a
WebSocket connection to be closed without a closing handshake.

<div algorithm>

To <dfn lt="construct a WebSocket resource name|constructing a
WebSocket resource name">construct a WebSocket resource name</dfn>
given a [=/session=] |session|:

1. Return the result of concatenating the string "<code>/session/</code>"
   with |session|'s [=session ID=].

</div>

<div algorithm>

To <dfn lt="construct a WebSocket URL|constructing a WebSocket
URL">construct a WebSocket URL</dfn> given a [=WebSocket listener=]
|listener| and [=/session=] |session|:

1. Let |resource name| be the result of [=constructing a WebSocket
   resource name=] given |session|.

2. Return a [=WebSocket URI=] constructed with host set to
   |listener|'s [=listener/host=], port set to |listener|'s
   [=listener/port=], path set to |resource name|, following the wss-URI
   construct if |listener|'s [=listener/secure flag=] is set and the ws-URL
   construct otherwise.

</div>

<div algorithm>

To <dfn>get a session ID for a WebSocket resource</dfn>
given |resource name|:

1. If |resource name| doesn't begin with the byte string
   "<code>/session/</code>", return null.

2. Let |session id| be the bytes in |resource name| following the
   "<code>/session/</code>" prefix.

3. If |session id| is not the string representation of a
   [[!RFC4122|UUID]], return null.

4. Return |session id|.

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn>start listening for a WebSocket connection</dfn> given a
[=/session=] |session|:

 1. If there is an existing [=WebSocket listener=] in the set of
    [=active listeners=] which the [=remote end=] would like to reuse,
    let |listener| be that listener. Otherwise let |listener| be a new
    [=WebSocket listener=] with [=implementation-defined=]
    [=listener/host=], [=listener/port=], [=listener/secure flag=],
    and an empty [=list of WebSocket resources=].

 2. Let |resource name| be the result of [=constructing a WebSocket
    resource name=] given |session|.

 3. Append |resource name| to the [=list of WebSocket resources=] for
    |listener|.

 4. [=set/Append=] |listener| to the [=remote end=]'s [=active
     listeners=].

 5. Return |listener|.

</div>

Note: An [=intermediary node=] handling multiple sessions can use one
or many WebSocket listeners. [[!WEBDRIVER|WebDriver]] defines that
an [=endpoint node=] supports at most one session at a time, so it's
expected to only have a single listener.

Note: For an [=endpoint node=] the [=listener/host=] in the above steps will
typically be "<code>localhost</code>".

<div algorithm>
To <dfn>handle an incoming message</dfn> given a [=WebSocket connection=]
|connection|, type |type| and data |data|:

 1. If |type| is not [=%x1 denotes a text frame|text=], [=respond with an
    error=] given |connection|, null, and [=invalid argument=], and finally
    return.

 1. [=Assert=]: |data| is a [=scalar value string=], because the
     WebSocket [=handling errors in UTF-8-encoded data=] would already
     have [=fail the WebSocket connection|failed the WebSocket
     connection=] otherwise.

    Issue: Nothing seems to define what [=status codes|status code=]
    is used for UTF-8 errors.

1. Let |parsed| be the result of [=parse JSON into Infra values|parsing JSON
   into Infra values=] given |data|. If this throws an exception, then [=respond
   with an error=] given |connection|, null, and [=invalid argument=], and
   finally return.

 1. Match |parsed| against the [=remote end definition=]. If this results in a
    match:

    1. Let |matched| be the map representing the matched data.

    1. Assert: |matched| [=contains=] "<code>id</code>", "<code>method</code>", and
       "<code>params</code>".

    1. Let |command id| be |matched|["<code>id</code>"].

    1. Let |method| be |matched|["<code>method</code>"]

    1. Run the following steps in parallel:

      1. Let |result| be the result of running the [=remote end steps=] for the
         command with [=command name=] |method| given [=command parameters=]
         |matched|["<code>params</code>"]

      1. If |result| is an [=error=], then [=respond with an error=] given
         |connection|, |command id|, and |result|'s [=error code=], and finally
         return.

      1. Let |value| be |result|'s data.

      1. Assert: |value| matches the definition for the [=result type=]
         corresponding to the command with [=command name=] |method|.

      1. Let |response| be a new map matching the <code>CommandResponse</code>
         production in the [=local end definition=] with the <code>id</code>
         field set to |command id| and the <code>value</code> field set to
         |value|.

      1. Let |serialized| be the result of [=serialize an infra value to JSON
         bytes=] given |response|.

      1. [=Send a WebSocket message=] comprised of |serialized| over
         |connection| and return.

 1. Otherwise:

    1. Let |command id| be null.

    1. If |parsed| is a map and |parsed|["<code>id</code>"] exists and is an
       integer greater than or equal to zero, set |command id| to that integer.

    1. Let |error code| be [=invalid argument=].

    1. If |parsed| is a map and |parsed|["<code>method</code>"] exists and is a
       string, but |parsed|["<code>method</code>"] is not in the [=set of all
       command names=], set |error code| to [=unknown command=].

    1. [=Respond with an error=] given |connection|, |command id|, and
       |error code|.

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn export>emit an event</dfn> given |body| and |related contexts|:

 1. [=Assert=]: |body| has [=map/size=] 2 and [=contains=] "<code>method</code>"
    and "<code>params</code>".

 1. If the [=current session=] is null, or the [=current session=]'s [=WebSocket
    Connection=] is null then return.

 1. If [=event is enabled=] given [=current session=],
    |body|["<code>method</code>"] and |related contexts|:

   1. Let |connection| be the [=current session=]'s [=WebSocket connection=].

   1. Let |serialized| be the result of [=serialize an infra value to JSON

   1. [=Send a WebSocket message=] comprised of |serialized| over |connection|.

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn>respond with an error</dfn> given a [=WebSocket connection=]
|connection|, |command id|, and |error code|:

 1. Let |error data| be a new map matching the <code>ErrorResponse</code>
    production in the [=local end definition=], with the <code>id</code> field
    set to |command id|, the <code>error</code> field set to |error code|, the
    <code>message</code> field set to an implementation-defined string
    containing a human-readable definition of the error that occurred and the
    <code>stacktrace</code> field optionally set to an implementation-defined
    string containing a stack trace report of the active stack frames at the
    time when the error occurred.

 1. Let |response| be the result of [=serialize an infra value to JSON bytes=]
    given |error data|.

    Note: |command id| can be null, in which case the <code>id</code> field will
    also be set to null, not omitted from |response|.

 1. [=Send a WebSocket message=] comprised of |response| over |connection|.

</div>


<div algorithm>
To <dfn>handle a connection closing</dfn> given a
[=WebSocket connection=] |connection|:

 1. If there is a WebDriver [=/session=] with |connection| as its [=connection=],
    set the [=connection=] on that [=/session=] to null.

Issue: This should also reset any internal state

</div>

Note: This does not end any [=/session=].

Issue: Need to hook in to the session ending to allow the UA to close
the listener if it wants.

## Establishing a Connection ## {#establishing}

WebDriver clients opt in to a bidirectional connection by requesting a
capability with the name "<code>webSocketUrl</code>" and value
true.

This specification defines an
[=additional webdriver capability=] with the [=capability name=] "<code>webSocketUrl</code>".

<div algorithm="webSocketUrl capability deserialization algorithm">
The [=additional capability deserialization algorithm=] for the
"<code>webSocketUrl</code>" capability, with parameter |value| is:

 1. If |value| is not a boolean, return [=error=] with [=error code|code=]
    [=invalid argument=].

 2. Return [=success=] with data |value|.

</div>

<div algorithm="webSocketUrl capability serialization algorithm">
The [=matched capability serialization algorithm=] for the "<code>webSocketUrl</code>" capability,

# Common Data Types # {#data-types}

## Remote Value ## {#type-common-RemoteValue}

Values accessible from the ECMAScript runtime are represented by a mirror
object, specified as <code>RemoteValue</code>. The value's type is specified in
the <code>type</code> property. In the case of JSON-representable primitive
values, this contains the value in the <code>value</code> property; in the case
of non-JSON-representable primitives, the <code>value</code> property contains a
string representation of the value. For non-primitive objects, the
<code>objectId</code> property contains a string id that provides a unique
handle to the object, valid for its lifetime inside the engine. For some
non-primitive types, the <code>value</code> property contains a representation
of the data in the ECMAScript object; for container types this can contain
further <code>RemoteValue</code> instances. The <code>value</code> property can
be null if there is a duplicate object i.e. the object has already been
serialized in the current <code>RemoteValue</code>, perhaps as part of a
cycle, or otherwise when the maximum serialization depth is reached.

[=Nodes=] are also represented by <code>RemoteValue</code> instances. These have
a partial serialization of the node in the value property.

Note: mirror objects do not keep the original object alive in the runtime. If an
object is discarded in the runtime subsequent attempts to access it via the
protocol will result in an error.

A [=/session=] has an <dfn>object id map</dfn>. This is a weak map from objects to
their corresponding id.

Issue: Should this be explicitly per realm?

<div algorithm>
To get the <dfn>object id for an object</dfn> given an |object|:

  1. If the [=object id map=] for the [=current session=] does not contain |object|
     run the following steps:

     1. Let |object id| be a new, unique, string identifier for |object|. If
        |object| is an [=/element=] this must be the [=web element reference=]
        for |object|; if it's a {{WindowProxy}} object, this must be the
        [=window handle=] for |object|.

    1. Set the value of |object| in the [=object id map=] to |object id|.

  1. Return the result of getting the value for |object| in [=object id map=].

Issue: the way this hooks into HTML feels very fragile. See https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6194

Issue: It's unclear if we ought to only fire this event for browsing
contexts that have active documents; navigation can also cause contexts to
become inaccessible but not yet get discarded because bfcache.

Issue: We currently don't provide information about realms of unknown

Note: Future variations of this specification will retain the invariant that
         the last component of the type name after splitting on "<code>-</code>"
         will always be "<code>worker</code>" for globals implementing
         {{WorkerGlobalScope}}, and "<code>worklet</code>" for globals

Issue: Extend this to also allow realm parents e.g. for nested workers? Or get all ancestor workers.

Issue: We might want to have a more sophisticated filter system than just a

# Patches to Other Specifications # {#patches}

This specification requires some changes to external specifications to provide the necessary
integration points. It is assumed that these patches will be committed to the other specifications
as part of the standards process.

## HTML ##  {#patches-html}

The [=a browsing context is discarded=] algorithm is modified to read as follows:

<div algorithm>
To discard a browsing context |browsingContext|, run these steps:

 1. If this is not a recursive invocation of this algorithm, call any <dfn export>browsing context
    tree discarded</dfn> steps defined in external specifications with |browsingContext|.

 1. Discard all {{Document}} objects for all the entries in |browsingContext|'s [=session
    history=].

 1. If |browsingContext| is a [=top-level browsing context=], then [=remove a browsing context=]
    |browsingContext|.

</div>

Issue: The actual patch might be better to split the algorithm into an outer algorithm that is
called by external callers and an inner algorithm that's used for recursive calls. That's quite hard
to express as a patch to the specification since it requires changing multiple parts.
