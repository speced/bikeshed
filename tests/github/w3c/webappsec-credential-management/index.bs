  # Introduction # {#introduction}

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Signing into websites is more difficult than it should be. The user agent is in a unique position
  to improve the experience in a number of ways, and most modern user agents have recognized this by
  providing some measure of <i>credential management</i> natively in the browser. For example, users can save usernames
  and passwords for websites; those [=credentials=] are later autofilled into sign-in forms, albeit with
  varying degrees of success.

  The <{input/autocomplete}> attribute offers a declarative mechanism by which websites can work
  with user agents to improve the latter's ability to detect and fill sign-in forms by marking
  specific fields as "username" or "password", and user agents implement a wide variety of detection
  heuristics to work with websites which haven't taken the time to provide this detail in markup.

  While this combination of heuristic and declarative detection works relatively well, the status
  quo leaves some large gaps where detection is problematic. Sites with uncommon sign-in
  mechanisms (submitting credentials via {{XMLHttpRequest}} [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]], for instance) are
  difficult to reliably detect, as is the increasingly common case in which users wish to
  authenticate themselves using a federated identity provider. Allowing websites to more directly
  interact with the user agent's credential manager would allow the credential manager to be more
  accurate on the one hand, and to assist users with federated sign-in on the other.

  These use cases are explored in more detail in [[#use-cases]] and in
  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/usecases/credentialmanagement/">Credential Management:
  Use Cases and Requirements</a>; this specification attempts to address many of the requirements
  that document outlines by defining a Credential Manager API which a website can use to request
  [=credentials=] for a user, and to ask the user agent to persist credentials when a user signs in
  successfully.

  Note: The API defined here is intentionally small and simple: it does not intend to provide
  authentication in and of itself, but is limited to providing an interface to the existing
  credential managers implemented by existing user agents. That functionality is valuable
  <em>right now</em>, without significant effort on the part of either vendors or authors. There's
  certainly quite a bit more which could be done, of course. See [[#teh-futur]] for some thoughts
  we've punted for now, but which could be explored in future iterations of this API.

  ## Use Cases ## {#use-cases}

  Modern user agents generally offer users the capability to save passwords when signing into a
  website, and likewise offer the capability to fill those passwords into sign-in forms fully- or
  semi-automatically when users return to a website. From the perspective of a website, this
  behavior is completely invisible: the website doesn't know that passwords have been stored, and
  it isn't notified that passwords have been filled. This is both good and bad. On the one hand, a
  user agent's password manager works regardless of whether or not a site cooperates, which is
  excellent for users. On the other, the password managers' behaviors are a fragile and proprietary
  hodgepodge of heuristics meant to detect and fill sign-in forms, password change forms, etc.

  A few problems with the status quo stand out as being particularly noteworthy:

  *   User agents have an incredibly difficult time helping users with
      federated identity providers. While detecting a username/password
      form submission is fairly straightforward, detecting sign-in via a
      third-party is quite difficult to reliably do well. It would be nice
      if a website could help the user agent understand the intent behind the
      redirects associated with a typical federated sign-in action.

  *   Likewise, user agents struggle to detect more esoteric sign-in
      mechanisms than simple username/password forms. Authors increasingly
      asynchronously sign users in via {{XMLHttpRequest}} or similar
      mechanisms in order to improve the experience and take more control over
      the presentation. This is good for users, but tough for user agents to
      integrate into their password managers. It would be nice if a website
      could help the user agent make sense of the sign-in mechanism they
      choose to use.

  *   Finally, changing passwords is less well-supported than it could be if
      the website explicitly informed the user agent that credentials had
      changed.

  # Core API # {#core}

  From a developer's perspective, a <dfn export id="concept-credential">credential</dfn> is an
  object which allows a developer to make an authentication decision for a particular action. This
  section defines a generic and extensible {{Credential}} interface which serves as a base class
  for [=credentials=] defined in this and other documents, along with a set of APIs
  hanging off of {{CredentialsContainer|navigator.credentials.*}} which enable developers to
  obtain them.

  Various [=credential type registry/credential types=] are each represented to JavaScript as an interface which
  [=interface/inherits=], either directly or indirectly, from the {{Credential}} interface. This
  document defines two such interfaces, {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}}. Other
  specifications, for example [[WEBAUTHN]], define other credential types.

  A [=credential=] is <dfn export for="credential">effective</dfn> for a particular [=origin=] if it
  is accepted as authentication on that origin. Even if a credential is effective at a particular
  point in time, the UA can't assume that the same credential will be effective at any future time,
  for a couple reasons:

  1. A password credential may stop being effective if the account holder changes their password.
  2. A credential made from a token received over SMS is likely to only be effective for a single
     use.

  Single-use [=credentials=] are generated by a <dfn export>credential source</dfn>, which could be
  a private key, access to a federated account, the ability to receive SMS messages at a particular
  phone number, or something else. Credential sources are not exposed to Javascript or explicitly
  represented in this specification. To unify the model, we consider a password to be a credential
  source on its own, which is simply copied to create password credentials.

  Even though the UA can't assume that an effective credential will still be effective if used a
  second time, or that a credential source that has generated an effective credential will be able
  to generate a second effective credential in the future, the second is more likely than the first.
  By recording (with {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}) which credentials have been effective in the
  past, the UA has a better chance of [offering](#user-mediated-selection) effective credential
  sources to the user in the future.

  ## Infrastructure ## {#core-infrastructure}

  User agents MUST internally provide a <dfn export id="concept-credential-store">credential
  store</dfn>, which is a vendor-specific, opaque storage mechanism to record which [=credentials=]
  have been [=effective=]. It offers the following capabilities for [=credential=] access and
  persistence:

  1.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Store a credential</dfn> for later retrieval.
      This accepts a [=credential=], and inserts it into the [=credential store=].

  2.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Retrieve a list of credentials</dfn>. This
      accepts an arbitrary filter, and returns a set of [=credentials=] that match the filter.

  3.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Modify a credential</dfn>. This accepts a
      [=credential=], and overwrites the state of an existing [=credential=] in the
      [=credential store=].

  Additionally, the [=credential store=] should maintain a <dfn for="origin">`prevent silent
  access` flag</dfn> for [=origins=] (which is set to `true` unless otherwise specified).
  An origin <dfn for="origin">requires user mediation</dfn> if its flag is set to `true`.

  Note: The importance of user mediation is discussed in more detail in [[#user-mediation]].

  Note: The [=credential store=] is an internal implementation detail of a user agent's
  implementation of the API specified in this document, and is not exposed to the web directly.
  More capabilities may be specified by other documents in support of specific [=credential=]
  types.

  This document depends on the Infra Standard for a number of foundational concepts used in its
  algorithms and prose [[!INFRA]].

  Each [=/environment settings object=] has an associated <dfn noexport>active credential
  types</dfn>, a [=set=] which is initially empty.


  ### Infrastructure Algorithms ### {#sctn-infra-algorithms}

  <!-- NOTE: '<h4>' maps to the same heading level as three hashs '###', thus using '<h5>' for the next section -->
  <h5 id="algorithm-same-origin-with-ancestors" algorithm>Same-Origin with its Ancestors</h5>

  An [=environment settings object=] (|settings|) is <dfn noexport>same-origin with its
  ancestors</dfn> if the following algorithm returns `true`:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  If |settings|'s [=relevant global object=] has no [=associated Document=],
        return `false`.

    2.  Let |document| be |settings|' [=relevant global object=]'s [=associated Document=].

    3.  If |document| has no [=document/browsing context=], return `false`.

    4.  Let |origin| be |settings|' [=environment settings object/origin=].

    5.  Let |current| be |document|'s [=document/browsing context=].

    6.  While |current| has a [=parent browsing context=]:

        1.  Set |current| to |current|'s [=parent browsing context=].

        2.  If |current|'s [=active document=]'s [=origin=] is not [=same origin=] with |origin|,
            return `false`.

    7.  Return `true`.
  </ol>

  ### Credential Type Registry ### {#sctn-cred-type-registry}

  This registry maps [=credential type registry/credential types=] (i.e., {{Credential/[[type]]}} values) to various values associated with a given credential type. For example: the [=credential type registry/Options Member Identifier=]
  (formally, a [=dictionary member=] [=identifier=]) used in
  {{CredentialCreationOptions}} and {{CredentialRequestOptions}} (i.e., "options dictionaries")
  by their specifications.

  Note: This registry is used by the [=relevant credential interface objects=] algorithm.

  <!-- NOTE: The below Registration Entry Requirements and Update Process is based on
  https://www.w3.org/TR/timing-entrytypes-registry/, and is similar to other W3C
  "registry" specs. I.e., this Requirements and Update Process is typical for
  W3C registries. -->

  #### Registration Entry Requirements and Update Process #### {#sctn-registry-requirements}

  * Each [=credential type registry/credential type=] must be unique amongst the set of [=credential type registry/credential types=].

  * Each registry entry must state the [=dictionary member=] [=identifier=] (known as the [=credential type registry/Options Member Identifier=] in the registry) used in the
    credential specification's extentions of {{CredentialCreationOptions}} and
    {{CredentialRequestOptions}}.

  * Each registry entry must state the [=credential type registry/Appropriate Interface Object=] [=identifier=] for the
    [=credential type registry/credential type=].

  * Each registry entry must include a link that references a publicly available specification
    defining the [=credential type registry/credential type=] and the [=dictionary member=] [=identifier=].

  * Each registry entry's specification must include the requestor's contact information.

  An update to this registry is an addition, change or deletion of a [=credential type registry/credential type=]'s registry entry.
  Any person can request an update to this registry by pull requests to the
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-credential-management">webappsec-credential-management</a>
  repository.
  The Web Applications Security Working Group will place it on an upcoming meeting agenda
  and notify the requestor.
  Consideration and disposition of the request is by consensus of the W3C Web Applications
  Security Working Group.
  The Chair will then notify the requestor of the outcome and update the registry accordingly.


  ## The `Credential` Interface ## {#the-credential-interface}

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    interface Credential {
      readonly attribute USVString id;
      readonly attribute DOMString type;
      static Promise&lt;boolean&gt; isConditionalMediationAvailable();
    };
  </pre>
  <div dfn-for="Credential">
    :   <dfn attribute>id</dfn>
    ::  The credential's identifier. The requirements for the identifier are distinct for each type
        of [=credential=]. It might represent a username for username/password tuples, for example.

    :   <dfn attribute>type</dfn>
    ::  This attribute's getter returns the value of the object's [=interface object=]'s
        {{[[type]]}} slot, which specifies the [=credential/credential type=] represented by this object.

    :   <dfn method>isConditionalMediationAvailable()</dfn>
    ::  Returns a new {{Promise}} that [=resolves=] with `true` if and only if the user agent supports the
        {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}} approach to
        [[#mediation-requirements|mediation of credential requests]] for the [=credential/credential type=],
        `false` otherwise.

        {{Credential}}'s default implementation of {{Credential/isConditionalMediationAvailable()}}:

        <ol class="algorithm">
            1.  Return a new {{Promise}} that immediately [=resolves=] with `false`.
        </ol>

        The specification for any [=credential/credential type=] supporting
        {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}} mediation must explicitly override this
        function to [=resolve=] to `true`.

        Note: If this function is not present, {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}}
        mediation is not supported for the [=credential/credential type=].

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[type]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{Credential}} [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]`, which
        unsurprisingly contains a <dfn for="credential" lt="credential type">string representing the credential type</dfn>. The slot's value
        is the empty string unless otherwise specified. See [[#sctn-cred-type-registry]] for a list of [=credential type registry/credential types=].

        Note: The {{[[type]]}} slot's value will be the same for all credentials implementing a
        particular interface, which means that developers can rely on `obj.type` returning a string
        that unambiguously represents the specific kind of {{Credential}} they're dealing with.

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[discovery]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{Credential}} [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[discovery]]`,
        representing the mechanism by which the user agent can collect credentials of
        a given type. Its value is either
        "<dfn enum-value for="Credential/[[discovery]]">`credential store`</dfn>" or
        "<dfn enum-value for="Credential/[[discovery]]">`remote`</dfn>". The former value means that
        all available credential information is stored in the user agent's [=credential store=],
        while the latter means that the user agent can discover credentials outside of those
        explicitly represented in the [=credential store=] via interaction with some external device
        or service.
  </div>

  ISSUE: Talk to Tobie/Dominic about the [=interface object=] bits, here and in
  [[#algorithm-request]], etc. I'm not sure I've gotten the terminology right. [=interface prototype
  object=], maybe?

  Some {{Credential}} objects are <dfn for="Credential">origin bound</dfn>: these contain an
  internal slot named <dfn for="Credential" attribute>\[[origin]]</dfn>, which stores the [=origin=]
  for which the {{Credential}} may be [=effective=].

  ### `Credential` Internal Methods ### {#credential-internal-methods}
  
  The {{Credential}} [=interface object=] features several [=internal methods=] facilitating 
  retrieval and storage of {{Credential}} objects, with default "no-op" implementations
  as specified in this section, below.

  Unless otherwise specified, each [=interface object=] created for interfaces which [=interface/inherit=] 
  from {{Credential}} MUST provide implementations for at least one of these internal methods, overriding
  {{Credential}}'s default implementations, as appropriate for the [=credential=] type. E.g.,
  [[#passwordcredential-interface]], [[#federatedcredential-interface]], and [[WEBAUTHN]].

  <h5 id="algorithm-collect-creds" algorithm>`[[CollectFromCredentialStore]]` internal method</h5>
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)</dfn>
    is called with an [=environment settings object/origin=], a {{CredentialRequestOptions}}, and a boolean which
    is true iff the caller's [=environment settings object=] is [=same-origin with its ancestors=].
    The algorithm returns a set of {{Credential}} objects from the user agent's [=credential store=] that
    match the options provided. If no matching {{Credential}} objects are available, the
    returned set will be empty.

    {{Credential}}'s default implementation of
    {{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}:

    <ol class="algorithm">
      1.  Return an empty set.
    </ol>


  <h5 id="algorithm-discover-creds" algorithm>`[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]]` internal method</h5>
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)</dfn>
    is called [=in parallel=] with an [=environment settings object/origin=], a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object,
    and a boolean which is true iff the caller's [=environment settings object=] is
    [=same-origin with its ancestors=].
    It returns a {{Credential}} if one can be
    returned given the options provided, `null` if no credential is available, or throws an
    error if discovery fails (for example, incorrect options could produce a {{TypeError}}).
    If this kind of {{Credential}} is only [=effective=] for a single use or a limited time,
    this method is responsible for generating new [=credentials=] using a [=credential source=].

    {{Credential}}'s default implementation of
    {{Credential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}:

    <ol class="algorithm">
      1.  Return `null`.
    </ol>

  <h5 id="algorithm-store-cred" algorithm>`[[Store]]` internal method</h5>
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[Store]](credential, sameOriginWithAncestors)</dfn>
    is called [=in parallel=] with a {{Credential}}, and a boolean which is true iff the caller's
    [=environment settings object=] is [=same-origin with its ancestors=].
    The algorithm returns once {{Credential}} is persisted to the [=credential store=].

    {{Credential}}'s default implementation of {{Credential/[[Store]](credential, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}:

    <ol class="algorithm">
      1.  Return `undefined`.
    </ol>

  <h5 id="algorithm-create-cred" algorithm>`[[Create]]` internal method</h5>
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)</dfn>
    is called [=in parallel=] with an [=environment settings object/origin=], a {{CredentialCreationOptions}},
    and a boolean which is true iff the caller's
    [=environment settings object=] is [=same-origin with its ancestors=].
    The algorithm either:

    * creates a {{Credential}}, or
    * does not create a credential and returns `null`, or
    * throws an error if creation fails due to exceptional situations
        (for example, incorrect options could produce a {{TypeError}}).

    When creating a {{Credential}}, it will return an algorithm that takes a [=global object=]
        and returns an [=interface object=]
        inheriting from {{Credential}}. This algorithm MUST be invoked from a [=task=].

    Note: This algorithm's steps are defined on a per-[=credential/credential type=] basis.

  ### `CredentialUserData` Mixin ### {#credentialuserdata-mixin}

  Some {{Credential}} objects contain data which aims to give users a human-readable disambiguation
  mechanism in the [=credential chooser=] by providing a friendly name and icon:

  <pre class="idl">
    [SecureContext]
    interface mixin CredentialUserData {
      readonly attribute USVString name;
      readonly attribute USVString iconURL;
    };
  </pre>
  <div dfn-for="CredentialUserData">
    :   <dfn attribute>name</dfn>
    ::  A name associated with the credential, intended as a human-understandable public name for
        display in a [=credential chooser=].
    :   <dfn attribute>iconURL</dfn>
    ::  A URL pointing to an image for the credential, intended for display in a
        [=credential chooser=]. This URL MUST be an <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated
        URL</a>.
  </div>

  ## `navigator.credentials` ## {#framework-credential-management}

  Developers retrieve {{Credential}}s and interact with the user agent's [=credential store=] via
  methods exposed on the
  {{CredentialsContainer}} interface, which hangs off the {{Navigator}} object as
  <a attribute for="Navigator" lt="credentials">`navigator.credentials`</a>.

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface Navigator {
      [SecureContext, SameObject] readonly attribute CredentialsContainer credentials;
    };
  </pre>

  The <dfn for="Navigator" attribute>`credentials`</dfn> attribute MUST return the
  {{CredentialsContainer}} associated with the [=active document=]'s [=document/browsing context=].

  Note: As discussed in [[#insecure-sites]], the credential management API is exposed only in
  [=Secure Contexts=].

  <pre class="idl">

        Note: The intent here is a signal from the origin that the user has signed out. That
        is, after a click on a "Sign out" button, the site updates the user's session info, and
        calls `navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess()`. This sets the <a>`prevent silent
        access` flag</a>, meaning that credentials will not be automagically handed back to the
        page next time the user visits.

        Note: This function was previously called `requireUserMediation()` which should be considered
        deprecated.

  ### The `CredentialRequestOptions` Dictionary ### {#credentialrequestoptions-dictionary}

  In order to retrieve a {{Credential}} via {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}, the caller specifies a
  few parameters in a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object.

  Note: The {{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary is an extension point. If and when new types of
  credentials are introduced that require options, their dictionary types will be added to the
  dictionary so they can be passed into the request. See [[#implementation-extension]].

  <pre class="idl">
    dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
      CredentialMediationRequirement mediation = "optional";
      AbortSignal signal;
    };
  </pre>
  <div dfn-for="CredentialRequestOptions" dfn-type="dict-member">
    :   <dfn>mediation</dfn>
    ::  This property specifies the mediation requirements for a given credential request. The
        meaning of each enum value is described below in {{CredentialMediationRequirement}}.

    :   <dfn>signal</dfn>
    ::  This property lets the developer abort an ongoing {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} operation.
        An aborted operation may complete normally (generally if the abort was received after the
        operation finished) or reject with an [=AbortSignal/abort reason=].
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    Earlier versions of this specification defined a boolean `unmediated` member. Setting that
    to `true` had the effect of setting {{CredentialRequestOptions/mediation}} to
    "{{CredentialMediationRequirement/silent}}", and setting it to `false` had the effect of
    setting {{CredentialRequestOptions/mediation}} to "{{CredentialMediationRequirement/optional}}".

    `unmediated` should be considered deprecated; new code should instead rely on
    {{CredentialRequestOptions/mediation}}.
  </div>

  <div algorithm="relevant credential interfaces">
    The <dfn for="CredentialRequestOptions,CredentialCreationOptions">relevant credential interface objects</dfn> for a given

    Note: This algorithm uses the [[#sctn-cred-type-registry|Credential Type Registry]].

    <ol class="algorithm">

                Identifier=] is |optionKey|.

            1.  Append |credentialInterfaceObject| to |relevant interface objects|.

        1.  Return |relevant interface objects|.
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div algorithm="can collect locally">
    A given {{CredentialRequestOptions}} (|options|) is
    <dfn for="CredentialRequestOptions">matchable <i lang="la">a priori</i></dfn> if the following
    steps return `true`:

    <ol class="algorithm">

          1.  If |interface|'s {{Credential/[[discovery]]}} slot's value is not
              "{{Credential/[[discovery]]/credential store}}", return `false`.

      1.  Return `true`.
    </ol>

    Note: When executing {{get(options)}}, we only return credentials without [=user mediation=] if
    the provided {{CredentialRequestOptions}} is <a>matchable <i lang="la">a priori</i></a>. If any
    credential types are requested that could require discovery from some external service (OAuth
    tokens, security key authenticators, etc.), then [=user mediation=] will be required in order
    to guide the discovery process (by choosing a federated identity provider, BTLE device, etc).
  </div>

  ### Mediation Requirements ### {#mediation-requirements}

  When making a request via {{get(options)}}, developers can set a case-by-case requirement for
  [=user mediation=] by choosing the appropriate {{CredentialMediationRequirement}} enum value.

  Note: The [[#user-mediation]] section gives more detail on the concept in general, and its
  implications on how the user agent deals with individual requests for a given origin).

  <pre class="idl">
    enum CredentialMediationRequirement {
      "silent",
      "optional",
      "conditional",
      "required"
    };
  </pre>
  <div dfn-for="CredentialMediationRequirement" dfn-type="enum-value">
    :   <dfn>silent</dfn>
    ::  User mediation is suppressed for the given operation. If the operation can be performed
        without user involvement, wonderful. If user involvement is necessary, then the operation
        will return `null` rather than involving the user.

        Note: The intended usage is to support ["Keep me signed-into this site"
        scenarios](#example-mediation-silent), where a developer may wish to silently obtain
        credentials if a user should be automatically signed in, but to delay bothering the user
        with a sign-in prompt until they actively choose to sign-in.

    :   <dfn>optional</dfn>
    ::  If credentials can be handed over for a given operation without user mediation, they will
        be. If [=requires user mediation|user mediation is required=], then the user agent will
        involve the user in the decision.

        Note: This is the default behavior for {{get()}}, and is intended to serve a case where a
        developer has reasonable confidence that a user expects to start a sign-in operation. If
        a user has just clicked "sign-in" for example, then they won't be surprised or confused to
        see a [=credential chooser=] if necessary.

    :   <dfn>conditional</dfn>
    ::  Discovered credentials are presented to the user in a non-modal dialog along with an
        indication of the [=origin=] which is requesting credentials. If the user makes a gesture
        outside of the dialog, the dialog closes without resolving or rejecting the {{Promise}}
        returned by the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} method and without causing a user-visible
        error condition. If the user makes a gesture that selects a credential, that credential is
        returned to the caller. The [=prevent silent access flag=] is treated as being `true`
        regardless of its actual value: the {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}} behavior
        always involves [=user mediation=] of some sort if applicable credentials are discovered.

        If no credentials are discovered, the user agent MAY prompt the user to take action in a way
        that depends on the type of credential (e.g. to insert a device containing credentials).
        Either way, the `get()` method MUST NOT resolve immediately with `null` to avoid revealing
        the lack of applicable credentials to the website.

        Websites can only pass {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}} into the
        {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} method if all of the [=relevant credential interface objects|credential
        interfaces it refers to=] have overridden {{Credential/isConditionalMediationAvailable()}} to return
        a new {{Promise}} that [=resolves=] with `true`.

    :   <dfn>required</dfn>
    ::  The user agent will not hand over credentials without [=user mediation=], even if the
        [=prevent silent access flag=] is unset for an origin.

        Note: This requirement is intended to support [reauthentication](#example-mediation-require)
        or [user-switching](#example-mediation-switch) scenarios. Further, the requirement is tied
        to a specific operation, and does not affect the [=prevent silent access flag=] for the
        origin. To set that flag, developers should call {{preventSilentAccess()}}.

  #### Examples #### {#mediation-examples}

  <div class="example" id="example-mediation-silent">
    MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to seamlessly sign in users when possible. They can do so by calling
    {{get()}} for all non-signed in users at some convinient point while a landing page is loading,
    passing in a {{CredentialRequestOptions/mediation}} member set to
    "{{CredentialMediationRequirement/silent}}". This ensures that users who have opted-into
    dropping the requirements for user mediation (as described in [[#user-mediation-requirement]])
    are signed in, and users who haven't opted-into such behavior won't be bothered with a confusing
    [=credential chooser=] popping up without context:

  # Password Credentials # {#passwords}

  For good or for ill, many websites rely on username/password pairs as an authentication mechanism.
  The {{PasswordCredential}} interface is a [=credential=] meant to enable this use case, storing
  both a username and password, as well as metadata that can help a user choose the right account
  from within a [=credential chooser=].

  ## Examples ##  {#password-examples}

  ### Password-based Sign-in ### {#examples-password-signin}
  
  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp, Inc. supports passwords, and can use {{get()|navigator.credentials.get()}} to obtain
    username/password pairs from a user's [=credential store=]:

    <pre>
      navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>
        .<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({ '<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>': true })
        .then(credential =&gt; {
          if (!credential) {
            // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
            // refused to share them. Insert some code here to fall back to
            // a basic login form.
            return;
          }
          if (credential.<a attribute for="Credential">type</a> == '<a const>password</a>') {
            var form = new FormData();
            form.append('username_field', credential.id);
            form.append('password_field', credential.password);
            var opt = {
              method: 'POST',
              body: form,
              credentials: 'include'  // Send cookies.
            };
            fetch('https://example.com/loginEndpoint', opt)
              .then(function (response) {
                if (/* |response| indicates a successful login */) {
                  // Record that the credential was effective. See note below.
                  navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()" for="CredentialsContainer">store</a>(credential);
                  // Notify the user that sign-in succeeded! Do amazing, signed-in things!
                  // Maybe navigate to a landing page via location.href =
                  // '/signed-in-experience'?
                } else {
                  // Insert some code here to fall back to a basic login form.
                }
              });
          }
        });
    </pre>

    Alternatively, the website could just copy the credential data into a <{form}> and call
    {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}} on the form:

    <pre>
      navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>
        .<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({ '<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>': true })
        .then(credential =&gt; {
          if (!credential) {
            return; // as above...
          }
          if (credential.<a attribute for="Credential">type</a> === '<a const href="#password-literal">password</a>') {
            document.querySelector('input[name=username_field]').value =
              credential.id;
            document.querySelector('input[name=password_field]').value =
              credential.password;
            document.getElementById('myform').submit();
          }
        });
    </pre>

    Note that the former method is much preferred, as it contains an explicit call
    to {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} and saves the credentials. The <{form}> based mechanism
    relies on form submission, which navigates the browsing context, making it difficult to
    ensure that {{store()}} is called after successful sign-in.
  </div>

  Note: The [=credential chooser=] presented by the user agent could allow the user to choose
  credentials that aren't actually stored for the current origin. For instance, it might offer up
  credentials from `https://m.example.com` when signing into `https://www.example.com` (as
  described in [[#security-credential-access]]), or it might allow a user to create a new
  credential on the fly. Developers can deal gracefully with this uncertainty by calling
  {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} every time credentials are successfully used, even right after
  credentials have been retrieved from {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}: if the credentials aren't
  yet stored for the origin, the user will be given the opportunity to do so. If they are stored,
  the user won't be prompted.

  ### Post-sign-in Confirmation ### {#examples-post-signin}

  To ensure that users are offered to store new credentials after a successful sign-in, they can
  to be passed to {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}.

  <div class="example">
    If a user is signed in by submitting the credentials to a sign-in endpoint via {{fetch()}},
    we can check the response to determine whether the user
    was signed in successfully, and notify the user agent accordingly. Given a sign-in form like the
    following:

    <pre>
      &lt;form action="https://example.com/login" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
        &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>"&gt;
        &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>current-password</a>"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    Then the developer can handle the form submission with something like the following handler:

    <pre>
      document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener('submit', e =&gt; {
          if (<a interface lt="PasswordCredential">window.PasswordCredential</a>) {
            e.preventDefault();

            // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
            // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
            // labeled with "username" and "current-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
            // attributes:
            var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

            // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in
            // as a FormData object. If the response indicates success, tell the user agent
            // so it can ask the user to store the password for future use:
            var opt = {
              method: 'POST',
              body: new FormData(e.target),
              credentials: 'include'  // Send cookies.
            };
            fetch(e.target.action, opt).then(r =&gt; {
              if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
                <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
            });
          }
      });
    </pre>
  </div>

  ### Change Password ### {#examples-change-password}

  This same storage mechanism can be reused for "password change" with no modifications: if the
  user changes their credentials, the website can notify the user agent that they've successfully
  signed in with new credentials. The user agent can then update the credentials it stores:

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. allows users to change their passwords by POSTing data to
    a backend server asynchronously. After doing so successfully, they can
    update the user's credentials by calling {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}
    with the new information.

    Given a password change form like the following:

    <pre>
      &lt;form action="https://example.com/changePassword" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>" value="user"&gt;
        &lt;label for="password"&gt;New Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>new-password</a>"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    The developer can handle the form submission with something like the following:

    <pre>
      document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener('submit', e =&gt; {
        if (<a interface lt="PasswordCredential">window.PasswordCredential</a>) {
          e.preventDefault();

          // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
          // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
          // labeled with "username" and "new-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
          // attributes:
          var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

          // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in
          // as a FormData object. If the response indicates success, tell the user agent
          // so it can ask the user to store the password for future use:
          var opt = {
            method: 'POST',
            body: new FormData(e.target),
            credentials: 'include'  // Send cookies.
          };
          fetch(e.target.action, opt).then(r =&gt; {
            if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
              <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
          });
        }
      });
    </pre>
  </div>

  {{PasswordCredential}} objects can be created via

  {{FederatedCredential}} objects can be created by passing a {{FederatedCredentialInit}} dictionary
  into {{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}}.

  <pre class="idl">
    dictionary FederatedCredentialInit : CredentialData {
      USVString name;

    };

    partial dictionary CredentialCreationOptions {
      FederatedCredentialInit federated;
    };
  </pre>

  {{FederatedCredential}} objects are [=Credential/origin bound=].

  {{FederatedCredential}}'s [=interface object=] inherits {{Credential}}'s implementation of
  {{Credential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
  and defines its own implementation of
  {{FederatedCredential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
  {{FederatedCredential/[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}, and
  {{FederatedCredential/[[Store]](credential, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}.

  Note: If, in the future, we teach the user agent to obtain authentication tokens on a user's
  behalf, we could do so by building an implementation of
  `[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)`.

  ### Identifying Providers ### {#provider-identification}

  Every site should use the same identifier when referring to a specific federated identity
  provider. For example,
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.0">Facebook Login</a>
  shouldn't be referred to as "Facebook" and "Facebook Login" and "FB" and "FBL" and "Facebook.com"
  and so on. It should have a canonical identifier which everyone can make use of, as consistent
  identification makes it possible for user agents to be helpful.

  For consistency, federations passed into the APIs defined in this document (e.g.
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions}}'s {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array, or
  {{FederatedCredential}}'s {{FederatedCredential/provider}} property) MUST be identified by the
  <a lt="ASCII serialization of an origin">ASCII serialization</a> of the origin the provider uses
  for sign in. That is, Facebook would be represented by `https://www.facebook.com` and Google by
  `https://accounts.google.com`.

  This serialization of an [=origin=] does _not_ include a trailing U+002F SOLIDUS ("`/`"), but
  user agents SHOULD accept them silently: `https://accounts.google.com/` is clearly
  intended to be the same as `https://accounts.google.com`.

  # User Mediation # {#user-mediation}

  Exposing credential information to the web via an API has a number of potential impacts on user
  privacy. The user agent, therefore, MUST involve the user in a number of cases in order to ensure
  that they clearly understands what's going on, and with whom their credentials are being shared.

  We call a particular action <dfn export lt="user mediated|user mediation">user mediated</dfn> if
  it takes place after gaining a user's explicit consent. Consent might be expressed through a
  user's direct interaction with a [=credential chooser=] interface, for example. In general, [=user
  mediated=] actions will involve presenting the user some sort of UI, and asking them to make a
  decision.

  An action is unmediated if it takes place silently, without explicit user consent. For example,
  if a user configures their browser to grant persistent credential access to a particular origin,
  credentials may be provided without presenting the user with a UI requesting a decision.

  Here we'll spell out a few requirements that hold for all [=credential type registry/credential types=], but note that there's
  a good deal of latitude left up to the user agent (which is in a priviliged position to assist
  the user). Moreover, specific credential types may have distinct requirements that exceed the
  requirements laid out more generally here.

  ## Storing and Updating Credentials ## {#user-mediated-storage}

  Credential information is sensitive data, and users MUST remain in control of that information's
  storage. Inadvertent credential storage could, for instance, unexpectedly link a user's local
  profile on a particular device to a specific online persona. To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  1.  Credential information SHOULD NOT be stored or updated without [=user mediation=]. For
      example, the user agent could display a "Save this credential?" dialog box to the user in
      response to each call to {{store()}}. 

      User consent MAY be inferred if a user agent chooses to offer a persistant grant of consent
      in the form of an "Always save passwords" option (though we'd suggest that user agents should
      err on the side of something more narrowly scoped: perhaps "Always save _generated_
      passwords.", or "Always save passwords for this site.").

  2.  User agents SHOULD notify users when credentials are stored. This might take the form of an
      icon in the address bar, or some similar location.

  3.  User agents MUST allow users to manually remove stored credentials. This functionality might
      be implemented as a settings page, or via interaction with a notification as described above.

  ## Requiring User Mediation ## {#user-mediation-requirement}

  By default, [=user mediation=] is required for all [=origins=], as the relevant [=prevent silent
  access flag=] in the [=credential store=] is set to `true`. Users MAY choose to grant an
  origin persistent access to credentials (perhaps in the form of a "Stay signed into this site."
  option), which would set this flag to `false`. In this case, the user would always be signed into
  that site, which is desirable from the perspective of usability and convinience, but which
  might nevertheless have surprising implications (consider a user agent which syncs this flag's
  state across devices, for instance).

  To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  1.  User agents MUST allow users to require [=user mediation=] for a given origin or for all
      origins. This functionality might be implemented as a global toggle that overrides each
      origin's <a>`prevent silent access` flag</a> to return `false`, or via more granular
      settings for specific origins (or specific credentials on specific origins).

  2.  User agents MUST NOT set an [=origin=]'s <a>`prevent silent access` flag</a> to
      `false` without [=user mediation=]. For example, the [=credential chooser=] described in
      [[#user-mediated-selection]] could have a checkbox which the user could toggle to mark a
      credential as available without mediation for the origin, or the user agent could have an
      onboarding process for its credential manager which asked a user for a default setting.

  3.  User agents MUST notify users when credentials are provided to an origin. This could take the
      form of an icon in the address bar, or some similar location.

  4.  If a user clears her browsing data for an origin (cookies, localStorage, and so on), the user
      agent MUST set the <a>`prevent silent access` flag</a> to `true` for that origin.

  ## Credential Selection ## {#user-mediated-selection}

  When responding to a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} on an origin which requires
  [=user mediation=], user agents MUST ask the user for permission to share credential information.
  This SHOULD take the form of a <dfn export>credential chooser</dfn> which presents the user with a
  list of credentials that are available for use on a site, allowing them to select one which should
  be provided to the website, or to reject the request entirely.

  The chooser interface SHOULD be implemented in such a way as to be distinguishable from UI which a
  website could produce. For example, the chooser might overlap the user agent's UI in some
  unspoofable way.

  The chooser interface MUST include an indication of the origin which is requesting credentials.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include all {{Credential}} objects associated with the origin that
  requested credentials.

  User agents MAY internally associate information with each {{Credential}} object beyond the
  attributes specified in this document in order to enhance the utility of such a chooser. For
  example, favicons could help disambiguate identity providers, etc. Any additional information
  stored MUST not be exposed directly to the web.

  The chooser's behavior is not defined here: user agents are encouraged to experiment with UI
  treatments that educate users about their authentication options, and guide them through the
  process of choosing a credential to present. That said, the interface to the chooser is as
  follows:

  <section algorithm="ask the user to choose">
    The user agent can <dfn export abstract-op local-lt="ask to choose">ask the user to choose a
    `Credential`</dfn>, given a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} (|options|), and a set of
    {{Credential}} objects from the [=credential store=] (|locally discovered credentials|).

    This algorithm returns either `null` if the user chose not to share a credential with the site,
    a {{Credential}} object if the user chose a specific credential, or a {{Credential}} [=interface
    object=] if the user chose a type of credential.

    <div class="note">
      It seems reasonable for the chooser interface to display the list of |locally discovered
      credentials| to the user, perhaps something like this exceptionally non-normative mock:
  
      <img src="./mock-chooser.png" alt="A mockup of what a chooser might look like.">

      If the |options| provided is not <a>matchable <i lang="la">a priori</i></a>, then it might
      also make sense for the chooser interface to list the [=relevant credential interface
      objects=] for |options| that aren't covered by the list of explicit credentials. If, for
      instance, a site accepts webauthn-style authenticators, then "Security Key" might show up
      in the chooser list with an appropriate icon.

      Also, note that in some cases the user agent may skip the chooser entirely. For example, if
      the only [=relevant credential interface objects=] is one that itself requires user
      interaction, the user agent may return that interface directly, and rely on its internal
      mediation flow for user consent.

  # Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

  The following sections represent guidelines for various security and privacy considerations.
  Individual credential types may enforce stricter or more relaxed versions of these guidelines.

  ## Cross-domain credential access ## {#security-credential-access}

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise caution in determining
  when they can be safely shared with a website. The safest option is to restrict credential
  sharing to the exact origin on which they were saved. That is likely too restrictive for the
  web, however: consider sites which divide functionality into subdomains like `example.com` vs
  `admin.example.com`.

  As a compromise between annoying users, and securing their credentials, user agents:

  1.  MUST NOT share credentials between origins whose scheme components represent a downgrade in
      security. That is, it may make sense to allow credentials saved on `http://example.com/` to
      be made available to `https://example.com/` (in order to encourage developers to migrate to
      secure transport), but the inverse would be dangerous.

  2.  MAY use the Public Suffix List [[!PSL]] to determine the effective scope of a credential by
      comparing the [=registerable domain=] of the credential's {{Credential/[[origin]]}} with the
      origin in which {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called. That is: credentials saved on
      `https://admin.example.com/` and `https://example.com/` MAY be offered to users when
      {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called from `https://www.example.com/`, and vice versa.

  3.  MUST NOT offer credentials to an origin in response to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} without
      [=user mediation=] if the credential's origin is not an exact match for the calling origin.
      That is, {{Credential}} objects for `https://example.com` would not be returned directly to
      `https://www.example.com`, but could be offered to the user via the chooser.

  ## Credential Leakage ## {#security-leakage}

  Developers are well-advised to take
  some precautions to mitigate the risk that a cross-site scripting attack could turn into
  persistent access to a user's account by setting a reasonable Content Security Policy [[!CSP]]
  which restricts the endpoints to which data can be sent. In particular, developers should ensure
  that the following directives are set, explicitly or implicitly, in their pages' policies:

  *   <a>`script-src`</a> and <a>`object-src`</a> both restrict script execution on a page, making
      it less likely that a cross-site scripting attack will succeed in the first place. If sites
      are populating <{form}> elements, also <a>`form-action`</a> directives should be set.

  *   <a>`connect-src`</a> restricts the origins to which {{fetch()}} may submit data (which
      mitigates the risk that credentials could be exfiltrated to `evil.com`.

  *   <a>`child-src`</a> restricts the nested browsing contexts which may be embedded in a page,
      making it more difficult to inject a malicious `postMessage()` target. [[HTML]]

  Developers should, of course, also properly escape input and output, and consider using other
  layers of defense, such as Subresource Integrity [[SRI]] to further reduce risk.

  When defining specific credential types, specific credential types SHOULD give due consideration
  to the ways in which credential data can be transmitted over the wire. It might be reasonable,
  for example, to define transmission mechanisms which are restricted to same-origin endpoints.

  ## Insecure Sites ## {#insecure-sites}

  User agents MUST NOT expose the APIs defined here to environments which are not [=secure
  contexts=]. User agents might implement autofill mechanisms which store user credentials and fill
  sign-in forms on non-<a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URLs</a>, but those sites cannot
  be trusted to interact directly with the credential manager in any meaningful way, and those sites
  MUST NOT have access to credentials saved in [=secure contexts=].

  ## Origin Confusion ## {#security-origin-confusion}

  If framed pages have access to the APIs defined here, it might be possible to confuse a user into
  granting access to credentials for an origin other than the <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
  which is the only security origin which users can reasonably be expected to understand.

  This document exposes the Credential Management APIs to those contexts, as it's likely that some
  credential types will be straightforward to make available if user agents put enough thought and
  context into their UI.

  Specific credential types, however, will be difficult to expose in those contexts without risk.
  Those credential types are restricted via checks in their
  {{Credential/[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
  {{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
  {{Credential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}, and
  {{Credential/[[Store]](credential, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}
  methods, as appropriate.

  For example {{PasswordCredential}}'s
  {{PasswordCredential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}} method
  will immedietely return an empty set if called from inside a {{Worker}}, or a non-[=top-level
  browsing context=].

  ## Signing-Out ## {#security-signout}

  If a user has chosen to automatically sign-in to websites, as discussed in
  [[#user-mediation-requirement]], then the user agent will provide credentials to an origin
  whenever it asks for them. The website can instruct the user agent to suppress this behavior by
  calling {{CredentialsContainer}}'s {{CredentialsContainer/preventSilentAccess()}} method, which
  will turn off automatic sign-in for a given origin.

  The user agent relies on the website to do the right thing; an inattentive (or malicious) website
  could simply neglect to call this method, causing the user agent to continue providing credentials
  against the user's apparent intention. This is marginally worse than the status-quo of a site that
  doesn't clear user credentials when they click "Sign-out", as the user agent becomes complicit in
  the authentication.

  The user MUST have some control over this behavior. As noted in [[#user-mediation-requirement]],
  clearing cookies for an origin will also reset that origin's <a>`prevent silent access` flag</a>
  the [=credential store=] to `true`. Additionally, the user agent SHOULD provide some UI affordance
  for disabling automatic sign-in for a particular origin. This could be tied to the notification
  that credentials have been provided to an origin, for example.
</section>


<section>
  # Privacy Considerations # {#privacy-considerations}

  ## Timing Attacks ## {#security-timing}

  If the user has no credentials for an origin, a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} will
  resolve very quickly indeed. A malicious website could distinguish between a user with no
  credentials and a user with credentials who chooses not to share them.

  User agents SHOULD also rate-limit credential requests. It's almost certainly abusive for a page
  to request credentials more than a few times in a short period.

  ## Chooser Leakage ## {#security-chooser-leakage}

  If a user agent's [=credential chooser=] displays images supplied by an origin (for example, if a
  {{Credential}} displays a site's favicon), then, requests for these images MUST NOT be directly
  tied to instantiating the chooser in order to avoid leaking chooser usage. One option would be to
  fetch the images in the background when saving or updating a {{Credential}}, and to cache them for
  the lifetime of the {{Credential}}.

  These images MUST be fetched with the [=request/credentials mode=] set to "`omit`", the
  [=request/service-workers mode=] set to "`none`", the [=request/client=] set to `null`, the
  [=request/initiator=] set to the empty string, and the [=request/destination=] "`subresource`".

  Moreover, if the user agent allows the user to change either the name or icon associated with the
  credential, the alterations to the data SHOULD NOT be exposed to the website (consider a user who
  names two credentials for an origin "My fake account" and "My real account", for instance).

  ## Locally Stored Data ## {#security-local-data}

  This API offers an [=origin=] the ability to store data persistently along with a user's profile.
  Since most user agents treat credential data differently than "browsing data" (cookies, etc.)
  this might have the side effect of surprising a user who might believe that all traces of an
  origin have been wiped out when they clear their cookies.

  User agents SHOULD provide UI that makes it clear to a user that credential data is stored for an
  origin, and SHOULD make it easy for users to remove such data when they're no longer interested in
  keeping it around.

  # Implementation Considerations # {#implementation}

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  ## Website Authors ## {#implementation-authors}

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#290): Add some thoughts here about when and how the API
  should be used, especially with regard to {{CredentialRequestOptions/mediation}}.

  ISSUE: Describe encoding restrictions of submitting credentials by {{fetch()}} with
  a {{FormData}} body.

  When performing feature detection for a given credential type, developers are encouraged to verify
  that the relevant {{Credential}} specialization is present, rather than relying on the presence of
  `navigator.credentals`. The latter verifies the existence of the API itself, but does not ensure
  that the specific kind of credential necessary for a given site is supported. For example, if a
  given site requires passwords, checking `if (window.PasswordCredential)` is the most effective
  verification of support.

  ## Extension Points ## {#implementation-extension}

  This document provides a generic, high-level API that's meant to be extended with specific types
  of [=credentials=] that serve specific authentication needs. Doing so is, hopefully,
  straightforward:

  1.  Define a new interface that inherits from {{Credential}}:
 
      <div class="example"> 
        <pre>
          [Exposed=Window,
           SecureContext]
          interface ExampleCredential : Credential {
            // Definition goes here.
          };
        </pre>
      </div>

  1.  Define appropriate {{Credential/[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
      {{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}},
      {{Credential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}, and
      {{Credential/[[Store]](credential, sameOriginWithAncestors)}} methods on `ExampleCredential`'s
      [=interface object=]. {{Credential/[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}
      is appropriate for [=credentials=] that remain [=effective=] forever and
      can therefore simply be copied out of the [=credential store=], while
      {{Credential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}} is appropriate for
      [=credentials=] that need to be re-generated from a [=credential source=].

      Long-running operations, like those in {{PublicKeyCredential}}'s
      {{PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}} and
      {{PublicKeyCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}
      operations are encouraged to use <code>options.signal</code> to allow developers to abort
      the operation. See [[dom#abortcontroller-api-integration]] for detailed instructions.

      <div class="example">
        `ExampleCredential`'s `[[CollectFromCredentialStore]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)`
        internal method is called
        with an [=environment settings object/origin=] (`origin`), a CredentialRequestOptions
        object (`options`), and a boolean which is `true` iff the calling context is [=same-origin with its ancestors=].
        The algorithm returns a set of {{Credential}}
        objects that match the options provided. If no matching {{Credential}} objects are
        available, the returned set will be empty.

        1.  Assert: `options`[`example`] exists.

        2.  If `options`[`example`] is not truthy, return the empty set.

        3.  For each <i>credential</i> in the [=credential store=]:

            1.  ...
      </div>

  1.  Define the value of the `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=]'s {{[[type]]}} slot:

      <div class="example">
        The `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]` whose
        value is the string "`example`".
      </div>

  1.  Define the value of the `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=]'s {{[[discovery]]}} slot:

      <div class="example">
        The `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[discovery]]` whose
        value is "{{Credential/[[discovery]]/credential store}}".
      </div>

  1.  Extend {{CredentialRequestOptions}} with the options the new credential type needs to respond
      reasonably to {{get()}}:

      <div class="example">
        <pre>
          dictionary ExampleCredentialRequestOptions {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          partial dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
            ExampleCredentialRequestOptions example;
          };
        </pre>
      </div>

  1.  Extend {{CredentialCreationOptions}} with the data the new credential type needs to create
      `Credential` objects in response to {{create()}}:

      <div class="example">
        <pre>
          dictionary ExampleCredentialInit {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          partial dictionary CredentialCreationOptions {
            ExampleCredentialInit example;
          };
        </pre>
      </div>

  1.  If the new credential type supports {{CredentialMediationRequirement/conditional}} [=user
      mediation=], define `ExampleCredential/isConditionalMediationAvailable()`
      to return a new {{Promise}} that [=resolves=] with `true`.

  1.  Following the procedure in [[#sctn-registry-requirements]], add an entry to the
      [[#sctn-cred-type-registry|Credential Type Registry]] for the new
      "example" [=credential type registry/credential type=] and its corresponding:
      *   {{CredentialCreationOptions}}' and {{CredentialRequestOptions}}'
          [=credential type registry/Options Member Identifier=] (in this case it is "example"), and
      *   [=credential type registry/Appropriate Interface Object=] [=identifier=] (in this case it is
          <code>ExampleCredential</code>).

      Note: The [=credential type registry/credential type=]'s options dictionaries' [=credential type registry/Options Member Identifier=] must be the
      same in both {{CredentialCreationOptions}} and {{CredentialRequestOptions}}, and should be
      the same as the [=credential/credential type=] value in the {{Credential}} [=interface object=]'s {{[[type]]}} slot.

  You might also find that new primitives are necessary. For instance, you might want to return
  many {{Credential}} objects rather than just one in some sort of complicated, multi-factor
  sign-in process. That might be accomplished in a generic fashion by adding a `getAll()` method to
  {{CredentialsContainer}} which returned a `sequence<Credential>`, and defining a reasonable
  mechanism for dealing with requesting credentials of distinct types.

  For any such extension, we recommend getting in touch with
  <a href="mailto:public-webappsec@w3.org">public-webappsec@</a> for consultation and review.

  ## Browser Extensions ## {#browser-extensions}

  Ideally, user agents that implement an extension system of some sort will
  allow third-parties to hook into these API endpoints in order to improve
  the behavior of third party credential management software in the same way
  that user agents can improve their own via this imperative approach.

  This could range from a complex new API that the user agent mediates, or
  simply by allowing extensions to overwrite the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}
  and {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} endpoints for their own purposes.

  # Future Work # {#teh-futur}

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The API defined here does the bare minimum to expose user agent's credential managers to the web,
  and allows the web to help those credential managers understand when federated identity providers
  are in use. The next logical step will be along the lines sketched in documents like [[WEB-LOGIN]]
  (and, to some extent, Mozilla's BrowserID [[BROWSERID]]).

  The user agent is in the unique position of being able to effectively mediate the relationship
  between users, identity providers, and websites. If the user agent can remove some of the risk and
  confusion associated with the typical authentication flows, users will be in a significantly
  better position than today.

  A natural way to expose this information might be to extend the {{FederatedCredential}} interface
  with properties like authentication tokens, and possibly to add some form of manifest format with
  properties that declare the authentication type which the provider supports.

  The API described here is designed to be extensible enough to support use cases that require user
  interaction, perhaps with websites other than the one which requested credentials. We hope that
  the Promise-based system we've settled on is extensible enough to support these kinds of
  asynchronous flows which could require some level of interaction between multiple browsing
  contexts (e.g. mediated activity on <code>idp.com</code> might resolve a Promise handed back to
  <code>rp.com</code>) or between devices and user agents (e.g. [[WEBAUTHN]]) in the future without
  redesigning the API from the ground up.

  Baby steps.
