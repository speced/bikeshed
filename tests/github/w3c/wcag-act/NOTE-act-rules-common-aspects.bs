Common Aspects {#input-aspects-common}
--------------------------------------

### HTTP Messages ### {#input-aspects-http}

The HTTP messages [[http11]] exchanged between a client and a server as part of requesting a web page may be of interest to ACT Rules. For example, analyzing HTTP messages to perform validation of HTTP headers or unparsed HTML [[HTML]] and CSS [[CSS2]].

### DOM Tree ### {#input-aspects-dom}

The DOM [[DOM]] tree constructed from parsing HTML [[HTML]], and optionally executing DOM manipulating JavaScript, may be of interest to ACT Rules to test the structure of web pages. In the DOM tree, information about individual elements of a web page, and their relations, becomes available.

The means by which the DOM tree is constructed, be it by a web browser or not, is not of importance as long as the construction follows the [Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org) [[DOM]].

### CSS Styling ### {#input-aspects-css}

The computed CSS [[CSS2]] styling resulting from parsing CSS and applying it to the DOM [[DOM]] may be of interest to ACT Rules that wish to test the web page as presented to the user. Through CSS styling, information about the position, the foreground and background colors, the visibility, and more, of elements becomes available.

The means by which the CSS styling is computed, be it by a web browser or not, is not of importance as long as the computation follows any applicable specifications that might exist, such as the [CSS Object Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/) [[CSSOM]].

### Accessibility Tree ### {#input-aspects-accessibility}

The accessibility tree constructed from extracting information from both the DOM [[DOM]] tree and the CSS [[CSS2]] styling may be of interest to ACT Rules. This can be used to test the web page as presented to assistive technologies such as screen readers. Through the accessibility tree, information about the semantic roles, accessible names and descriptions, and more, of elements becomes available.

The means by which the accessibility tree is constructed, be it by a web browser or not, is not of importance as long as the construction follows any applicable specifications that might exist, such as the [Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/) [[CORE-AAM-1.1]].

### Language ### {#input-aspects-text}

Language, either written or spoken, contained in nodes of the DOM [[DOM]] or accessibility trees may be of interest to ACT Rules that intend to test things like complexity or intention of the language. For example, an ACT Rule might test that paragraphs of text within the DOM tree do not exceed a certain readability score or that the text alternative of an image provides a sufficient description.

The means by which the language is assessed, whether by a person or a machine, is not of importance as long as the assessment meets the criteria defined in [[wcag2-tech-req#humantestable]] [[WCAG]].
