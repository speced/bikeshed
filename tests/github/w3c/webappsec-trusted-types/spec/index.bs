# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is not normative.*

Certain classes of vulnerabilities occur when a web application
takes a value from an attacker-controlled source (e.g. the
document URL parameter, or postMessage channel) and passes that value,
without appropriate sanitization to one of the
[[#injection-sinks|injection sinks]] - various Web API functions with
powerful capabilities.

These types of issues are traditionally difficult to prevent.
Applications commonly call those injection sinks with attacker-controlled
values without authors realizing it, since it's not clear if the
input was attacker-controlled when invoking the injection sink.
Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript it's also difficult to ascertain
that such pattern is not present in a given program. It is often missed
during manual code reviews, and automated code analysis. As an example,
if `aString` contains untrusted data, `foo[bar] = aString` is a statement
that potentially can trigger a vulnerability, depending on a value
of `foo` and `bar`.

This document focuses on prevening DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting
that occurs when attacker-controlled data reaches
[[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]], as that eventually causes execution of the
script payload controlled by the attacker. DOM XSS is prevalent in the
web applications as there are over 60 different
injection sinks (e.g. `Element.innerHTML`, or `Location.href` setters).

This document defines [[#trusted-types|Trusted Types]] - an API that allows applications
to lock down [=injection sinks=] to only accept non-spoofable, typed values
in place of strings. These values can in turn only be created from
application-defined [=policies=], allowing the authors to define rules
guarding dangerous APIs, reducing the attack surface to small, isolated parts
of the web application codebase, which are substantially easier to safeguard,
monitor and review.





## Goals ## {#goals}

*   Minimize the likelihood of client-side vulnerabilities that occur when
    calling powerful Web APIs with untrusted data - for example,
    minimize the likelihood of DOM XSS.

*   Encourage a design in which security decisions are
    encapsulated within a small part of the application.

*   Reduce security review surface for complex web application
    codebases.

*   Allow the detection of vulnerabilities similar to how regular
    programming errors are detected and surfaced to the developers, with the
    assist of dynamic and static analysis tools.

## Non-goals ## {#non-goals}

*   Prevent, or mitigate the result of injections into server-side generated
    markup, in specific reflections into the body of the scripts running in a
    document. To address server-side XSS vectors, we recommend existing
    solutions like templating systems or [[CSP3|CSP]]
    [=script-src=].
*   Address resource confinement, e.g. to prevent data exfiltration, or
    connecting to external sources via [[Fetch]].
*   Control subresource loading. Trusted Types aim to allow the authors to
    control loading resources that can script the current document, but not
    other subresources.
*   Prevent *cross-origin* JavaScript execution (for example, Trusted Types
    don't guard loading new documents with JavaScript code via `data:` URLs).
*   Prevent malicious authors of the web application's JavaScript code
    from being able to bypass the restrictions; attempting to protect against
    malicious authors would result in an overtly complex and not-practical
    design.

## Use cases ## {#use-cases}

*   An author maintains a complex web application written in a framework
    that uses a secure templating system to generate the UI
    components. The application also depends on 3rd party client-side
    libraries that perform auxiliary tasks (e.g. analytics, performance
    monitoring). To ensure that none of these components introduce DOM
    XSS vulnerabilities, author defines a Trusted Type policy in the
    templating library and enables the enforcement for the [=DOM XSS injection sinks=].

*   An existing web application interacts with the DOM mostly using XSS-safe
    patterns (i.e. withour using [=DOM XSS injection sinks=]). In a few places,
    however, it resorts to using risky patterns like loading additional script using
    JSONP, calling into `innerHTML` or `eval`.

    Review finds that those places do not cause XSS (e.g. because
    user-controlled data is not part of the input to those sinks), but it's
    hard to migrate the application off using these patterns.

    As such, CSP cannot be enforced on this application (without resorting to
    an unsafe version using `'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'`). Additionally,
    it's possible some codebase with DOM XSS flaws was not included in a review,
    or will be introduced in the future.

    To address this risk, the author converts the reviewed parts to using
    Trusted Types, and enables Trusted Type [=enforcement=]. Addditional places
    using the injection sinks, should they exist in the future, are correctly
    blocked and reported.

*   A security team is tasked with assuring that the client-side heavy
    application code does not contain XSS vulnerabilities. Since the server side
    code is homogeneous (it's moslty an API backend), and the application
    enforces Trusted Types, the review only focuses on the Trusted Type
    [=policies=] and their rules. Later on the reviewed policy names are
    allowed in the 'trusted-types' CSP directive, safe for the developers to
    use.

    Any additonal code, including the code of often-changing dependencies,
    can be excluded from the review, unless it creates a Trusted Type policy.
    Without it, the code cannot cause a DOM XSS.

# Framework # {#framework}

## Injection sinks ## {#injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

An <dfn>injection sink</dfn> is a powerful Web API function that should only
be called with trusted, validated or appropriately sanitized input.
Calling the injection sink with attacker-controlled (i.e. injected) inputs
has undesired consequences and is considered a security vulnerability.

Note: The exact list of injection sinks covered by this document is defined in
[[#integrations]].

It's difficult to determine if a given application contains such a
vulnerability (e.g. if it is vulnerable to DOM XSS) only by analyzing
the invocations of [=injection sinks=], as their inputs (usually strings)
do not carry the information about their provenance. For example, while
the application might intentionally call `eval()` with dynamically created
inputs (e.g. for code obfuscation purposes), calling `eval()` on strings
supplied by the attacker is definitely a security vulnerability - but
it's not easy to distinguish one from the other.

This document organizes the injection sinks into groups, based on the
capabilities that sinks in a given group have. [=Enforcement=] for groups is controlled via <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> values.

### HTML injection sinks ### {#html-injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

HTML <a>injection sinks</a> parse input strings into a DOM tree. Since HTML parsers
can create arbitrary elements, including scripts, and set arbitrary attributes,
enabling the [=enforcement=] of any <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> also implies
enforcing types for HTML injection sinks.

Examples of HTML injection sinks include:

  * Functions that parse & insert HTML strings into the document like
    [[DOM-Parsing#widl-Element-innerHTML|Element.innerHTML]],
    [[DOM-Parsing#widl-Element-outerHTML|Element.outerHTML]] setter, or {{Document/write|Document.write}}.
  * Functions that create a new same-origin {{Document}} with caller-controlled
    markup like {{DOMParser/parseFromString()}},

### DOM XSS injection sinks ### {#dom-xss-injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

DOM XSS <a>injection sinks</a>  evaluate an input string value in a way that could
result in DOM XSS if that value is untrusted.

Examples of include:

  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a URL of the code to load
    like {{HTMLScriptElement/src!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.src}},
  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a code to execute like
    {{HTMLScriptElement/text!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.text}},
  * Functions that execute code directly like `eval`,
  * Navigation to 'javascript:' URLs.

Guarding DOM XSS injection sinks is controlled by the <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> named 'script'.

## Trusted Types ## {#trusted-types}

To allow the authors to control values reaching injection sinks,
we introduce [[#trusted-types]]. The following list of
<dfn>Trusted Type</dfn>s indicating that a given value is
trusted by the authors to be used with an [=injection sink=] in a certain context.

Note: **Trusted** in this context signifies the fact that the application author
is confident that a given value can be safely used with an injection sink - she
*trusts* it does not introduce a vulnerability. That does not imply that the
value is indeed *safe*.

Note: This allows the authors to specify the intention when creating a given
value, and the user agents to introduce checks based on the type of
such value to preserve the authors' intent. For example, if
authors intend a value to be used as an HTML snippet, an attempt to
load a script from that value would fail.

Note: All Trusted Types wrap over an immutable string, specified when the
objects are created. These objects are unforgeable in a sense that
there is no JavaScript-exposed way to replace the inner string value
of a given object - it's stored in an internal slot with no setter
exposed.

Note: All Trusted Types stringifiers return the inner string value.
This makes it easy to incrementally migrate the application code into using
Trusted Types in place of DOM strings (it's possible to start
producing types in parts of the application, while still using and
accepting strings in other parts of the codebase). In that sense,
Trusted Types are backwards-compatible with the regular DOM APIs.

### <dfn type>TrustedHTML</dfn> ### {#trusted-html}

The TrustedHTML interface represents a string that a developer can
confidently insert into an [=injection sink=] that will render it as HTML.
These objects are immutable
wrappers around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createHTML(input)|createHTML}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
interface TrustedHTML {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedHTML objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
DOMString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedHTML object, return the DOMString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.

### <dfn type>TrustedScript</dfn> ### {#trusted-script}

The TrustedScript interface represents a string with an uncompiled
script body that a developer can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=]
that might lead to executing that script.
These objects are immutable wrappers
around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScript(input)|createScript}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
interface TrustedScript {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedScript objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
DOMString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedScript object, return the DOMString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.


### <dfn type>TrustedScriptURL</dfn> ### {#trused-script-url}

The TrustedScriptURL interface represents a string that a developer
can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=] that will parse it as a URL of
an external script resource.
These objects are immutable wrappers around a
string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScriptURL(input)|createScriptURL}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
interface TrustedScriptURL {
  stringifier;
};
</pre>

TrustedScriptURL objects have a `[[Data]]` internal slot which holds a
USVString. The slot's value is set when the object is created, and
will never change during its lifetime.

To stringify a TrustedScriptURL object, return the USVString from its
`[[Data]]` internal slot.


## <dfn>Policies</dfn> ## {#policies-hdr}

Trusted Types can only be created via user-defined
and immutable policies that define rules for converting a string into
a given Trusted Type object. Policies allows the authors to specify custom,
programmatic rules that Trusted Types must adhere to.

<div class="example" id="sanitizing-policy">
Authors may define a
policy that will sanitize an HTML string, allowing only a subset of
tags and attributes that are known not to cause JavaScript
execution. Any {{TrustedHTML}} object created through this policy can then
be safely used in the application, and e.g. passed to `innerHTML`
setter - even if the input value was controlled by the attacker, the
policy rules neutralized it to adhere to policy-specific
contract.
<xmp highlight=js>
const sanitizingPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('sanitize-html', {
  createHTML: (input) => myTrustedSanitizer(input, { superSafe: 'ok'}),
});

myDiv.innerHTML = sanitizingPolicy.createHTML(untrustedValue);
</xmp>
</div>

Note: [=Trusted Type=] objects wrap values that are explicitly trusted by
the author. As such, creating a Trusted Type object instance becomes a de
facto [=injection sink=], and hence code that creates a Trusted Type
instances is security-critical. To allow for strict control over Trusted Type
object creation we don't expose the constructors of those
directly, but require authors to create them via [=policies=].

Multiple policies can be created in a given [=Realm=], allowing the
applications to define different rules for different parts of the
codebase.

<div class="example" id="policy-reference">
Library initialized with a policy allowing it to load additional scripts from
a given host.
<xmp highlight=js>

const cdnScriptsPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('cdn-scripts', {
  createScriptURL(url) {
    const parsed = new URL(url, document.baseURI);
    if (parsed.origin == 'https://mycdn.example') {
      return url;
    }
    throw new TypeError('invalid URL');
  },
});

myLibrary.init({policy: cdnScriptsPolicy});
</xmp>
</div>

Note: Trusted Type objects can only be created via policies. If
[=enforcement=] is enabled, only the policy code can trigger an action
of an [=injection sink=] and hence call-sites of the policies' `create*`
functions are the *only* security-sensitive code in the entire program
with regards to the actions of the [=injection sinks=].
Only this typically small subset of the entire code base needs to be
security-reviewed - there's no need to monitor or review
the [=injection sinks=] themselves, as User Agents [=enforcement|enforce=] that
those sinks will only accept matching Trusted Type objects, and these in turn
can only be created via policies.

The {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()|createPolicy}} function returns a policy object which `create*` functions
will create Trusted Type objects after applying the policy
rules.

Note: While it's safe to freely use a policy that sanitizes its input anywhere in the application,
there might be a need to create lax policies to be used internally, and only to be
called with author-controlled input. For example, a client-side HTML
templating library, an HTML sanitizer library, or a JS asynchronous
code plugin loading subsystem each will likely need full control over
HTML or URLs. The API design facilitates that - each policy may only
be used if the callsite can obtain a reference to the policy (a return
value from {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()}}). As such, policy
references can be treated as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a>,
access to which can be controlled using JavaScript techniques
(e.g. via closures, internal function variables, or modules).

<div class="example" id="policy-capability">
Unsafe no-op policy reachable only from within a single code block to ascertain
that it's called only with no attacker-controlled values.
<xmp highlight=js>
(function renderFootnote() {
  const unsafePolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('html', {
    createHTML: input => input,
  });
  const footnote = await fetch('/footnote.html').then(r => r.text());
  footNote.innerHTML = unsafePolicy.createHTML(footnote);
})();
</xmp>
</div>

### <dfn type>TrustedTypePolicyFactory</dfn> ### {#trusted-type-policy-factory}

TrustedTypePolicyFactory creates
{{TrustedTypePolicy|policies}} and verifies that Trusted Type object instances
were created via one of the policies.

Note: This factory object is exposed to JavaScript through `window.trustedTypes`
reference - see [[#extensions-to-the-window-interface]].

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext] interface TrustedTypePolicyFactory {
    TrustedTypePolicy createPolicy(
        DOMString policyName, optional TrustedTypePolicyOptions policyOptions);
    boolean isHTML(any value);
    boolean isScript(any value);
    boolean isScriptURL(any value);
    readonly attribute TrustedHTML emptyHTML;
    readonly attribute TrustedScript emptyScript;
    DOMString? getAttributeType(
        DOMString tagName,
        DOMString attribute,
        optional DOMString elementNs = "",
        optional DOMString attrNs = "");
    DOMString? getPropertyType(
        DOMString tagName,
        DOMString property,
        optional DOMString elementNs = "");
    readonly attribute TrustedTypePolicy? defaultPolicy;
};
</pre>

Internal slot `[[DefaultPolicy]]` may contain a {{TrustedTypePolicy}} object,
and is initially empty.

Internal slot `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]` is an <a>ordered set</a> of strings,
initially empty.

<div dfn-type="method" dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicyFactory">

:   <dfn>createPolicy(policyName, policyOptions)</dfn>
::  Creates a policy object that will implement the rules
    passed in the {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} |policyOptions| object.
    The allowed policy names may be restricted by [[#content-security-policy-hdr|Content Security Policy]].
    If the policy name is not on the whitelist defined in the [=trusted-types-directive|trusted-types=] CSP directive,
    the policy creation fails with a [[WebIDL-1#idl-Error|TypeError]].
    Also, if unique policy names are enforced (i.e. `'allow-duplicates'` is not used),
    and `createPolicy` is called more than once with any given `policyName`,
    policy creation fails with a TypeError.

    <div class="example" id="create-policy-example">
    <xmp highlight=js>
    // HTTP Response header: Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types foo
    trustedTypes.createPolicy("foo", {}); // ok.

: <dfn>isHTML(value)</dfn>
:: Returns true if value is an instance of {{TrustedHTML}} and has its `[[Data]]`  internal slot set, false otherwise.

    Note: `is*` functions are used to check if a given object is truly a legitimate

    policies). This is to be able to detect a forgery of the objects via
    e.g. [[ECMASCRIPT#sec-object.create|Object.create]]
    or prototype chains manipulation.

### <dfn type>TrustedTypePolicy</dfn> ### {#trusted-type-policy}

Policy objects implement a TrustedTypePolicy interface and define a
group of functions creating Trusted Type objects.
Each of the `create*` functions converts a string value to a given Trusted Type variant, or
throws a TypeError if a conversion of a given value is disallowed.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
interface TrustedTypePolicy {
  readonly attribute DOMString name;
  TrustedHTML createHTML(DOMString input, any... arguments);
  TrustedScript createScript(DOMString input, any... arguments);
  TrustedScriptURL createScriptURL(DOMString input, any... arguments);
};
</pre>

Each policy has a <dfn dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicy">name</dfn>.

Each TrustedTypePolicy object has an `[[options]]` internal slot, holding the {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} object describing the actual behavior of the policy.

<div dfn-type="method" dfn-for="TrustedTypePolicy">

### <dfn type>TrustedTypePolicyOptions</dfn> ### {#trusted-type-policy-options}

This dictionary holds author-defined functions for converting string
values into trusted values. These functions do not create [=Trusted Type=]
object instances directly - this behavior is provided by
{{TrustedTypePolicy}}.

<pre class="idl">
dictionary TrustedTypePolicyOptions {
   CreateHTMLCallback? createHTML;
   CreateScriptCallback? createScript;
   CreateScriptURLCallback? createScriptURL;
};
callback CreateHTMLCallback = DOMString (DOMString input, any... arguments);
callback CreateScriptCallback = DOMString (DOMString input, any... arguments);
callback CreateScriptURLCallback = USVString (DOMString input, any... arguments);
</pre>

### <dfn>Default policy</dfn> ### {#default-policy-hdr}

*This section is not normative.*

One of the policies, the policy with a [=TrustedTypePolicy/name=] `"default"`, is special;
When an [=injection sink=] is passed a string (instead of a
Trusted Type object), this policy will be implicitly called by
the user agent with the string value as the first argument, and the sink name
as a second argument.

This allows the application to define a fallback behavior to use instead of
causing a violation. The intention is to allow the applications to recover from
an unexpected data flow, and sanitize the
potentially attacker-controlled string "as a last resort", or reject a value
if a safe value cannot be created. Errors thrown from within a policy are
propagated to the application.

If the default policy doesn't exist, or if its appropriate `create*` function
returns *null* or *undefined*, it will cause a CSP violation. In the
enforcing mode, an error will be thrown, but in report-only the original value
passed to the default policy will be used.

Note: This optional behavior allows for introducing Trusted Type [=enforcement=]
to applications that are still using legacy code that uses injection sinks.
Needless to say, this policy should
necessarily be defined with very strict rules not to bypass the security
restrictions in unknown parts of the application. In an extreme
case, a lax, no-op default policy defeats all the benefits of using Trusted Types
to protect access to [=injection sinks=]. If possible,
authors should resort to a default policy in a transitional period
only, use it to detect and rewrite their dependencies that use injection
sinks unsafely and eventually phase out the usage of the default policy entirely.

Note: See [[#get-trusted-type-compliant-string-algorithm]] for details on how
the default policy is applied.

<div class="example" id="default-policy-example">
<xmp highlight="js">
// Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types default; require-trusted-types-for 'script'

trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
  createScriptURL: (s, sink) => {
    console.log("Please refactor.");
    return s + "?default-policy-used&sink=" + encodeURIComponent(sink);
  }
});

aScriptElement.src = "https://cdn.example/script.js";
// Please refactor.
console.log(aScriptElement.src);
// https://cdn.example/script.js?default-policy-used&sink=script.src
</xmp>
</div>


## <dfn>Enforcement</dfn> ## {#enforcement-hdr}

Note: Enforcement is the process of checking that a value
has an appropriate type before it reaches an [=injection sink=].

The JavaScript API that allows authors to create policies and Trusted Types objects from them is always
available (via {{Window/trustedTypes}}). Since [=injection sinks=] stringify their security sensitive
arguments, and [=Trusted Type=] objects stringify to their inner string values, this allows the authors
to use Trusted Types in place of strings.

To secure the access to [=injection sinks=], on top of the JavaScript code using the Trusted Types,
the user agent needs to enforce them i.e. assert that the injection sinks from a given group are *never*
called with string values, and Trusted Type values are used instead. This section describes how authors
may control this enforcing behavior.

Authors may also control their [=policies=] by specifying rules around policy creation.

### Content Security Policy ### {#content-security-policy-hdr}

Applications may control Trusted Type enforcement via [[CSP#policy-delivery|configuring a Content Security Policy]]. This document defines new directives that correspond to Trusted Types rules.
The [[#require-trusted-types-for-csp-directive|require-trusted-types-for]] directive specifies the [=injection sinks=] groups, for which the types should be required. The [[#trusted-types-csp-directive|trusted-types]] directive controls how [=policies=] can be created.

Note: Using CSP mechanisms allows the authors to prepare their application for enforcing Trusted Types
via using the {{CSP#cspro-header|Content-Security-Report-Only}} HTTP Response header.

Note: Most of the enforcement rules are defined as modifications of the
algorithms in other specifications, see [[#integrations]].

# Algorithms # {#algorithms}

## <dfn abstract-op>Create a Trusted Type Policy</dfn> ## {#create-trusted-type-policy-algorithm}

To create a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}, given a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} (|factory|),
a string (|policyName|), {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} dictionary (|options|), and a
[=Realm/global object=] (|global|) run these steps:

1.  Let |allowedByCSP| be the result of executing [$Should Trusted Type policy
    creation be blocked by Content Security Policy?$] algorithm with |global|,
    |policyName| and |factory|'s `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]` slot value.
1.  If |allowedByCSP| is `"Blocked"`, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort further steps.
1.  If |policyName| is `default` and the |factory|'s `[[DefaultPolicy]]` slot
    value is not empty, throw a {{TypeError}} and abort further steps.
1.  Let |policy| be a new {{TrustedTypePolicy}} object.
1.  Set |policy|'s `name` property value to |policyName|.
1.  Let |policyOptions| be a new {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions}} object.
1.  Set |policyOptions|
    {{TrustedTypePolicy/createHTML()|createHTML}} property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createHTML|createHTML}} property value.
1.  Set |policyOptions| {{TrustedTypePolicy/createScript()|createScript}}
    property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createScript|createScript}} property value.
1.  Set |policyOptions| {{TrustedTypePolicy/createScriptURL()|createScriptURL}}
    property to |option|'s
    {{TrustedTypePolicyOptions/createScriptURL|createScriptURL}} property value.
1.  Set |policy|'s `[[options]]` internal slot value to *policyOptions*.
1.  If the |policyName| is `default`, set the |factory|'s `[[DefaultPolicy]]` slot value to |policy|.
1.  Append |policyName| to |factory|'s `[[CreatedPolicyNames]]`.
1.  Return |policy|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Create a Trusted Type</dfn> ## {#create-a-trusted-type-algorithm}

Given a {{TrustedTypePolicy}} |policy|, a type name |trustedTypeName|,
a string |value| and a list |arguments|, execute the following steps:

1.  Let |functionName| be a function name for the given |trustedTypeName|,
    based on the following table:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Function name</th>
        <th>Trusted Type name </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createHTML"</td>
        <td>"TrustedHTML"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createScript"</td>
        <td>"TrustedScript"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"createScriptURL"</td>
        <td>"TrustedScriptURL"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  Let |options| be the value of |policy|'s `[[options]]` slot.
1.  Let |function| be the value of the property in |options| named |functionName|.
1.  If |function| is `null`, throw a {{TypeError}}.
1.  Let |policyValue| be the result of invoking |function| with
    |value| as a first argument, items of |arguments| as subsequent arguments,
    and [[ECMASCRIPT#sec-method|callback **this** value]] set to `null`.
1.  If |policyValue| is an error, return |policyValue| and abort the following steps.
1.  If |policy|'s [=TrustedTypePolicy/name=] is `"default"` and the |policyValue|
    is null or undefined, return |policyValue|.

    Note: This is used in a [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm to signal that
    a value was rejected.
1.  Let |dataString| be the result of stringifying |policyValue|.
1.  Let |trustedObject| be a new instance of an interface with a type
    name |trustedTypeName|, with its `[[Data]]` internal slot value
    set to |dataString|.
1.  Return |trustedObject|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Get Trusted Type compliant string</dfn> ## {#get-trusted-type-compliant-string-algorithm}

This algorithm will return a string that can be used with an
[=injection sink=], optionally unwrapping it from a matching [=Trusted Type=].
It will ensure that the Trusted Type [=enforcement=] rules were respected.

Given a {{TrustedType}} type (|expectedType|), a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|),
{{TrustedType}} or a string (|input|), a string (|sink|) and a string (|sinkGroup|), run these steps:

1.  Assert: |global| is a {{Window}}.

    Issue: Synchronize when TT are added to workers (perhaps use "has a CSP list"?)
1.  Let |cspList| be the |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>.
1.  If |cspList| does not contain a [=content security policy object|policy=]
    which [=directive set=] containing a [=directive=] with a name `"require-trusted-types-for"`,
    or that directive does not contain a <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> which is a match for a value |sinkGroup|,
    return stringified |input| and abort these steps.
1.  If |input| has type |expectedType|, return stringified
    |input| and abort these steps.
1.  Let |convertedInput| be the result of executing [$Process value with a default policy$] with the same arguments as this algorithm.
1.  If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error and abort the following steps.
1.  If |convertedInput| is `null` or `undefined`, execute the following steps:
    1.  Let |disposition| be the result of executing [$Should sink type mismatch violation be blocked by Content Security Policy?$] algorithm,
        passing |global|, |input| as |source|, |sinkGroup| and |sink|.
    1.  If |disposition| is `“Allowed”`, return stringified |input| and abort futher steps.

        Note: This step assures that the default policy rejection will be reported, but ignored in a report-only mode.
    1. Throw a {{TypeError}} and abort further steps.
1. Assert: |convertedInput| has type |expectedType|.
1. Return stringified |convertedInput|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Process value with a default policy</dfn> ## {#process-value-with-a-default-policy-algorithm}

This algorithm routes a value to be assigned to an [=injection sink=]  through a default policy, should one exist.

Given a {{TrustedType}} type (|expectedType|), a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|),
{{TrustedType}} or a string (|input|), and a string (|sink|), run these steps:

1.  Let |defaultPolicy| be the value of |global|'s [=Window/trusted type policy factory=]'s `[[DefaultPolicy]]` slot. If the slot is empty, return `null`.
1.  Let |convertedInput| be the result of executing [$Create a
    Trusted Type$] algorithm, with the following arguments:
    *  |defaultPolicy| as |policy|
    *  |input| as |value|
    *  |expectedType|’s type name as |trustedTypeName|
    *  &laquo; |sink| &raquo; as |arguments|
1. If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow it. Otherwise, return |convertedInput|.

## <dfn abstract-op>Prepare the script URL and text</dfn> ## {#prepare-script-url-and-text}

Given a {{script}} (|script|), this algorithm performs the following steps:

1.  If |script| does not have a {{script/src}} content attribute, set its {{script/[[ScriptURL]]}} internal slot value to `null`.

1.  Otherwise, if |script|'s {{script/[[ScriptURL]]}} internal slot value is not equal to its {{script/src}} attribute value,
    set |script|'s {{script/[[ScriptURL]]}} to the result of executing [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$], with the following arguments:
      * {{TrustedScriptURL}} as |expectedType|,
      * |script|'s {{Document}}'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|,
      * |script|'s {{script/src}} attribute value as |input|,
      * `HTMLScriptElement src` as |sink|,
      * `'script'` as |sinkGroup|.

    If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error and abort further steps.

1.  If |script|'s {{script/[[ScriptText]]}} internal slot value is not equal to its [=child text content=],
    set |script|'s {{script/[[ScriptText]]}} to the result of executing [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$], with the following arguments:
      * {{TrustedScriptURL}} as |expectedType|,
      * |script|'s {{Document}}'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|,
      * |script|'s [=child text content=] attribute value,
      * `HTMLScriptElement text` as |sink|,
      * `'script'` as |sinkGroup|.

    If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error.

## Integration with WebIDL ## {#webidl-integration}

Issue: Keep in sync with https://github.com/heycam/webidl/pull/841.

### [StringContext] ### {#webidl-string-context-xattr}

This specification defines a new [{{StringContext}}] [=extended attribute=].

If the [{{StringContext}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on {{DOMString}} or {{USVString}}, it
modifies how the value is converted to the IDL type, causing additional value validation to
adhere to the context the string is used in.

The [{{StringContext}}] extended attribute must [=takes an identifier|take an identifier=]. The [=identifier=]
must be one of {{TrustedHTML}}, {{TrustedScript}} and {{TrustedScriptURL}}.

Issue: Make sure this is OK, otherwise use strings and convert them to TrustedXYZ in this spec only.

[{{StringContext}}] extended attribute may only annotate a type of a [=regular attribute=] or
a [=regular operation=] argument. A type annotated with the [{{StringContext}}]
extended attribute must not appear in a [=read only=] attribute. The [=regular attribute=] or
a [=regular operation=] argument that the type annotated with the [{{StringContext}}] extended
attribute appears in is its <dfn>related construct</dfn>.

A type that is not {{DOMString}} or {{USVString}} must not be [=extended attributes associated with|associated with=]
the [{{StringContext}}] extended attribute.

See the rules for converting ECMAScript values to the IDL types in [[webidl#es-DOMString]]
for the specific requirements that the use of [{{StringContext}}] entails.

<div class="example" id="webidl-stringcontext-example">

    In the following [=IDL fragment=],
    a [=variadic=] [=operation=] is declared
    that uses the [{{StringContext}}] [=extended attribute=]
    on all its arguments:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface Document {
          void write([StringContext=html] DOMString... text);
        };
    </pre>

### Extended attributes applicable to types ### {#webidl-applicable-to-types}

The following extended attributes are <dfn for="extended attributes">applicable to types</dfn>:
 [{{AllowShared}}],
 [{{Clamp}}],
 [{{EnforceRange}}]<ins>,
 [{{StringContext}}]</ins> and
 [{{TreatNullAs}}].

### Type conversion ### {#webidl-type-conversion}

This specification modifies the algorithm implementing the conversion to DOMString in [[webidl#es-DOMString]]:

An ECMAScript value |V| is [=converted to an IDL value|converted=]
to an IDL {{DOMString}} value by running the following algorithm:

  1.  <ins>If the conversion is to an IDL type [=extended attribute associated with|associated with=] the
      [{{StringContext}}] extended attribute, then set |V| to the result of [=validate the string in context=], passing
      [=this=], |V|, the {{StringContext}} extended attribute [=identifier=], and the [=identifier=]
      of the [{{StringContext}}] extended attribute [=related construct=].

      Note: That algorithm may [=ECMAScript/throw=] a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}}.
      </ins>
  1.  If |V| is <emu-val>null</emu-val> and the conversion is to an IDL type
      [=extended attribute associated with|associated with=] the [{{TreatNullAs}}] extended
      attribute, then return the {{DOMString}} value that represents the empty string.
  1.  Let |x| be <a abstract-op>ToString</a>(|V|).
  1.  Return the IDL {{DOMString}} value that represents the same sequence of code units as the one the ECMAScript String value |x| represents.

### Validate the string in context ### {#webidl-validate-the-string-in-context}

This specification adds a following section to [[webidl#es-security]].

Certain algorithms in [[webidl#es-type-mapping]] are defined to
<dfn id="dfn-validate-the-string-in-context" export>validate the string in context</dfn> on a given
value. This check is used to determine whether a given value
is appropriate for its {{StringContext}}. This validation takes the following four inputs:

1.  the [=platform object=] on
    which the operation invocation or attribute access is being done,
1.  the value to validate,
1.  the {{StringContext}} [=identifier=], and
1.  the [=identifier=] of the operation or attribute.

The algorithm returns an ECMAScript String value, or [=ECMAScript/throws=] a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}}.

Note: The HTML Standard defines how the validation is performed. [[!HTML]]

## Integration with HTML ## {#integration-with-html}

{{Window}} objects have a <dfn for="Window">trusted type policy factory</dfn>,
which is a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} object.

Issue: Define for workers.

### Extensions to the Window interface ### {#extensions-to-the-window-interface}

This document extends the {{Window}} interface defined by [[HTML5|HTML]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin Window {
  [SecureContext] readonly attribute TrustedTypePolicyFactory trustedTypes;
};
</pre>

{{Window/trustedTypes}} returns the [[#integration-with-html|trusted
type policy factory]] of the current {{Window}}.

Note: The implementation in Chrome &lt; 78 uses `window.TrustedTypes` instead
      of `window.trustedTypes`.

Issue: Remove the note when the API in Chrome is shipped.

### Extensions to the Document interface ### {#extensions-to-the-document-interface}

This document modifies the {{Document}} interface defined by [[HTML5|HTML]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin Document {
  [CEReactions] void write(HTMLString... text);
  [CEReactions] void writeln(HTMLString... text);
};
</pre>

### Enforcement for scripts ### {#enfocement-in-scripts}

#### Slots with trusted values

Issue: Figure out if we can drop {{script/[[ScriptURL]]}} slot after IDL + DOM changes.

This document modifies {{script}} elements. Each script has:

: <dfn dfn-for="script">`[[ScriptURL]]`</dfn> internal slot.
::  A string, containing the URL to execute the script from
    that was set through a {{StringContext}} compliant sink. Equivalent to
    {{HTMLScriptElement/src}} attribute value. Initially null.

: <dfn dfn-for="script">`[[ScriptText]]`</dfn> internal slot.
::  A string, containing the body of the script to execute that was set
    through a {{StringContext}} compliant sink. Equivalent to script's
    [=child text content=]. Initially null.

#### Setting slot values

This document modifies how {{HTMLScriptElement}} [=child text content=] can be set to allow applications to control dynamically created scripts. It does so by
adding the {{HTMLElement/innerText}} and {{Node/textContent}} attributes directly on {{HTMLScriptElement}}. The behavior of the attributes remains the same
as in their original counterparts, apart from additional behavior triggered by the {{StringContext}} extended attribute presence.

Note: Using these IDL attributes is the recommended way of dynamically setting URL or a text of a script. Manipulating attribute nodes or text nodes directly will call a default policy on the final value when the script is prepared.

Issue: Figure out what to do with script.setAttribute('src'). See [DOM#789](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/789).

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin HTMLScriptElement : HTMLElement {
 [CEReactions] attribute [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] ScriptString innerText;
 [CEReactions] attribute ScriptString? textContent;
 [CEReactions] attribute ScriptURLString src;
 [CEReactions] attribute ScriptString text;
};
</pre>

On setting, the {{HTMLElement/innerText}}, {{Node/textContent}} and {{HTMLScriptElement/text}} IDL attributes perform the regular steps, and then set [=content object=]'s {{script/[[ScriptText]]}} internal slot value with the stringified value.

On setting, the {{HTMLScriptElement/src}} IDL attribute performs the usual steps, and then sets [=content object=]'s {{script/[[ScriptURL]]}} internal slot value to its {{script/src}} content attribute value.

#### Slot value verification

The [=prepare a script=] algorithm is modified as follows:

<ol><li>

### Enforcement in element attributes ### {#enforcement-in-sinks}

This document modifies following IDL attributes of various DOM elements:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin HTMLIFrameElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute HTMLString srcdoc;
};

partial interface HTMLEmbedElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute ScriptURLString src;
};

partial interface HTMLObjectElement : HTMLElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute ScriptURLString data;
  [CEReactions] attribute ScriptURLString codeBase; // obsolete
};
</pre>

Issue: Add base.href enforcement.

### Enforcement in timer functions ### {#enforcement-in-timer-functions}

This document modifies the {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope}} interface mixin:

<pre class="idl">
typedef (ScriptString or Function) TrustedTimerHandler;

partial interface mixin WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
  long setTimeout(TrustedTimerHandler handler, optional long timeout = 0, any... arguments);
  long setInterval(TrustedTimerHandler handler, optional long timeout = 0, any... arguments);
};
</pre>

To the [[HTML5#timer-initialisation-steps|timer initialization steps algorithm]],
add this step between 7.1 and 7.2:

1.  If the first operation argument is not a {{Function}}, or if the first operation argument is a {{TrustedType}}, set the first operation argument to the result of executing
    the [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with
    *   |global| set to the [=context object=]'s [=relevant global object=].
    *   |input| set to the first method argument, and
    *   |expectedType| set to {{TrustedScript}}.
    *   |sink| set to `Window.setInterval` if <var ignore>repeat</var> is true, `Window.setTimeout` otherwise.
    *   |sinkGroup| set to `'script'`.

        Note: This matches the logic that the extended attribute would apply.

Note: This makes sure that a {{TrustedScript}} is passed to timer
functions in place of a string when Trusted Types are enforced, but
also unconditionally accepts any {{Function}} object.

### Enforcement in event handler content attributes ### {#enforcement-in-event-handler-content-attributes}

This document modifies the
[=attribute change steps=] for an [[HTML5#event-handler-content-attributes|event handler content attribute]].

At the beginning of step 5, insert the following steps:

1.  Let |value| be the result of executing the
    [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with the following arguments:
    *   |value| as |input|,
    *   {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|,
    *   `'script'` as |sinkGroup|
    *   |sink| being the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; <var ignore>element</var>'s [=Element/local name=], |localName| &raquo; with `"."` as a |separator|.

        Note: For example, `document.createElement('div').onclick = value` will result in |sink| being `'div.onclick'`.

    *   <var ignore>eventTarget</var>'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|,

1.  If the algorithm throws an error, abort these steps.

Note: This also applies to events in [[SVG2#EventAttributes]].

<div class="example" id="event-handlers-example">
  <pre highlight=js>
  // Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'

  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.setAttribute('onerror', 'alert(1)'); // TypeError
  </pre>
</div>

### Validate the string in context ### {#html-validate-the-string-in-context}

This specification defines the <a>validate the string in context</a> algorithm in [[html#integration-with-idl]].

When <a>validate the string in context</a> is invoked, with |platformObject|, |value|, |stringContext|, and |identifier| run these steps:

 1. If [=platformObject=]'s [=relevant global object=] has a [=Window/trusted type policy factory=]:

    Issue: Update when workers have TT.

    1. Set |sink| to the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; |platformObject|'s <a spec=webidl>identifier</a>, |identifier| &raquo; with `" "` as |separator|.
        <div class="example" id="validate-string-example">
        For example, the following annotation and JavaScript code:
        <pre highlight=idl>
        typedef [StringContext=TrustedHTML] DOMString HTMLString;
        [ Exposed=Window, HTMLConstructor] interface HTMLIFrameElement : HTMLElement {
            attribute HTMLString srcdoc;
        };
        </pre>
        <pre highlight=js>
        document.createElement('iframe').srcdoc = foo;
        document.createElement('iframe').setAttribute('SRCdoc', foo);
        </pre>
        causes the |sink| value to be `"HTMLIFrameElement srcdoc"`.
        </div>
    1. Set |value| to the result of running the [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, passing the following arguments:
        * |value| as |input|,
        * |stringContext| as |expectedType|,
        * |sink| as |sink|,
        * `'script'` as |sinkGroup|,
        * |platformObject|'s [=relevant global object=] as |global|.

        Issue: Remove hardcoding 'script' when new sink groups are specified.

    1. If an exception was thrown, rethrow exception and abort further steps.
 1. Return |value|.

### Web Workers ###  {#html-workers}

This specification modifies the Worker constuctors and {{importScripts}} function to require {{ScriptURLString}}.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
partial interface Worker : EventTarget {
    constructor(ScriptURLString scriptURL, optional WorkerOptions options = {});
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
partial interface SharedWorker : EventTarget {
  constructor(ScriptURLString scriptURL, optional (DOMString or WorkerOptions) options = {});
};

[Exposed=Worker]
partial interface WorkerGlobalScope : EventTarget {
  void importScripts(ScriptURLString... urls);
};
</pre>

## Integration with Service Workers ## {#sw-integration}

This document modifies the IDL for registering service workers, requiring {{ScriptURLString}}:

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
partial interface ServiceWorkerContainer : EventTarget {
   [NewObject] Promise&lt;ServiceWorkerRegistration> register(ScriptURLString scriptURL, optional RegistrationOptions options = {});
};
</pre>

## Integration with SVG ## {#integration-with-svg}

This document modifies the {{SVGScriptElement}} interface to enforce Trusted Types:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin SVGScriptElement : SVGElement {
 // overwrites the definition in SVGURIReference.
 readonly attribute ScriptURLString href;
};
</pre>

Issue: Check the text of the script when preparing it, like with HTML scripts.

## Integration with DOM ## {#integration-with-dom}

This document modifies the {{Element}} interface, adding <a>attribute validation steps</a>:

<p><ins>This and <a lt="other applicable specifications">other specifications</a> may define
<dfn export id=concept-element-attributes-validation-ext>attribute validation steps</dfn> for
<a for=/>elements</a>. The algorithm is passed <var>element</var>, <var>localName</var>,
<var>value</var>, and <var>namespace</var>.</ins>

This document changes the  <a>handle attribute changes</a> algorithm, adding the following step at the beginning:
<ol>
 <li><ins><p>Run the <a>attribute validation steps</a> with <var>element</var>,
 <var>attribute</var>'s <a for=Attr>local name</a>, <var>newValue</var> and
 <var>attribute</var>'s <a for=Attr>namespace</a>. If this throws an exception, then
 rethrow the exception and abort further steps.</ins>
</ol>

Additionally, this document changes the <a spec=dom>append</a> an attribute algorithm:

<p>To <dfn export id=concept-element-attributes-append lt="append an attribute">append</dfn> an
<a>attribute</a> <var>attribute</var> to an <a for="/">element</a> <var>element</var>
<ins>with a <var>value</var></ins>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p><a>Handle attribute changes</a> for <var>attribute</var> with <var>element</var>, null, and
 <del><var>attribute</var>'s <a for=Attr>value</a></del><ins><var>value</var></ins>.

 <li><ins><p>Set <var>attribute</var>'s <a for=Attr>value</a> to <var>value</var>.</ins>

 <li><p><a for=list>Append</a> <var>attribute</var> to <var>element</var>'s
 <a for=Element>attribute list</a>.
 <li><p>Set <var>attribute</var>'s <a for=Attr>element</a> to <var>element</var>.
</ol>

Callers of this algorithm are changed accordingly.

Issue: Remove when <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/809">DOM #809</a> is merged.


## Integration with DOM Parsing ## {#integration-with-dom-parsing}

This document modifies the following interfaces defined by [[DOM-Parsing]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface Element {
  [CEReactions, TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute HTMLString outerHTML;
  [CEReactions] void insertAdjacentHTML(DOMString position, HTMLString text);
};

partial interface mixin InnerHTML { // specified in a draft version at https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#the-innerhtml-mixin
  [CEReactions, TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute HTMLString innerHTML;
};

partial interface Range {
  [CEReactions, NewObject] DocumentFragment createContextualFragment(HTMLString fragment);
};

[Constructor, Exposed=Window]
interface DOMParser {
  [NewObject] Document parseFromString(HTMLString str, SupportedType type);
};
</pre>

## Integration with Content Security Policy ## {#integration-with-content-security-policy}

### <dfn lt="require-trusted-types-for-directive">require-trusted-types-for</dfn> directive ### {#require-trusted-types-for-csp-directive}

This document defines *require-trusted-types-for* - a new [=directive|Content Security Policy directive=].

{{#require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for}} directive configures the Trusted
Types framework for all the [=injection sinks=] of certain groups in a current [=Realm|realm=].
Specifically, it defines what should be the behavior when a string value is passed to an [=injection sink=]
of a given group (i.e. should the type-based enforcement be enabled for such sinks).

Note: Currently, only the enforcement for [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]] is specified.

The syntax for the directive's [=directive/name=] and [=directive/value=] is described by the following
ABNF:

<pre>
directive-name = "require-trusted-types-for"
directive-value = <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> *( <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#grammardef-required-ascii-whitespace">required-ascii-whitespace</a> <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a>)
<dfn>trusted-types-sink-group</dfn> = "'script'"
</pre>

<div class="example" id="require-tt-for-script-header">
Enforce Trusted Types at the DOM XSS injection sinks.

<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'
</pre>
</div>

#### `require-trusted-types-for` Pre-Navigation check #### {#require-trusted-types-for-pre-navigation-check}

Given a [=request=] (|request|), a string |navigation type| and a [=CSP3#content-security-policy-object|policy=] (|policy|), this algorithm returns `"Blocked"`
if a navigation violates the {{#require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for}} directive's constraints and `"Allowed"`
otherwise. This constitutes the {{#require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for}} directive's [=pre-navigation check=]:

Note: This algorithm assures that the code to be executed by a navigation to a `javascript:` URL will have to pass through a
<a>default policy</a>'s `createScript` function, in addition to all other restrictions imposed by other CSP directives.

1. If |request|'s [=request/client=] is not a [=secure context=], return `"Allowed"` and abort further steps.

    Note: `require-trusted-types-for` directive is recognized only for secure contexts.
1. If |request|'s [=request/url=]'s [=url/scheme=] is not `"javascript"`, return `"Allowed"` and abort further steps.
1. Let |urlString| be the result of running the [=URL serializer=] on |request|'s [=request/url=].
1. Let |encodedScriptSource| be the result of removing the leading `"javascript:"` from |urlString|.
1. Let |convertedScriptSource| be the result of executing [$Process value with a default policy$] algorithm, with the following arguments:

    * {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|
    * |request|'s [=request/clients=]'s [=environment settings object/global object=] as |global|
    * |encodedScriptSource| as |input|
    * `"Location.href"` as |sink|

    If that algorithm threw an error or |convertedScriptSource| is not a {{TrustedScript}} object, return "Blocked" and abort further steps.
1. Set |urlString| to be the result of prepending `"javascript:"` to stringified |convertedScriptSource|.
1. Let |newURL| be the result of running the [=URL parser=] on |urlString|. If the parser returns a failure, return `"Blocked"` and abort further steps.
1. Set |request|'s [=request/url=] to |newURL|.

     Note: No other CSP directives operate on `javascript:` URLs in a pre-navigation check. Other directives that check javascript: URLs
           will operate on the modified URL later, in the [=inline check=].
1. Return `"Allowed"`.


### <dfn lt="trusted-types-directive">trusted-types</dfn> directive ### {#trusted-types-csp-directive}

This document defines *trusted-types* - a new [=directive|Content Security Policy directive=]. The {{#trusted-types-directive|trusted-types}} directive controls the creation of Trusted Type [=policies=].

The syntax for the directive's [=directive/name=] and [=directive/value=] is described by the following
ABNF:

<pre>
directive-name = "trusted-types"

### <dfn abstract-op>Should sink type mismatch violation be blocked by Content Security Policy?</dfn> ### {#should-block-sink-type-mismatch}

Given a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|sink|), a string (|sinkGroup|) and a string (|source|) this algorithm

### <dfn abstract-op>Should Trusted Type policy creation be blocked by Content Security Policy?</dfn> ### {#should-block-create-policy}

Given a [=Realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|policyName|) and a list of

### Support for eval(TrustedScript) ### {#csp-eval}

This document modifies the [[CSP3#can-compile-strings|EnsureCSPDoesNotBlockStringCompilation]]
which is reproduced in its entirety below with additions and deletions.

Note: See <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/938">TC39/ecma262 issue #938</a>
(adding the value to be compiled to algorithm parameters).

<div class="note">Note: EcmaScript code may call `Function()` and `eval` cross realm.
<pre highlight="js">
  let f = new self.top.Function(source);
</pre>
In this case, the |callerRealm|'s Window is `self` and the |calleeRealm|'s Window is `self.top`.
The Trusted Types portion of this algorithm uses |calleeRealm| for consistency with other sinks.
<pre highlight="js">
  // Assigning a string to another Realm's DOM sink uses that Realm's default policy.
  self.top.body.innerHTML = 'Hello, World!';
  // Using another Realm's builtin Function constructor should analogously use that
  // Realm's default policy.
  new self.top.Function('alert(1)')()
</pre>
This is subtly different from the CSP directive enforcement portion which rejects if either
the |calleeRealm| or |callerRealm|'s Content-Security-Policy rejects string compilation.
</div>

Given two [[ECMASCRIPT#realm|realms]] (|callerRealm| and
|calleeRealm|), and a <del>string</del> <ins>value</ins>
(|source|), this algorithm returns <del>normally</del>
<ins>the source string to compile</ins> if compilation is allowed, and
throws an "`EvalError`" if not:

1.  <ins>Let |sourceString| be the result of executing the
    [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] algorithm, with:
    *   |calleeRealm| as |global|,
    *   |source| as |input|,
    *   `eval` as |sink|,
    *   `'script'` as |sinkGroup|,
    *   {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|.</ins>

2.  <ins>If the algorithm throws an error, throw an {{EvalError}}.</ins>

3.  Let |globals| be a list containing |calleeRealm|'s [=Realm/global object=] and |calleeRealm|'s
    [=Realm/global object=].

4.  For each |global| in |globals|:

    1.  Let |result| be "`Allowed`".

    2.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a for="global object" spec="CSP3">CSP list</a>:

        1.  Let |source-list| be `null`.

        2.  If |policy| contains a [=directive=] whose [=directive/name=] is "`script-src`", then
            set |source-list| to that [=directive=]'s [=directive/value=].

            Otherwise if |policy| contains a [=directive=] whose [=directive/name=] is
            "`default-src`", then set |source-list| to that directive's [=directive/value=].

        3.  If |source-list| is not `null`, and does not contain a [=source expression=] which is
            an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string "<a grammar>`'unsafe-eval'`</a>" then:

            1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing [[CSP3#create-violation-for-global]] on
                |global|, |policy|, and "`script-src`".

            2.  Set |violation|'s [=violation/resource=] to "`inline`".

            3.  If |source-list| [=list/contains=] the expression
                "<a grammar>`'report-sample'`</a>", then set |violation|'s [=violation/sample=] to
                the substring of <del>|source|</del> <ins>|sourceString|</ins> containing its first
                40 characters.

            4.  Execute [[CSP3#report-violation]] on |violation|.

            5.  If |policy|'s [=policy/disposition=] is "`enforce`", then set |result| to
                "`Blocked`".

    3.  If |result| is "`Blocked`", throw an `EvalError` exception.

6. <ins>Return |sourceString|.</ins>

Note: returning |sourceString| means that the string that gets
compiled is that returned by any [=default policy=] in the course of
executing [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$].

Issue: This depends on a solution to
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types/issues/144">issue #144</a> like <a
href="https://github.com/tc39-transfer/dynamic-code-brand-checks#problem-host-callout-does-not-receive-type-information">TC39 HostBeforeCompile</a>

Issue: In some cases, the violation "`'report-sample'`" contain the result of
applying the default policy to a string argument which differs.
Specifically when, there is a [=default policy=], |isExempt| is false,
and |source| there is a CSP policy for either the |callerRealm|
or |callerRealm| that disallows "`'unsafe-eval'"`.
Is this a feature or a bug?

Note: The previous algorithm reports violations via both report-uris where
callerRealm != calleeRealm.  If [$Get Trusted Type compliant string$] reports an
error, it only reports it via its |calleeRealm|'s report-uri.

# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

Trusted Types are not intended to protect access to [=injection sinks=] in an
actively malicious execution environment. It's assumed that the application is
written by non-malicious authors; the intent is to prevent developer mistakes
that could result in security bugs, and not to defend against first-party
malicious code actively trying to bypass policy restrictions. Below we enumerate
already identified vectors that remain risky even in environments with enforced
Trusted Types.

## Cross-document vectors ## {#cross-document-vectors}

While the code running in a window in which Trusted Types are enforced cannot
dynamically create nodes that would bypass the policy restrictions, it is
possible that such nodes can be imported or adopted from documents in other
windows, that don't have the same set of restrictions. In essence - it is
possible to bypass Trusted Types if a malicious author creates a setup in which
a restricted document colludes with an unrestricted one.

CSP propagation rules (see [[CSP3#initialize-document-csp]] partially address this
issue, as new [=local scheme=] documents will inherit the same set of restrictions.
To address this issue comprehensively, other mechanisms like
<a href="https://wicg.github.io/origin-policy/">Origin Policy</a>
should be used to ensure that baseline security rules are applied for the whole
origin.

## Deprecated features ## {#deprecated-features}

Some long-deprecated and rarely used plaform features are not subject to Trusted
Types, and could potentially be used by malicious authors to overcome the
restrictions:

* <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/">HTML imports</a>

## Plugin navigation ## {#plugins}

Plugin content may have access to the document that embeds it (or; more broadly,
to the origin it was served from), often giving it the same capabilities
as DOM XSS. That's why Trusted Types limit {{HTMLObjectElement.src}} to
{{TrustedScriptURL}}.

However, it is also possible to navigate an existing object / embed to an
arbitrary location, bypassing the {{TrustedScriptURL}} restriction.

Since plugin content in the web in general is being phased out for other
security reasons, and their navigation model is in flux, we recommend authors
to prevent that bypass vector by limiting the plugins altogether with
[=object-src=]. For example: `Content-Security-Policy: object-src: none`.

## Best practices for policy design ## {#best-practices-for-policy-design}

Trusted Types limit the scope of the code that can introduce
vulnerabilities via [=injection sinks=] to the implementation of [=policies=].
In this design, insecure policies can still expose [=injection sinks=] to untrusted data.
Special emphasis needs to be taken by use policies that are either secure for all
possible inputs, or limit the access to insecure policies, such that they are only
called with non-attacker controlled inputs.

As policies are custom JavaScript code, they may be written in a way that heavily
depends on a global state. We advise against this. The policies should
be self-contained as much as possible. All objects that may alter security decisions
a policy makes effectively *become* the policy, and should be guarded & reviewed
together.

Issue: Refer to the external document on secure policy design.

# Implementation Considerations # {#implementation-considerations}

## Vendor-specific Extensions and Addons ## {#vendor-specific-extensions-and-addons}

Restriction imposed by Trusted Types SHOULD
NOT interfere with the operation of user-agent features like addons,
extensions, or bookmarklets. These kinds of features generally advance
the user’s priority over page authors, as espoused in
[[html-design-principles]]. Specifically, extensions SHOULD be able to pass strings
to the [=injection sinks=] without triggering [=default policy=]
execution, violation generation, or the rejection of the value.
