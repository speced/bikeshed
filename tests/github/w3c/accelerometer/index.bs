Introduction {#intro}
============

The {{Accelerometer}}, {{LinearAccelerationSensor}} and {{GravitySensor}} APIs extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
interface to provide information about [=acceleration=] applied to device's
X, Y and Z axis in [=local coordinate system=] defined by device.

Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new Accelerometer();
    sensor.start();

    sensor.onreading = () => {
        console.log("Acceleration along X-axis: " + sensor.x);
        console.log("Acceleration along Y-axis: " + sensor.y);
        console.log("Acceleration along Z-axis: " + sensor.z);
    }

    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    </pre>
</div>

Use Cases and Requirements {#usecases-requirements}
==============================

The use cases and requirements are listed in the <cite><a href="https://w3c.github.io/motion-sensors/#usecases-and-requirements">
Motion Sensors Explainer</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/usecases.html">
Sensor use cases</a></cite> documents.

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

There are no specific security and privacy considerations
beyond those described in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The <dfn id="accelerometer-sensor-type">Accelerometer</dfn> <a>sensor type</a>'s associated {{Sensor}} subclass is the {{Accelerometer}} class.

The <a>Accelerometer</a> has a [=default sensor=], which is the device's main accelerometer sensor.

The <a>Accelerometer</a> has an associated {{PermissionName}} which is <a for="PermissionName" enum-value>"accelerometer"</a>.

A [=latest reading=] for a {{Sensor}} of <a>Accelerometer</a> <a>sensor type</a> includes three [=map/entries=]
whose [=map/keys=] are "x", "y", "z" and whose [=map/values=] contain device's [=acceleration=]
about the corresponding axes. Values can contain also device's [=linear acceleration=] or [=gravity=]
depending on which object was instantiated.

The <dfn>acceleration</dfn> is the rate of change of velocity of a device with respect to time. Its 
unit is the metre per second squared (m/s<sup>2</sup>) [[SI]].

The frame of reference for the [=acceleration=] measurement must be inertial, such as, the device in free fall would
provide 0 (m/s<sup>2</sup>) [=acceleration=] value for each axis.

The sign of the [=acceleration=] values must be according to the right-hand convention in a [=local coordinate
system=] defined by the device.

The {{LinearAccelerationSensor}} class is an {{Accelerometer}}'s subclass. The {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}'s
[=latest reading=] contains device's [=linear acceleration=] about the corresponding axes.

The <dfn>linear acceleration</dfn> is an [=acceleration=] that is applied to the device that hosts
the sensor, without the contribution of a [=gravity=] force.

The {{GravitySensor}} class is an {{Accelerometer}}'s subclass. The {{GravitySensor}}'s
[=latest reading=] contains device's [=acceleration=] due to the effect of [=gravity=] force about the corresponding axes.

The <dfn>gravity</dfn> is a force that attracts an object to the center of the earth, or towards any other physical object having mass.

Note: The <dfn>local coordinate system</dfn> of a mobile device is usually defined relative to
the device's screen when the device in its default orientation (see figure below).

API {#api}

The Accelerometer Interface {#accelerometer-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions options), SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
  interface Accelerometer : Sensor {
    readonly attribute double? x;
    readonly attribute double? y;
    readonly attribute double? z;
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct an Accelerometer Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke
the [=construct a Sensor object=] abstract operation.

### Accelerometer.x ### {#accelerometer-x}

The {{Accelerometer/x!!attribute}} attribute of the {{Accelerometer}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "x" as arguments. It represents the [=acceleration=] along x-axis.

### Accelerometer.y ### {#accelerometer-y}

The {{Accelerometer/y!!attribute}} attribute of the {{Accelerometer}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "y" as arguments. It represents the [=acceleration=] along y-axis.

### Accelerometer.z ### {#accelerometer-z}

The {{Accelerometer/z!!attribute}} attribute of the {{Accelerometer}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "z" as arguments. It represents the [=acceleration=] along z-axis.

The LinearAccelerationSensor Interface {#linearaccelerationsensor-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions options), SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
  interface LinearAccelerationSensor : Accelerometer {
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct a LinearAccelerationSensor Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke
the [=construct a Sensor object=] abstract operation.

### LinearAccelerationSensor.x ### {#linearaccelerationsensor-x}

The {{Accelerometer/x!!attribute}} attribute of the {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "x" as arguments. It represents the [=linear acceleration=] along x-axis.

### LinearAccelerationSensor.y ### {#linearaccelerationsensor-y}

The {{Accelerometer/y!!attribute}} attribute of the {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "y" as arguments. It represents the [=linear acceleration=] along y-axis.

### LinearAccelerationSensor.z ### {#linearaccelerationsensor-z}

The {{Accelerometer/z!!attribute}} attribute of the {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "z" as arguments. It represents the [=linear acceleration=] along z-axis.

The GravitySensor Interface {#gravitysensor-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions options), SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
  interface GravitySensor : Accelerometer {
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct an GravitySensor Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke
the [=construct a Sensor object=] abstract operation.

### GravitySensor.x ### {#gravitysensor-x}

The {{Accelerometer/x!!attribute}} attribute of the {{GravitySensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "x" as arguments. It represents the effect of [=acceleration=] along x-axis due to
[=gravity=].

### GravitySensor.y ### {#gravitysensor-y}

The {{Accelerometer/y!!attribute}} attribute of the {{GravitySensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "y" as arguments. It represents the effect of [=acceleration=] along y-axis due to
[=gravity=].

The {{Accelerometer/z!!attribute}} attribute of the {{GravitySensor}}
interface returns the result of invoking [=get value from latest reading=] with
`this` and "z" as arguments. It represents the effect of [=acceleration=] along z-axis due to
[=gravity=].

Conformance {#conformance}
===========

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
"MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]

A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> must implement all the requirements
listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.

The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for
conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
