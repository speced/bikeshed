Introduction {#intro}
============

The {{Accelerometer}}, {{LinearAccelerationSensor}} and {{GravitySensor}} APIs extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
interface to provide information about [=acceleration=] applied to device's
X, Y and Z axis in [=local coordinate system=] defined by device.

Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new Accelerometer();
    sensor.start();

    sensor.onreading = () => {
        console.log("Acceleration along X-axis: " + sensor.x);
        console.log("Acceleration along Y-axis: " + sensor.y);
        console.log("Acceleration along Z-axis: " + sensor.z);
    }

    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
    The following example shows how to use gravity sensor that provides
    readings in the [=screen coordinate system=]. The snippet will print message to the
    console when the [=dom screen=] is perpendicular to the ground and bottom of the
    rendered web page is pointing downwards.
    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new GravitySensor({frequency: 5, referenceFrame: "screen"});

    sensor.onreading = () => {
      if (sensor.y >= 9.8) {
        console.log("Web page is perpendicular to the ground.");
      }
    }

    sensor.start();
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
    The following example detects shake gesture along x axis of the device, regardless
    of the orientation of the [=dom screen=].
    <pre highlight="js">
    const shakeThreshold = 25;

    let sensor = new LinearAccelerationSensor({frequency: 60});

    sensor.addEventListener('reading', () => {
      if (sensor.x > shakeThreshold) {
        console.log("Shake detected.");
      }
    });

    sensor.start();
    </pre>
</div>

Use Cases and Requirements {#usecases-requirements}
==============================

The use cases and requirements are listed in the <cite><a href="https://w3c.github.io/motion-sensors/#usecases-and-requirements">
Motion Sensors Explainer</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/usecases.html">
Sensor use cases</a></cite> documents.

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

[=Sensor readings=] provided by inertial sensors, such as accelerometer, could be used by adversaries
to exploit various security threats, for example, [=keylogging=], [=location tracking=],
[=fingerprinting=] and [=user identifying=].

Research papers published by security community, for instance, [[KEYSTROKEDEFENSE]], indicate that
by throttling the frequency, risks of successful attacks are not fully eliminated, while throttling
may greatly affect usefulness of a web application with legitimate reasons to use the sensors.

The [[TOUCHSIGNATURES]] and [[ACCESSORY]] research papers propose that implementations can
provide visual indication when inertial sensors are in use and/or require explicit user consent to
access [=sensor readings=]. These mitigation strategies complement the [=generic mitigations=] defined
in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The <dfn id="accelerometer-sensor-type">Accelerometer</dfn> <a>sensor type</a>'s associated {{Sensor}} subclass is the {{Accelerometer}} class.

The <a>Accelerometer</a> has a [=default sensor=], which is the device's main accelerometer sensor.

The <a>Accelerometer</a> has an associated [=sensor permission name=] which is <a for="PermissionName" enum-value>"accelerometer"</a>.

A [=latest reading=] for a {{Sensor}} of <a>Accelerometer</a> <a>sensor type</a> includes three [=map/entries=]
whose [=map/keys=] are "x", "y", "z" and whose [=map/values=] contain device's [=acceleration=]
about the corresponding axes. Values can contain also device's [=linear acceleration=] or [=gravity=]
depending on which object was instantiated.

The <dfn>acceleration</dfn> is the rate of change of velocity of a device with respect to time. Its 
unit is the metre per second squared (m/s<sup>2</sup>) [[SI]].

The frame of reference for the [=acceleration=] measurement must be inertial, such as, the device in free fall would
provide 0 (m/s<sup>2</sup>) [=acceleration=] value for each axis.

The sign of the [=acceleration=] values must be according to the right-hand convention in a [=local coordinate
system=] (see figure below).

<img src="images/accelerometer_coordinate_system.svg" onerror="this.src='images/accelerometer_coordinate_system.png'" style="display: block;margin: auto;" alt="Accelerometer coordinate system.">

The {{LinearAccelerationSensor}} class is an {{Accelerometer}}'s subclass. The {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}'s
[=latest reading=] contains device's [=linear acceleration=] about the corresponding axes.

The <dfn>linear acceleration</dfn> is an [=acceleration=] that is applied to the device that hosts
the sensor, without the contribution of a [=gravity=] force.

The {{GravitySensor}} class is an {{Accelerometer}}'s subclass. The {{GravitySensor}}'s
[=latest reading=] contains device's [=acceleration=] due to the effect of [=gravity=] force about the corresponding axes.

The <dfn>gravity</dfn> is a force that attracts an object to the center of the earth, or towards any other physical object having mass.

Reference Frame {#reference-frame}
----------------

The [=local coordinate system=] represents the reference frame for the
{{Accelerometer}}, {{LinearAccelerationSensor}}, and the {{GravitySensor}}
[=sensor readings|readings=]. It can be either the [=device coordinate system=]
or the [=screen coordinate system=].

The <dfn export>device coordinate system</dfn> is defined as a three dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), which is bound to the physical device.
For devices with a display, the origin of the [=device coordinate system=] is
the center of the device display. If the device is held in its default position,
the Y-axis points towards the top of the display, the X-axis points towards the right of
the display and Z-axis is the vector product of X and Y axes and it points outwards from
the display, and towards the viewer. The [=device coordinate system=] remains stationary
regardless of the [=dom screen=] orientation (see figure below).

<img src="images/device_coordinate_system.svg" onerror="this.src='images/device_coordinate_system.png'" style="display: block;margin: auto;" alt="Device coordinate system.">

The <dfn export>screen coordinate system</dfn> is defined as a three dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), which is bound to the [=dom screen=].
The origin of the [=screen coordinate system=] in the center
of the [=dom screen=]. The Y-axis always points towards the top of the [=dom screen=],
the X-axis points towards the right of the [=dom screen=] and Z-axis is the
vector product of X and Y axes and it and it points outwards from the [=dom screen=],
and towards the viewer (see figure below).

<img src="images/screen_coordinate_system.svg" onerror="this.src='images/screen_coordinate_system.png'" style="display: block;margin: auto;" alt="Screen coordinate system.">

The main difference between the [=device coordinate system=] and the [=screen coordinate system=],
is that the [=screen coordinate system=] always follows the [=dom screen=] orientation,
i.e. it will swap X and Y axes in relation to the device if the [=current orientation type=]
changes. In contrast, the [=device coordinate system=] will always remain stationary relative to
the device.
