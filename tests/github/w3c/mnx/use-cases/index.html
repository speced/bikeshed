 *                   Style sheet for the W3C specifications                   *
 *
 * Special classes handled by this style sheet include:
 *
 * Indices
 *   - .toc for the Table of Contents (<ol class="toc">)
 *     + <span class="secno"> for the section numbers
 *   - #toc for the Table of Contents (<nav id="toc">)
 *   - ul.index for Indices (<a href="#ref">term</a><span>, in Â§N.M</span>)
 *   - table.index for Index Tables (e.g. for properties or elements)
 *
 * Structural Markup
 *   - table.data for general data tables
 *     -> use 'scope' attribute, <colgroup>, <thead>, and <tbody> for best results !
 *     -> use <table class='complex data'> for extra-complex tables
 *     -> use <td class='long'> for paragraph-length cell content
 *     -> use <td class='pre'> when manual line breaks/indentation would help readability
 *   - dl.switch for switch statements
 *   - ol.algorithm for algorithms (helps to visualize nesting)
 *   - .figure and .caption (HTML4) and figure and figcaption (HTML5)
 *     -> .sidefigure for right-floated figures
 *   - ins/del
 *
 * Code
 *   - pre and code
 *
 * Special Sections
 *   - .note       for informative notes             (div, p, span, aside, details)
 *   - .example    for informative examples          (div, p, pre, span)
 *   - .issue      for issues                        (div, p, span)
 *   - .assertion  for assertions                    (div, p, span)
 *   - .advisement for loud normative statements     (div, p, strong)
 *   - .annoying-warning for spec obsoletion notices (div, aside, details)
 *
 * Definition Boxes
 *   - pre.def   for WebIDL definitions
 *   - table.def for tables that define other entities (e.g. CSS properties)
 *   - dl.def    for definition lists that define other entitles (e.g. HTML elements)
 *
 * Numbering
 *   - .secno for section numbers in .toc and headings (<span class='secno'>3.2</span>)
 *   - .marker for source-inserted example/figure/issue numbers (<span class='marker'>Issue 4</span>)
 *   - ::before styled for CSS-generated issue/example/figure numbers:
 *     -> Documents wishing to use this only need to add
 *        figcaption::before,
 *        .caption::before { content: "Figure "  counter(figure) " ";  }
 *        .example::before { content: "Example " counter(example) " "; }
 *        .issue::before   { content: "Issue "   counter(issue) " ";   }
 *
 * Header Stuff (ignore, just don't conflict with these classes)
 *   - .head for the header
 *   - .copyright for the copyright
 *
 * Miscellaneous
 *   - .overlarge for things that should be as wide as possible, even if
 *     that overflows the body text area. This can be used on an item or
 *     on its container, depending on the effect desired.
 *     Note that this styling basically doesn't help at all when printing,
 *     since A4 paper isn't much wider than the max-width here.
 *     It's better to design things to fit into a narrower measure if possible.
 *   - js-added ToC jump links (see fixup.js)

   <p>This document describes a set of use cases for the Music Notation Community Group. It intentionally refrains from talking about the substance of any specification and is focused purely on scenarios concerning users and content. In effect, these cases are a lens to help us focus on where existing specifications should change, and to identify ideas from other standards efforts that can be applied.</p>
   <p>The inclusion of a use case here does not mean it is considered to be in scope.</p>

   <p>These are musical roles assumed by someone using music notation.</p>
   <p>The following roles are not clearly defined yet, but can help us begin collecting use cases based on an intuitive understanding of the terms. They are roles, not distinct people: a single person can occupy multiple roles in the same use case.</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Composer (C)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Arranger/Orchestrator (A)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Performer (PF)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Publisher (PU)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Editor (ED)</p>
    <li data-md="">

    <li data-md="">
     <p>Musicologist (M)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Student (S)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Instructor or Teacher (T)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Developer (D)</p>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Sound Engineer (SE)</p>
   </ul>
   <p>In the use cases below, users playing roles are typically represented by short capitalized abbreviations as shown above, sometimes followed by a distinguishing number.</p>
   <p>A lesson from other media types is, as the media moves from paper publishing to electronic publishing, people can starting taking on roles they would before have left to a specialist, people can take on more and more roles, and publishing can be done on a smaller scale and with smaller, more frequent cycles than before. For example, in a printed magazine itâs likely that there would be a clear distinction between the roles of Writer (think composer), Editor, Engraver, and Publisher. The Writer is not concerned with appearance and font choice. The Editor and Engraver are specialists, and different people than the writer. The Publisher has a large role, because the cost of publishing is high. In contrast, with a blog, the same person will choose the words (Writer), review the words (Editor), choose the appearance and fonts (Engraver), and decide to publish (a trivial vestige of the Publisher role). We should expect the same transformation of workflow, and merging of roles, in music notation, as it becomes digital and on-line.</p>

    C is composing a work and wishes to produce a digital document representing the contents of that work. The semantic content of the document is paramount as it represents Câs musical creation. Depending on Câs orientation, the nature of the work, the intentions regards publishing and performance, and the nature of the tool being used to do the encoding, visual and performance facets of the document may also be significant.

    C1 is co-composing a work with C2, with the locus of editing switching back and forth between them. C1 and C2 are not using the same notation application. Preservation of semantic, visual and performance data are all important in this case, and the less faithful the transfer, the more work must be done by hand by each party to recover or adjust information that is lost or corrupted. 
   <p>C1 is working on a compositional sketch that will subsequently be orchestrated by C2. C2 is not using the same notation application as C1, but C2 would like to begin C2âs work by modifying C1âs score as a starting point to ensure that there are no copying errors. In this case, the preservation of semantic and performance data is primary, while visual details may not matter as much.</p>

    C may be using a notation application that has become obsolete and wants to begin using a new application. Alternatively, C is concerned that Câs notation application may cease to be supported on modern computer hardware and operating systems, preventing C from revising Câs work. C would then either need to re-enter the music in another program, or keep an old hardware / software setup around to run the old program. C wants to archive Câs music in a format that maintains as much of the semantic, visual, and performance data that was captured in the original application as possible. Then C always has the option to transfer the music to a new program that can read the archival format. C wants to minimize the amount of rework needed, but an absolutely perfect transfer is not necessary. C doesnât want to lose the visual information for the portions of the music that wonât change, and doesnât want to lose the playback information that will help C when making revisions. 
   <p>To be useful, the transfers will need a high level of accuracy and completeness. Furthermore, C needs assurance that the archival format has enough stability and longevity to be readable in the future.</p>

    PF has custody of a printed edition of some music, and no access to any digital encoding of the work. PF would like to work with the music in a notation application to adapt it to their purposes, perhaps transposing to a more playable key. OMR software is usually developed independently of notation software, so PFâs OMR tools produce an intermediate digital format that can be imported into multiple notation applications. This format should preserve as much as possible of what the OMR software could discover, including both semantic and visual data from the original document.

    ED receives two different digital sheet music documents which purport to be the same score, maybe from two different proofreaders. ED runs comparison software on the two documents. Comparison can include or ignore differences in layout (focussing only on unrolled note sequence), in key signature (focussing only on pitches no matter how notated), in per-staff and score-wide annotations, in performance annotations, etc. In any case, implementation details like differences in insignificant whitespace in the music notation, are ignored. Comparison software returns a concise statement that the documents are identical, or a concise statement of what are the differences (show the content of 2 measures added to all parts after a certain measure, or the contents of a new staff throughout the piece in one document but not the other).

    D is building a music theory quiz in which questions are displayed along with an interactive musical excerpt. A student S must indicate one of several elements in a score as a response to the question. The music can be displayed and reflowed in a device-dependent fashion, so it will not suffice to look for gestures that occur in some specific region of the screen or page.

    D is building an music appreciation application for students S that includes various audio and notation excerpts. As the music plays, various relevant portions in the notation are highlighted. Links within accompanying text also serve to highlight the musical passages or concepts within the score to which they refer.

     <p>C creates a sequencer project that captures Câs music in purely performative/gestural terms. For live performance, C desires to communicate some or all of this music to performers that will produce the corresponding parts on physical instruments by reading conventional music notation. It may be desirable to preserve this information wholly or in part across a conversion process that yields a notational model, but we might also consider approaches that link or correlate gestural documents with visual/semantic ones instead of trying to blend this information. (How is digital encoding of notation involved in this story? At what point does the orchestrator ever need to work with a digital encoding of the notation, as opposed to an encoding of the sequencer data?)</p>
