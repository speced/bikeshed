<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  Most user agents have their own mechanisms to block autoplaying media, and those
  mechanisms are implementation-specific. Web developers need to have a way to
  detect if autoplaying media is allowed or not in order to make actions, such
  as selecting alternate content or improving the user experience while media
  is not allowed to autoplay. For instance, if a user agent only blocks audible
  autoplay, then web developers can replace audible media with inaudible media
  to keep media playing, instead of showing a blocked media which looks like a
  still image to users. If the user agent does not allow any autoplay media,
  then web developers could stop loading media resources and related tasks to
  save the bandwidth and CPU usage for users.

  Currently, this specification only handles {{HTMLMediaElement}} (<{video}>
  and <{audio}>) and [[webaudio inline]]. This specification does not handle
  [[speech-api inline]] and animated <{image}> (GIF animation).

<h2 id="autoplay-detection-api">The Autoplay Detection API</h2>
  Autoplay detection can be performed through the {{Navigator}} object. The
  result can either allow authors to know if media, which have the same type of
  the given media type and exist in the {{document}} contained in the
  {{Window}} object asscociated with the queried {{Navigator}} object, are
  allowed to autoplay, or to know if a specific element is allowed to autoplay.

              Note: Currently, this attribute will only be returned when the
              given media type or element is a type of {{HTMLMediaElement}}
              or its extensions, such as {{HTMLVideoElement}} or
              {{HTMLAudioElement}}.
            </div>
            An <dfn export>inaudible media element</dfn> is an {{HTMLMediaElement}}
            that has any of the following conditions:
            <ul>
              <li>media's {{HTMLMediaElement/volume}} equal to 0
              <li>media's {{HTMLMediaElement/muted}} is true
              <li>media's <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#media-resource">resource</a> does not have an audio track

          <td>
            No media is allowed to autoplay.
    </table>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      Note: The autoplay policy represents the current status of whether a
      user agent allows media to autoplay, which can **vary** in the future.
      Therefore, it is **recommended** that authors check the result every time
      if they want to have an up-to-date result.
    </div>

    <div class=example>
      If a user agent uses the user activation, described in
      [[HTML#user-activation-data-model]], to determine if the autoplay media
      are allowed or not, and the default policy is to block all autoplay
      ({{AutoplayPolicy/disallowed}}). Then the policy could change to
      {{AutoplayPolicy/allowed}} or {{AutoplayPolicy/allowed-muted}} after a
      user performs a supported user gesture on the page or the media.

        AutoplayPolicy getAutoplayPolicy(HTMLMediaElement element);

      };

            <td>
              It's used to query a status for {{AudioContext}}.
      </table>
    </div>

    <h4 id="query-by-a-media-type">Query by a Media Type</h4>
      The {{getAutoplayPolicy(type)}} methods return the **rough** status of
      whether media elements or audio context, which exist in the {{document}}
      contained in the {{Window}} object associated with the queried
      {{Navigator}} object, are allowed to autoplay or not. The rough status
      here means that the returned result isn't always correct for every
      elements which have the same type of the given media type.

      <div class="note">
        Note: Depending on the implementation, it's still possible for some
        media that exist on the same document would be allowed to autoplay when
        the result of querying by a media type is {{disallowed}}. In this
        situation, it is **recommended** that authors also query by a specific
        element in order to get an accurate result.
      </div>

      <div class=example>
        Some user agents may not allow any media element to autoplay by default,
        but allow autoplay on those media elements which have been clicked by
        users.

        For example, at first, the result of querying by a media type and
        querying by an object would both be {{disallowed}}. After a user clicks
        on a media element, then querying by that media element would become
        {{allowed}} if a user agent decides to bless that element because that
        behavior seems intended by users, but querying by a media type and
        querying by other media elements, which haven't been clicked yet, would
        still return {{disallowed}}.
      </div>

      When {{getAutoplayPolicy(type)}} method is called, the user agent MUST run
      the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If {{type}} is {{AutoplayPolicyMediaType/mediaelement}}, return a
          result that represents the current status for {{HTMLMediaElement}}
          and its extensions, such as {{HTMLVideoElement}} and
          {{HTMLAudioElement}}, which exist in the {{document}} contained in the
          {{Window}} object associated with the queried {{Navigator}} object.
        </li>
        <li>
          If {{type}} is {{AutoplayPolicyMediaType/audiocontext}}, return a
          result that represents the current status for {{AudioContext}},
          which exist in the {{document}} contained in the {{Window}} object
          associated with the queried {{Navigator}} object.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <dl class="switch">
      <dt>If the return value is {{allowed}}</dt>
      <dd>
        All media, corresponding with the given type, are allowed to autoplay.
      </dd>

      <dt>If the return value is {{allowed-muted}}</dt>
      <dd>
        All inaudible media, corresponding with the given type, are allowed to
        autoplay.
        <div class="note">
          Note: Currently, this attribute will only be returned when the given
          media type is {{AutoplayPolicyMediaType/mediaelement}}. The inaudible
          media means {{inaudible media element}}.
        </div>
      </dd>

      <dt>If the return value is {{disallowed}}</dt>
      <dd>
        **None** of media, corresponding with the given type, are allowed to
        autoplay.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="note">
      Note: Depending on the implementation, if a document has child
      documents, then the result queried from the {{Navigator}} object
      asscociated with the parent document could be different from the result
      queried from the {{Navigator}} object asscociated with the child
      documents.
    </div>

    <div class=example>
      Assume that the top level document A in `foo.com` returns {{allowed}} and
      it has an embedded iframe, which has another document B from `bar.com`. A
      user agent could either make child document B return same result that is
      inherited from the top level document A. Or make the document B return a
      different result, eg. {{disallowed}}.

      Doing the former helps to lower the complexity and make the behavior of
      blocking autoplay more consistent. The latter helps providing a
      finer-grained autoplay control.
    </div>

  <h4 id="query-by-a-element">Query by an Element</h3>
    The {{getAutoplayPolicy(element)}} and {{getAutoplayPolicy(context)}}
    methods return the current status of whether the given element is allowed
    to autoplay or not.

    <dl class="switch">
      <dt>If the return value is {{allowed}}</dt>
      <dd>
        This element is allowed to autoplay within the current execution
        context.
      </dd>

      <dt>If the return value is {{allowed-muted}}</dt>
      <dd>
        This element will only be allowed to autoplay if it's inaudible.

        <div class="note">
          Note: Currently, this attribute will only be returned when the given
          element is {{HTMLMediaElement}} or its extensions, such as
          {{HTMLVideoElement}} or {{HTMLAudioElement}}. The inaudible media
          means {{inaudible media element}}.

          In addition, if authors make an inaudible media element audible
          right after it starts playing, then it is **recommended** for a
          user agent to pause that media element immediately because it's no
          longer inaudible.
        </div>
      </dd>

      <dt>If the return value is {{disallowed}}</dt>
      <dd>
        This element is not allowed to autoplay.
        <div class="note">
          Note: For {{HTMLMediaElement}}, if authors call its
          {{HTMLMediaElement/play()}}, the returned promise from
          {{HTMLMediaElement/play()}} will be rejected with {{NotAllowedError}}
          exception.

          For {{AudioContext}}, that means its {{AudioContextState}} would keep
          in {{AudioContextState/suspended}} state.
        </div>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    If the result of querying by a media type is different from the result
    of querying by an element, authors should take the latter one as the correct
    result. Example 2 shows a possible scenario.

    <div class="note">
      Note: If the element which authors pass is not {{HTMLMediaElement}} (or
      its extension, such as {{HTMLVideoElement}} and {{HTMLAudioElement}}) or
      {{AudioContext}}, then these methods will throw a {{TypeError}}.

<h2 id="security-and-privacy">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
  Per the [[security-privacy-questionnaire#questions]].

  The API introduced in this specification has very low impact with regards to
  security and privacy. It does not expose any sensitive information that can be
  used to to identify users. It does not expose any ability to control sensors
  and any users' devices. It does not introduce any new state for an origin that
  will persist across browsing sessions. It does not allow an origin to send any
  data to the underlying platform. It does not introduce or enable new script
  execution and loading mechanism. It does not allow an origin to draw over a
  user agent's native UI. It does not allow an origin to detect if users are in
  the private or non-private browsing mode.
