  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  When a user successfully loads a webpage from <code>example.com</code> over a
  secure channel (HTTPS, for example), the user is guaranteed that no entity
  between the user agent and <code>example.com</code> eavesdropped on or
  tampered with the data transmitted between them. However, this guarantee is
  weakened if the webpage loads subresources such as script or images over an
  insecure connection. For example, an insecurely-loaded script can allow an
  attacker to read or modify data on behalf of the user. An insecurely-loaded
  image can allow an attacker to communicate incorrect information to the user
  (e.g., a fabricated stock chart), mutate client-side state (e.g., set a
  cookie), or induce the user to take an unintended action (e.g., changing the
  label on a button). These requests are known as mixed content.

  [[!mixed-content]] details how a user agent can mitigate these risks by
  blocking certain types of mixed content, and behaving more strictly in some
  contexts.

  However, as implemented in today's web browsers, [[!mixed-content]] does not fully protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of users' data. Insecure content such as images, audio, and video
  can currently be loaded by default in secure contexts. Secure pages can even initiate insecure
  downloads which escape the user agent's sandbox entirely.

  Moreover, users do not have a clear security indicator when mixed content is loaded. When a
  webpage loads mixed content, browsers display an "in-between" security indicator (such as removing
  the padlock icon), which does not give users a clear indication of whether they should trust the
  page. This UX has also not proved a sufficient incentive for developers to avoid mixed content,
  since it is still common for webpages to load mixed content. Blocking all mixed content would
  provide the user with a simpler mental model -- the webpage is either loaded over a secure
  transport or it isn't -- and encourage developers to securely load any mixed content that is
  necessary for their webpage to function properly.

  Mixed Content Level 2 therefore updates and extends [[!mixed-content]] to provide users with
  better security and privacy guarantees and a better security UX, while minimizing
  breakage. Instead of advising browsers to simply strictly block all mixed content, the core idea
  of Level 2 is <i>mixed content autoupgrading</i>. That is, mixed content that user agents are not
  already blocking should be autoupgraded to a secure transport. If the request cannot be
  autoupgraded, it will be blocked. Autoupgrading avoids loading insecure resources on secure
  webpages, while minimizing the amount of developer effort needed to avoid breakage.

  This specification (Level 2) only recommends autoupgrading types of mixed content subresources
  that are not currently blocked by default, and does not recommend autougprading types of content
  that are already blocked. This is to minimize the amount of web-visible change; we only want to
  autoupgrade content if it advances us towards the goal of blocking all mixed content by default.

  This specification also explicitly introduces the concept of <i>mixed downloads</i>. A mixed
  download is a resource that a user agent handles as a download, which was initiated by a secure
  context but is downloaded over an insecure connection. User agents should block mixed downloads
  because they can escape the user agent's sandbox (in the case of an executable) or contain
  sensitive information (e.g., a downloaded bank statement). This is especially misleading because
  user agents typically indicates to the user that they are on a secure page while initiating and
  completing a mixed download.

  <h2 id="terms">Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dfn export local-lt="mixed">mixed content</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <a>request</a> is <strong>mixed content</strong> if its
      <a for="request">URL</a> is not a [=potentially trustworthy URL=] [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]]
      <strong>and</strong> the context responsible for
      loading it prohibits mixed security contexts (see
      [[#categorize-settings-object]] for a normative definition of the latter).

      A <a>response</a> is <strong>mixed content</strong> if it is an
      <a>unauthenticated response</a>, <strong>and</strong> the context
      responsible for loading it requires prohibits mixed security contexts.

      <div class="example">
        Inside a context that restricts mixed content
        (<code>https://secure.example.com/</code>, for example):

        1.  A request for the script <code>http://example.com/script.js</code>
            is <strong>mixed content</strong>. As script <a>requests</a> are
            <a>blockable</a>, the user agent will return a network error rather
            than loading the resource.

        2.  A request for the image <code>http://example.com/image.png</code> is
            <strong>mixed content</strong>. As image <a>requests</a> are
            <a>upgradeable</a>, the user agent might rewrite the URL as
            <code>https://example.com/image.png</code>, otherwise it will block
            the load.
      </div>

      Note: "Mixed content" was originally defined in
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wsc-ui/#securepage">section 5.3</a> of
      [[WSC-UI]]. This document updates that initial definition.

      Note: [[XML]] also defines an unrelated
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-mixed-content">"mixed content"</a>.
      concept. This is potentially confusing, but given the term's near
      ubiquitious usage in a security context across user agents for more than
      a decade, the practical risk of confusion seems low.

<section>
  <h2 id="categories">Content Categories</h2>

  In a perfect world, each user agent would be required to block all <a>mixed
  content</a> without exception. Unfortunately, that is impractical on today's
  Internet; a user agent needs to be more nuanced in its restrictions to avoid
  degrading the experience on a substantial number of websites.

  With that in mind, we here split mixed content into two categories:
  [[#category-upgradeable]] and [[#category-blockable]].

  <section>
    <h3 id="category-upgradeable">Upgradeable Content</h3>

    <p class="note">
        Upgradeable content was previously referred to as optionally-blockable in
    [[mixed-content]]
    </p>

    Mixed content is
    <dfn export lt="upgradeable mixed content" local-lt="upgradeable">upgradeable</dfn>
    when the risk of allowing its usage as <a>mixed content</a> is outweighed by the risk of
    breaking significant portions of the web. This could be because mixed usage of the resource type
    is sufficiently high, and because the resource is low-risk in and of itself. The fact that these
    resource types are upgradeable does not mean that they are <em>safe</em>, simply that
    they're less catastrophically dangerous than other resource types. For example, images and icons
    are often the central UI elements in an application's interface. If an attacker reversed the
    "Delete email" and "Reply" icons, there would be real impact to users.

    This category includes:

    *   Requests whose [=request/initiator=] is the empty string, and whose [=request/destination=]
        is "`image`".

        Note: This corresponds to most images loaded via <{img}> (including SVG documents loaded as
        images, as those are blocked from executing script or fetching subresources) and CSS
        ('background-image', 'border-image', etc). It does not include <{img}> elements that [=use
        srcset or picture=].

    *   Requests whose [=request/destination=] is "`video`".

        Note: This corresponds to video loaded via <{video}> and <{source}>.

    *   Requests whose [=request/destination=] is "`audio`".

        Note: This corresponds to audio loaded via <{audio}> and <{source}>.

    We further limit this category in [[#should-block-fetch]] by force-failing any CORS-enabled
    request. This means, for example, that mixed content images loaded via `<img crossorigin ...>`
    will be blocked. This is a good example of the general principle that content falls into this
    category <em>only</em> when it is too widely used to be blocked outright. The Working Group
    intends to carve out more blockable subsets as time goes on.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="category-blockable">Blockable Content</h3>

    Any mixed content that is not [=upgradeable=] as defined above is considered to be
    <dfn export lt="blockable mixed content" local-lt="blockable">blockable</dfn>. Typical examples
    of this kind of content include scripts, <a>plugin</a> data, data requested via
    {{XMLHttpRequest}}, and so on.

    Note: <a>Navigation requests</a> might target <a>top-level browsing contexts</a>; these are not
    considered mixed content. See [[#should-block-fetch]] for details.

    Note: Note that requests made on behalf of a plugin are blockable. We recognize, however, that
    user agents aren't always in a position to mediate these requests. NPAPI plugins, for instance,
    often have direct network access, and can generally bypass the user agent entirely. We recommend
    that user agents block these requests when possible, and that plugin vendors implement mixed
    content checking themselves to mitigate the risks outlined in this document.

  <section>
    <h3 export dfn id="upgrade-algorithm">Upgrade a mixed content |request| to a [=potentially trustworthy URL=], if appropriate</h3>

    Note: The Fetch specification will hook into this algorithm to upgrade upgradeable
    mixed content to HTTPS.

    Given a <a>Request</a> <var>request</var>, this algorithm will rewrite
    its <a for="request">URL</a> if the request is deemed to be upgradeable mixed content,
    via the following algorithm:

    <ol>
      <li>
        If one or more of the following conditions is met, return without modifying <var>request</var>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">URL</a> is a
            [=potentially trustworthy URL=].
          </li>
          <li>
            [[#categorize-settings-object]] returns "<code>Does Not Restrict Mixed Security
            Contents</code>" when applied to <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">client</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">mode</a> is <code>CORS</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">destination</a> is not "<code>image</code>",
            "<code>audio</code>", or "<code>video</code>".
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">destination</a> is "<code>image</code>"
            and <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">initiator</a> is "<code>imageset</code>".
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">URL</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a>
        is <code>http</code>,
        set <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">URL</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a>
        to <code>https</code>, and return.

        Note: Per [[url]], we do not modify the port because it will be set to null when the scheme
        is <code>http</code>, and interpreted as 443 once the scheme is changed
        to <code>https</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h3 id="existing-mix-algorithms">Existing Mixed Content Algorithms and Modifications</h3>

    Note: This section specifies modifications to existing mixed content algorithms to ignore the
    distinction between optionally-blockable and blockable mixed content, since all
    optionally-blockable mixed content will now be autoupgraded.
    [[mixed-content#should-block-fetch]] and [[mixed-content#should-block-response]] are
    replaced by the versions below, while [[mixed-content#categorize-settings-object]] is left
    unmodified (but included below since this will replace the [[mixed-content]] spec).


    section>
    <h3 id="categorize-settings-object">
      Does |settings| prohibit mixed security contexts?
    </h3>

    Both documents and workers have [=environment settings objects=] which
    may be examined according to the following algorithm in order to determine
    whether they restrict mixed content. This algorithm returns "`Prohibits
    Mixed Security Contexts`" or "`Does Not Prohibit Mixed Security Contexts`",
    as appropriate.

    Given an [=environment settings object=] (|settings|):

    1.  If |settings|' [=environment settings object/origin=] is a
        [=potentially trustworthy origin=], then return
        "`Prohibits Mixed Security Contexts`".

    2.  If |settings| has a <a>responsible document</a> |document|, then:

        1.  While |document| has an <a>embedding document</a>:

            1.  Set |document| to |document|'s <a>embedding document</a>.

            2.  Let |embedder settings| be |document|'s [=relevant settings object=].

            3.  If |embedder settings|'
                [=environment settings object/origin=] is a
                [=potentially trustworthy origin=], then return
                "`Prohibits Mixed Security Contexts`".

    3.  Return "`Does Not Restrict Mixed Security Contexts`".

    <div class="note">
      If a document has an <a>embedding document</a>, a user agent needs to
      check not only the document itself, but also the <a>top-level browsing
      context</a> in which the document is nested, as that is the context
      which controls the user's expectations regarding the security status of
      the resource she's loaded. For example:

      <div class="example">
        <code>http://a.com</code> loads <code>http://evil.com</code>. The
        insecure request will be allowed, as <code>a.com</code> was not loaded
        over a secure connection.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <code>https://a.com</code> loads <code>http://evil.com</code>. The
        insecure request will be blocked, as <code>a.com</code> was loaded over
        a secure connection.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <code>http://a.com</code> frames <code>https://b.com</code>, which
        loads <code>http://evil.com</code>. In this case, the insecure request
        to <code>evil.com</code> will be blocked, as <code>b.com</code> was
        loaded over a secure connection, even though <code>a.com</code> was not.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <code>https://a.com</code> frames a <code>data:</code> URL, which loads
        <code>http://evil.com</code>. In this case, the insecure request to
        <code>evil.com</code> will be blocked, as <code>a.com</code> was loaded
        over a secure connection, even though the framed <code>data:</code> URL
        would not block mixed content if loaded in a top-level context.
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 export dfn id="should-block-fetch">
      Should fetching <var>request</var> be blocked as mixed content?
    </h3>

    Note: The Fetch specification hooks into this algorithm to determine whether
    a request should be entirely blocked (e.g. because the request is for
    <a>blockable</a> content, and we can <em>assume</em> that it won't be
    loaded over a secure connection).

    Given a <a>Request</a> <var>request</var>, a user agent determines
    whether the <a>Request</a> <var>request</var> should proceed or not via the
    following algorithm:

    <ol>
      <li>
        Return <strong>allowed</strong> if one or more of the following
        conditions are met:

        <ol>
          <li>
            [[#categorize-settings-object]] returns "`Does Not Restrict Mixed
            Security Contexts`" when applied to |request|'s
            <a for="request">client</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            |request|'s <a for="request">URL</a> is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

          <li>
            The user agent has been instructed to allow <a>mixed content</a>, as

            context</a> has no <a>parent browsing context</a>.

            Note: We exclude top-level navigations from mixed content checks,
            but user agents MAY choose to enforce mixed content checks on
            insecure form submissions (see [[#requirements-forms]]).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>

    <h3 export dfn id="should-block-response">
      Should <var>response</var> to <var>request</var> be blocked as mixed
      content?
    </h3>

    Note: <a href="#should-block-fetch">If a request proceeds</a>, we still
    might want to block the response based on the state of the connection
    that generated the response (e.g. because the request is <a>blockable</a>,

    that a Service Worker doesn't accidentally return an <a>unauthenticated

    that determination.

    Given a <a>request</a> <var>request</var> and <a>response</a>

  <h2 id="integration">Integrations</h2>

  <h3 id="fetch">Modifications to Fetch</h3>

  [[fetch#main-fetch]] should be modified to call [[#upgrade-algorithm]] on <var>request</var>
  between steps 3 and 4. That is, upgradeable mixed content should be autoupgraded to HTTPS
  before applying mixed content blocking.

  <h3 id="html">Modifications to HTML</h3>

  <a>Process a navigate response</a> should be modified as follows. Step 3 should abort the download
  and return if <var ignore>source</var>'s <a>active document</a>'s <a for="Document">URL</a> is a
  [=potentially trustworthy URL=] and any URL
  in <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">URL list</a> is not a
  [=potentially trustworthy URL=].

  A similar change should be made to <a>download the hyperlink</a>. In this algorithm, step 6.2
  should be modified to return (aborting the download) if <var ignore>subject</var>'s <a>node
  document</a>'s <a for="Document">URL</a> is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=] and
  any URL in <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">URL list</a> is not a
  [=potentially trustworthy URL=] (where <var>response</var> is the result of
  fetching <var>request</var>).

  Note: Downloads are not autoupgraded like other types of mixed content, because the user agent
  does not always know before requesting a resource that it will be downloaded.

  Note: Resources are downloaded before the user agent decides whether to abort them based on an
  insecure connection. Sensitive information may therefore traverse the network even though the user
  agent eventually blocks the download. This is generally unavoidable because the user agent may not
  know that a resource is to be downloaded until it receives the final response, but by blocking the
  resource, user agents will encourage website operators to serve downloads over secure connections.

  <h2 id="obsolescences">Obsolescences</h2>

  <h3 id="strict-checking"><code>Strict Mixed Content Checking</code></h3>

  This specification renders the [[mixed-content#strict-checking]] mode and
  the <code>block-all-mixed-content</code> CSP directive obsolete,
  because all mixed content is now blocked if it can't be autoupgraded.

  Note: The <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> ([[upgrade-insecure-requests]]) directive is not
  obsolete because it allows developers to upgrade blockable content. This specification only
  upgrades upgradeable content by default.

  <h3 id="mixed-content-1"><code>Mixed Content</code></h3>

  This specification renders the [[mixed-content]] specification obsolete,
  and replaces it.

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

  Overall, autoupgrading upgradeable mixed content is expected to be security- and
  privacy-positive, by protecting more user traffic from network eavesdropping and tampering.

  There is a risk of introducing a security or privacy issue in a webpage by loading a resource that
  the developer did not intend. For example, suppose that a website includes an innocuous image
  from <code>http://www.example.com/image.jpg</code>, and for some
  reason <code>https://www.example.com/image.jpg</code> redirects to a tracking site. The browser
  will now have introduced a privacy issue without the developer's or user's explicit
  consent. However, these cases are expected to be exceedingly rare. The risk is mitigated by
  autoupgrading only upgradeable content, not blockable content as well. Blockable content
  could present more risk, for example the risk of loading an out-of-date and vulnerable JavaScript
  library.

    <h3 id="requirements-forms">Form Submission</h3>

    If [[#categorize-settings-object]] returns `Restricts Mixed Content` when applied to a
    {{Document}}'s [=relevant settings object=], then a user agent MAY choose to warn users of the
    presence of one or more <{form}> elements with <a element-attr>action</a> attributes whose
    values are not [=potentially trustworthy URL=]s.

    A user agent MAY choose to warn users on submission of a <{form}> element with
    <a element-attr>action</a> attributes whose values are not [=potentially trustworthy URL=]s
    and allow users to abort the submission. If a user agent warns on <{form}> element
    submissions to not [=potentially trustworthy URL=]s, it SHOULD also warn and allow users to
    abort the submission if upon submission, the <{form}> element's action, redirects to a
    non [=potentially trustworthy URL=], exposing the <{form}> information.

    Further, a user agent MAY treat form submissions from such a {{Document}} as a [=blockable=]
    request, even if the submission occurs in the [=top-level browsing context=].

    <h3 id="requirements-user-controls">User Controls</h3>
    A user agent MAY offer users the ability to override its decision to block
    <a>blockable</a> mixed content on a particular page.

    Note: Practically, a user agent probably can't get away with not offering
    such a back door. That said, allowing mixed script is in particular a very
    dangerous option, and each user agent
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919#section-3">REALLY SHOULD NOT</a>
    [[RFC6919]] present such a choice to users without careful consideration and
    communication of the risk involved.

    A user agent MAY offer users the ability to override its decision to
    automatically upgrade <a>upgradeable</a> mixed content on a
    particular page.

    Any such controls offered by a user agent MUST also be offered through
    accessibility APIs for users of assistive technologies.
