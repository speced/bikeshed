Introduction {#introduction}
============================

The Open Screen Protocol connects browsers to devices capable of rendering Web
content for a shared audience.  Typically, these are devices like
Internet-connected TVs, HDMI dongles, and smart speakers.

This spec defines a suite of network protocols that enable two user agents to
implement the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] and
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] in an interoperable fashion.  This means
that a Web developer can expect these APIs to work as intended when connecting
two devices from independent implementations of the Open Screen Protocol.

The Open Screen Protocol is a specific implementation of these two APIs, meaning
that it does not handle all possible ways that browsers and presentation
displays could support these APIs.  The Open Screen Protocol specifically
supports browsers and displays that are connected via the same local area
network.  It allows a browser to present a URL, initiate remote playback of an
HTML <l spec=html>[=media element=]</l>, and stream media data to another
device.

The Open Screen Protocol is intended to be extensible, so that additional
capabilities can be added over time.  This may include additions to existing Web
APIs or new Web APIs.

Terminology {#terminology}
--------------------------

An <dfn lt="open screen protocol agent|osp agent">Open Screen Protocol
agent</dfn> (or OSP agent) is any implementation of this protocol (browser,
display, speaker, or other software).

Some OSP agents support the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]].  The
API allows a [=controlling user agent=] to initiate presentation of Web content
on another device.  We call this agent a <dfn>controller</dfn> for short.  A
[=receiving user agent=] is responsible for rendering the Web content, which we
will call a <dfn>receiver</dfn> for short.  The the Web content itself is called
a [=presentation=].

Some OSP agents also support the [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]].  That
API allows an agent to render a <l spec="html">[=media element=]</l> on a
[=remote playback device=].  In this document, we refer to it as a [=receiver=]
because it is shorter and keeps terminology consistent between presentations and
remote playbacks. Similarly, we use the term [=controller=] to refer to the
agent that starts, terminates, and controls the remote playback.

For media streaming, we refer to an OSP agent that sends a media stream
as a <dfn>media sender</dfn> and an agent that receives a media stream as a
<dfn>media receiver</dfn>.  Note that an agent can be both a media sender and a
media receiver.

For additional terms and idioms specific to the
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] or [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]],
please consult the respective specifications.

Requirements {#requirements}
============================

General Requirements {#requirements-general}
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.  An [=Open Screen Protocol agent=] must be able to discover the presence of
    another OSP agent connected to the same IPv4 or IPv6 subnet and reachable by
    IP multicast.

2.  An OSP agent must be able to obtain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of
    the agent, a display name for the agent, and an IP port number for
    establishing a network transport to the agent.


Presentation API Requirements {#requirements-presentation-api}
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.  A [=controller=] must be able to determine if a [=receiver=] is reasonably
    capable of rendering a specific [=presentation request URL=].

2.  A controller must be able to start a new [=presentation=] on a
    receiver given a [=presentation request URL=] and [=presentation ID=].

3.  A controller must be able to create a new {{PresentationConnection}} to an
    existing presentation on the receiver, given its [=presentation request
    URL=] and [=presentation ID=].

4.  It must be possible to close a {{PresentationConnection}} between a
    controller and a presentation, and signal both parties with the reason why
    the connection was closed.

5.  Multiple controllers must be able to connect to a single presentation
    simultaneously.

6.  Messages sent by the controller must be delivered to the presentation (or
    vice versa) in a reliable and in-order fashion.

7.  If a message cannot be delivered, then the controller must be
    able to signal the receiver (or vice versa) that the connection should be
    closed with reason `error`.

8.  The controller and presentation must be able to send and receive `DOMString`
    messages (represented as `string` type in ECMAScript).

9.  The controller and presentation must be able to send and receive binary
    messages (represented as `Blob` objects in HTML5, or `ArrayBuffer` or
    `ArrayBufferView` types in ECMAScript).

10. The controller must be able to signal to the receiver to
    terminate a presentation, given its [=presentation request URL=] and [=presentation
    ID=].

11. The receiver must be able to signal all connected controllers
    when a presentation is terminated.


Remote Playback API Requirements {#requirements-remote-playback}
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  A [=controller=] must be able to find out whether there is at least one
    compatible [=receiver=] for a given {{HTMLMediaElement}}, both
    instantaneously and continuously.

2.  A controller must be able to to [=initiate remote playback=] of
    an {{HTMLMediaElement}} to a compatible receiver.

3.  The controller must be able send media sources as URLs and text
    tracks from an {{HTMLMediaElement}} to a compatible receiver.

4.  The controller must be able send media data from an {{HTMLMediaElement}} to
    a compatible receiver.

5.  During remote playback, the controller and the remote playback
    device must be able to synchronize the [=media element state=] of the
    {{HTMLMediaElement}}.

6.  During remote playback, either the controller or the receiver must be able
    to disconnect from the other party.

7.  The controller should be able to pass locale and text direction information
    to the receiver to assist in rendering text during remote playback.


Non-Functional Requirements {#requirements-non-functional}
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  It should be possible to implement an OSP agent using modest
    hardware requirements, similar to what is found in a low end smartphone,
    smart TV or streaming device. See the [Device
    Specifications](device_specs.md) document for agent hardware specifications.

2.  The discovery and connection protocols should minimize power consumption,
    especially on a [=listening agent=] which is likely to be battery
    powered.

3.  The protocol should minimize the amount of information provided to a passive
    network observer about the identity of the user or activities on the agent, including
    presentations, remote playbacks, or the content of media streams.

4.  The protocol should prevent active network attackers from impersonating a
    display and observing or altering data intended for the controller or
    receiver.

5.  A listening agent should be able to discover quickly when an [=advertising
    agent=] becomes available or unavailable (i.e., when it connects or
    disconnects from the network).

6.  Agents should present sensible information to the user when a protocol
    operation fails.  For example, if a controller is unable to start a
    presentation, it should be possible to report in the controller interface if
    it was a network error, authentication error, or the presentation content
    failed to load.

7.  Agents should be able to remember that a user authenticated another agent.
    This means it is not required for the user to intervene and re-authenticate
    each time an agent wants to connect to an agent that the user has already
    authenticated.

8.  Message latency between agents should be minimized to permit interactive
    use.  For example, it should be comfortable to type in a form in one agent
    and have the text appear in the presentation in real time.  Real-time
    latency for gaming or mouse use is ideal, but not a requirement.

9. The controller initiating a presentation or remote playback should
    communicate its preferred locale to the receiver, so it can render the
    content in that locale.

10. It should be possible to extend the control protocol (above the discovery and
    transport levels) with optional features not defined explicitly by the
    specification, to facilitate experimentation and enhancement of the base
    APIs.


Discovery with mDNS {#discovery}
===============================

[=Open Screen Protocol agents=] must discover one another using
[[RFC6763|DNS-SD]] over [[RFC6762|mDNS]].  To do so, OSP agents must use the
[=Service Name=] `_openscreen._udp.local`.

Issue(107): Define suspend and resume behavior for discovery protocol.

An <dfn noexport>advertising agent</dfn> is one that responds to mDNS queries
for `_openscreen._udp.local`.  Such an agent should have a <dfn noexport>display
name</dfn> (a non-empty string) that is a human readable description of the
presentation display, e.g. "Living Room TV."

A <dfn noexport>listening agent</dfn> is one that sends mDNS queries for
`_openscreen._udp.local`.  Listening agents may have a display name.

Advertising agents must use a DNS-SD [=Instance Name=] that is a prefix of the
agent's display name.  If the Instance Name is not the complete display name, it
must be terminated by a null (`\000`) character, so that a listening agent knows
it has been truncated.

Advertising agents must follow the mDNS [=conflict resolution=] procedure, to
prevent multiple advertising agents from using the same DNS-SD Instance Name.

Agents should be careful when displaying Instance Names to users; see
[[#instance-names]] for guidelines on Instance Name display.

Advertising agents must include DNS TXT records with the following
keys and values:

: fp
:: The <dfn>agent fingerprint</dfn> of the advertising agent, computed over the
    [=agent certificate=]. The format of the fingerprint is defined by [[!RFC5122]],
    excluding the "fingerprint:" prefix and including the hash function, space,
    and hex-encoded fingerprint.  The fingerprint value also functions as an ID
    for the agent. All agents must support the following hash functions: [=sha-256=],
    [=sha-512=].  Agents must not support the following hash functions: [=md2=], [=md5=].

: mv
:: An unsigned integer value that indicates that
    metadata has changed.   The advertising agent must update it to a greater
    value.  This signals to the listening agent that it should connect to the
    advertising agent to discover updated metadata.

: at
:: An alphanumeric, unguessable token consisting of characters from the set
    `[A-Za-z0-9+/]`.

Note: `at` prevents off-LAN parties from attempting authentication; see
[[#remote-active-mitigations]].  `at` should have at least 32 bits of true
entropy to make brute force attacks impractical.

Issue: Add examples of sample mDNS records.

Future extensions to this QUIC-based protocol can use the same metadata
discovery process to indicate support for those extensions, through a
capabilities mechanism to be determined. If a future version of the Open Screen
Protocol uses mDNS but breaks compatibility with the metadata discovery process,
it should change the DNS-SD service name to a new value, indicating a new
mechanism for metadata discovery.


Transport and metadata discovery with QUIC {#transport}
=======================================================

If a [=listening agent=] wants to connect to or learn further metadata about an
[=advertising agent=], it initiates a [[QUIC]] connection to the IP and port
from its SRV record.  Prior to authentication, a message may be exchanged (such
as further metadata), but such info should be treated as unverified (such as
indicating to a user that a display name of an unauthenticated agent is
unverified).

The connection IDs used both by agents should be zero length.  If zero length
connection IDs are chosen, agents are restricted from changing IP or port
without establishing a new QUIC connection.  In such cases, agents must
establish a new QUIC connection in order to change IP or port.

TLS 1.3 {#tls-13}
-----------------

When an [=OSP Agent=] makes a QUIC connection to another agent, it must use
[[!RFC8446|TLS 1.3]] to secure the connection.  TLS 1.3 must be used in the following
application profile:

* The [[!RFC7301|ALPN]] used must be "osp".
* Only constant-time AEAD ciphers are allowed.
    * OSP agents must support [[!RFC8446|TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256]].
    * OSP agents should support [[!RFC8466|TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256]] and
        [[!RFC8466|TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384]].
* OSP agents must support the [[!RFC8446|ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256]] digital signature algorithm.
    OSP agents should also support [[!RFC8466|ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384]] and
    [[!RFC8466|ecdsa_secp521r1_sha512]]. OSP agents must not support additional digital
    signature algorithms.
    * `ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256` must be included in the `signature_algorithms`
        extension.  `ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384` and `ecdsa_secp512r1_sha512` must be
        included if they are supported by the agent.
    * `secp256r1` must be included in the `supported_groups` extension.
        `secp384r1` and `secp512r1` must be included if they are supported by the
        agent.
    * The `key_share` extension must be set to the cryptographic parameters for
        the negotiated signature algoirithm.
* The `server_name` extension should be set to the following `host_name`:
    `<fp>._openscreen._udp.local`.
    * `<fp>` should be substituted with the [=agent fingerprint=] as used in mDNS TXT.
* All other TLS 1.3 extensions must be ignored by OSP agents.

Note: As this is an application-specific profile for TLS 1.3, it is not required
for OSP agents to interoperate with non-OSP TLS 1.3 endpoints.

Issue(228): Register ALPN with IANA.

Issue(220): Determine if there is an advantage to session resumption outside of
early data. If we allow session resumption, do we allow early data too?

Issue(219): Do agents need to support the Cookies extension (used in
HelloRetryRequest)?

Issue(218): Make recommendations for cipher and signature algorithm preference
list based on hardware characteristics of agents.

Agent Certificates {#certificates}
----------------------------------

Each OSP Agent must generate an [[!RFC5280|X.509 v3]] <dfn>agent
certificate</dfn> containing a public key to be used with the TLS 1.3
certificate exchange.  Both [=advertising agents=] and [=listening agents=] must
use the [=agent certificate=] in TLS 1.3 `Certificate` messages when making a
QUIC connection.

The [=agent certificate=] must have the following characteristics:

* 256-bit, 384-bit, or 521-bit ECDSA public key
* Self-signed
* Supporting the at least one of the following signature algorithms:
    * secp256r1_sha256
    * secp384r1_sha384
    * secp521r1_sha512
* Valid for signing

The following X.509 v3 fields are to be set as follows:

<table>
<thead>
 <th>Field</th>
 <th>Value</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
 <tr>
   <td>Version Number</td>
   <td>3</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Serial Number</td>
   <td>`<fp>`</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Signature Algorithm ID</td>
   <td>One of the values listed above.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Issuer Name</td>
   <td>CN = The `model-name` from the `agent-info` message.<br/>
       O = See note.<br/>
       L = See note.<br/>
       ST = See note.<br/>
       C = See note.<br/>
    </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Subject Name</td>
   <td>CN = `<fp>`._openscreen._udp.local<br/>
       O = See note.<br/>
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Subject Public Key Algorithm</td>
   <td>Elliptic Curve Public Key</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Certificate Key usage</td>
   <td>Signing</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Mandatory fields not mentioned above should be set according to [[!RFC5280]].

The value `<fp>` above should be substituted with the [=agent fingerprint=] (as
serialized in mDNS TXT).

Note: The OSP agent may use the implementer or device model name as the value
for the `O` key for user interface and debugging purposes. It may use the agent
implementer's or device manufacturer's location as the value for the location
keys (`L`, `ST`, and `C`) for user interface and debugging purposes.

If an OSP agent sees an [=agent certificate=] it has not yet verified through
[[#authentication]], it must treat that agent as unverified and initiate
authentication with that agent before allowing additional messages to be
exchanged with that agent (apart from the messages described in [[#metadata]]).

If an OSP agent sees a valid [=agent certificate=] it has verified through
authentication, it is not required to initiate authentication with that agent
before sending further messages.

Metadata Discovery {#metadata}
------------------------------

To learn further metadata, an agent may send an [=agent-info-request=] message
and receive back an [=agent-info-response=] message.  Any agent may send this
request at any time to learn about the state and capabilities of another device,
which are described by the [=agent-info=] message in the
[=agent-info-response=].

If an agent changes any information in its [=agent-info=] message, it should
send an [=agent-info-event=] message to all other connected agents with the new
[=agent-info=] (without waiting for an [=agent-info-request=]).

The [=agent-info=] message contains the following fields:

: display-name (required)
:: The display name of the agent, intended to be displayed to a user by the
     requester. The requester should indicate through the UI if the responder
     is not authenticated or if the display name changes.

: model-name (optional)
:: If the agent is a hardware device, the model name of
    the device.  This is used mainly for debugging purposes, but may be
    displayed to the user of the requesting agent.

: capabilities (required)
:: The control protocols, roles, and media types the agent supports.
    Presence indicates a capability and absence indicates lack of a
    capability.  Capabilities should should affect how an agent is
    presented to a user, such as drawing a different icon depending on
    the media types it supports.

: state-token (required)
:: A random alphanumeric value consisting of 8 characters in the range
    [0-9A-Za-z].  This value is set before the agent makes its first connection
    and must be set to a new value when the agent is reset or otherwise lost all
    of its state related to this protocol.

: locales (required)
:: The agent's preferred locales for display of localized content, in the order
    of user preference.  Each entry is an RFC5646 [=language tag=].

The various capabilities have the following meanings:

: receive-audio
:: The agent can generally receive audio for the control protocols it
    supports.  Each control protocol can have more specific capability
    mechanisms, such as support for specific URLs in the presentation
    protocol.

: receive-video
:: The agent can generally receive video for the control protocols it
    supports.  Each control protocol can have more specific capability
    mechanisms, such as support for specific URLs in the presentation
    protocol.

: receive-presentation
:: The agent can receive presentations using the presentation protocol.

: control-presentation
:: The agent can control presentations using the presentation protocol.

: receive-remote-playback
:: The agent can receive remote playback using the remote playback
    protocol.

: control-remote-playback
:: The agent can control remote playback using the remote playback
    protocol.

: receive-streaming
:: The agent can receiving streaming using the streaming protocol.

: send-streaming
:: The agent can send streaming using the streaming protocol.

Note: See the
[Capabilities Registry](https://w3c.github.io/openscreenprotocol/capabilities.md)
for a list of all known capabilities (both defined by this specification, and
through [[#protocol-extensions]]).


If a listening agent wishes to receive messages from an advertising agent or an
advertising agent wishes to send messages to a listening agent, it may wish to
keep the QUIC connection alive.  Once neither side needs to keep the connection
alive for the purposes of sending or receiving messages, the connection should
be closed with an error code of 5139.  In order to keep a QUIC connection alive, an
agent may send an [=agent-status-request=] message, and any agent that receives an
[=agent-status-request=] message should send an [=agent-status-response=] message. Such
messages should be sent more frequently than the QUIC idle_timeout transport
parameter (see [=Transport Parameter Encoding=] in [[QUIC]]) and QUIC PING
frames should not be used.  An idle_timeout transport parameter of 25 seconds is
recommended.  The agent should behave as though a timer less than the
idle_timeout were reset every time a message is sent on a QUIC stream.  If the
timer expires, a [=agent-status-request=] message should be sent.

If a listening agent wishes to send messages to an advertising agent, the
listening agent can connect to the advertising agent "on demand"; it does not
need to keep the connection alive.

Issue(108): Define suspend and resume behavior for connection protocol.

The [=agent-info=] and [=agent-status-response=] messages may be extended to
include additional information not defined in this spec, as described in
[[#protocol-extension-fields]].

Messages delivery using CBOR and QUIC streams {#messages}
========================================================

Messages are serialized using [[!RFC7049|CBOR]].  To send a group of messages in
order, that group of messages must be sent in one QUIC stream.  Independent
groups of messages (with no ordering dependency across groups) should be sent in
different QUIC streams.  In order to put multiple CBOR-serialized messages into
the the same QUIC stream, the following is used.

For each message, the [=OSP agent=] must write to the QUIC stream the following:

1.  A type key representing the type of the message, encoded as a variable-length
    integer (see [[#appendix-a]] for type keys)

2.  The message encoded as CBOR.

If an agent receives a message for which it does not recognize a type key, it
must close the QUIC connection with an application error code of 404 and should
include the unknown type key in the reason phrase of the [=CONNECTION_CLOSE
frame=].

Variable-length integers are encoded in the [=Variable-Length Integer Encoding=]
used by [[QUIC]].

Many messages are requests and responses, so a common format is defined for
those.  A request and a response includes a request ID which is an unsigned
integer chosen by the requester.  Responses must include the request ID of the
request they are associated with.

Type Key Backwards Compatibility {#message-compatibility}
--------------------------------

As messages are modified or extended over time, certain rules must be followed
to maintain backwards compatibiilty with agents that understand older versions
of messages.

1. If a required field is added to or removed from a message (either to/from the
    message directly or indirectly through the field of a field), a new type key
    must be assigned to the message.  Is is effectively a new message and must not
    be sent unless the receiving agent is known to understand the new type key.

1. If an optional field is added to a message (either to the message directly
    or indirectly through the field of a field), the type key may remain unchanged
    if the behavior of older receiving agents that do not understand the added field
    is compatible with newer sending agents that include the field.
    Otherwise, a new type key must be assigned.

1. If an optional field is removed from a message (either from the message
    directly or indirectly through the field of a field), the type key may remain
    unchanged if the behavior of newer receiving agents that do not understand the
    removed field is compatible with older sending agents that include the field.
    Otherwise, a new type key must be assigned.

1. Required fields may not be added or removed from array-based messages, such
    as audio-frame.



Authentication {#authentication}
================================

Each supported authentication method is implemeted via authentication messages
specific to that method.  The authentication method is explicitly specified by
the message itself.  The authentication status message is common for all authentication
methods.  Any new authentication method added must define new authentication messages.

[=Open Screen Protocol agents=] must implement [[#authentication-with-spake2]]
with pre-shared keys.

Prior to authentication, agents exchange [=auth-capabilities=] messages specifying
pre-shared key (PSK) ease of input for the user and supported PSK input methods.
The agent with the lowest PSK ease of input presents a PSK to the user when the agent
either sends or receives an authentication request.  In case both agents have the same
PSK ease of input value, the server presents the PSK to the user.  The same pre-shared key
is used by both agents.  The agent presenting the PSK to the user is the PSK presenter,
the agent requiring the user to input the PSK is the PSK consumer.

PSK ease of input is an integer in the range from 0 to 100 inclusive, where 0 means
it is not possible for the user to input PSK on this device and 100 means
that it's easy for the user to input PSK on the device.  Supported PSK input methods
are numeric and scanning a QR-code.  Devices with non-zero PSK ease of input must
support the numeric PSK input method.

Any authentication method may require an [=auth-initiation-token=] before
showing a PSK to the user or requesting PSK input from the user.  For an
[=advertising agent=], the `at` field in its mDNS TXT record must be used as the
`auth-initation-token` in the the first authentication message sent to or from
that agent.  Agents should discard any authentication message whose
`auth-initation-token` is set and does not match the `at` provided by the
advertising agent.

In the `psk-min-bits-of-entropy` field of the [=auth-capabilities=] messsage,
agents may specify the minimum bits of entropy it requires for a PSK, in the
range of 20 to 60 bits inclusive, with a default of 20.  The PSK presenter must
generate a PSK that has at least as many bits of entropy as it receives in this
field, and at least as many bits of entropy as it sends in this field.

If an agent chooses to show a user a PSK in more than one way (such as both a
QR-code and a numeric PSK), they should be for the same PSK.  If they were
different, the PSK presenter would not know which one the user chose to use, and
that may lead to authentication failures.

Authentication with SPAKE2 {#authentication-with-spake2}
--------------------------

For all messages and objects defined in this section, see Appendix A for
the full CDDL definitions.

The default authentication method is
\[SPAKE2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-spake2-08) with
the following cipher suite:

1. Elliptic curve is [Curve25519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#page-4).
2. Hash function is \[SHA-512](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234).
3. Key derivation function is \[HKDF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869).
4. Message authentication code is \[HMAC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104).
5. Password hash function is SHA-512.

Open Screen Protocol does not use a memory-hard hash function to hash PSKs
with SPAKE2 and uses SHA-512 instead as the PSK is one-time use and
is not stored in any form.

SPAKE2 provides explicit mutual authentication.

This authentication method assumes the agents share a low-entropy secret,
such as a number or a short password that could be entered by a user on a
phone, a keyboard or a TV remote control.

SPAKE2 is not symmetric and has two roles, Alice (A) and Bob (B).
The client acts as Alice, the server acts as Bob.

Issue: What do "client" and "server" mean here?

The messages used in this authentication method are: [=auth-spake2-need-psk=],
[=auth-spake2-handshake=], [=auth-spake2-confirmation=] and [=auth-status=].
SPAKE2 describes in detail how [=auth-spake2-handshake=] and
[=auth-spake2-confirmation=] are computed.

The values `A` and `B` used in SPAKE2 are the [=agent fingerprints=] of the
client and server, respectively. `K` is the PSK presented to the user.  `S` and
`T` from SPAKE2 are put into the `random` field of [=auth-spake2-handshake=].
`F` from SPAKE2 is put into the `transcript-mac` field of
[=auth-spake2-confirmation=].

If the PSK presenter wants to authenticate, the PSK presenter starts the
authentication process by presenting the PSK to the user and sending a
[=auth-spake2-handshake=] message. When the PSK consumer receives the
[=auth-spake2-handshake=] message, the PSK consumer prompts the user for the PSK input
if it has not done so yet.

If the PSK consumer wants to authenticate, the PSK consumer sends a
[=auth-spake2-need-psk=] message to the PSK presenter to start the authentication
process and prompts the user to input the PSK. If the PSK presenter receives a
[=auth-spake2-need-psk=] message after starting authentication from their side, the
PSK presenter ignores the [=auth-spake2-need-psk=] message.

After the user inputs the PSK into the PSK consumer, the PSK consumer computes
and sends a [=auth-spake2-handshake=].

When either agent both knows the PSK and has received a [=auth-spake2-handshake=]
message, the agent computes and sends a [=auth-spake2-confirmation=] message.

When either agent has received both [=auth-spake2-handshake=] and
[=auth-spake2-confirmation=] messages, the agent validates the confirmation message
and sends the [=auth-status=] authenticated message.

Presentation Protocol {#presentation-protocol}
=====================

This section defines the use of the Open Screen Protocol for starting,
terminating, and controlling presentations as defined by
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]]. [[#presentation-api]]
defines how APIs in [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] map to the
protocol messages defined in this section.

To learn which receivers are [=available presentation displays=] for a
particular [=presentation request URL=] or set of URLs, the controller may send
a [=presentation-url-availability-request=] message with the following values:

: urls
:: A list of presentation URLs.  Must not be empty.

: watch-duration
:: The period of time that the controller is interested in receiving updates
    about their URLs, should the availability change.

: watch-id
:: An identifier the receiver must use when sending updates about URL
    availability so that the controller knows which URLs the receiver is referring
    to.

In response, the receiver should send one [=presentation-url-availability-response=]
message with the following values:

: url-availabilities
:: A list of URL availability states.  Each state must correspond to the matching URL
    from the request by list index.


While the watch is valid (the watch-duration has not expired), the receivers
should send [=presentation-url-availability-event=] messages when URL
availabilities change.  Such events contain the following values:

: watch-id
:: The watch-id given in the [=presentation-url-availability-response=],
    used to refer to the presentation URLs whose availability has changed.

: url-availabilities
:: A list of URL availability states.  Each state must correspond to the URLs from the
    request referred to by the watch-id.

Note that these messages are not broadcasted to all controllers. They are sent
individually to controllers that have requested availability for the URLs that
have changed in availability state within the watch duration of the original
availability request.

To save power, the controller may disconnect the QUIC connection and
later reconnect to send availability requests and receive availability
responses and updates.  The QUIC connection ID may or may not be the same
when reconnecting.

To start a presentation, the controller may send a
[=presentation-start-request=] message to the receiver with the following
values:

: presentation-id
:: The presentation identifier

: url
:: The selected presentation URL

: headers
:: headers that the receiver should use to fetch the presentation URL.  For example,
    [[PRESENTATION-API#establishing-a-presentation-connection|section 6.6.1]] of
    the Presentation API says that the Accept-Language header should be
    provided.

The presentation ID must follow the restrictions defined by
[[PRESENTATION-API#common-idioms|section 6.1]] of the Presentation API, in that
it must consist of at least 16 ASCII characters.

When the receiver receives the [=presentation-start-request=], it should send back a
[=presentation-start-response=] message after either the presentation URL has been
fetched and loaded, or the receiver has failed to do so. If it has failed, it
must respond with the appropriate result (such as invalid-url or timeout).  If
it has succeeded, it must reply with a success result.

Additionally, the response must include the following:

: connection-id
:: An ID that both agents can use to send connection messages
    to each other.  It is chosen by the receiver for ease of implementation: if
    the message receiver chooses the connection-id, it may keep the ID unique
    across connections, thus making message demuxing/routing easier.

The response should include the following:

: http-response-code
:: The numeric HTTP response code that was returned from fetching the
    presentation URL (after redirects).

To send a presentation message, the controller or receiver may send a
[=presentation-connection-message=] with the following values:

: connection-id
:: The ID from the [=presentation-start-response=] or
    [=presentation-connection-open-response=] messages.

: message
:: The presentation message data.


To terminate a presentation, the controller may send a
[=presentation-termination-request=] message with the following values:

: presentation-id
:: The ID of the presentation to terminate.

: reason
:: Set to `application-request` if the application requested termination,
    or `user-request` if the user requested termination. (These are the only
    valid values for `reason` in a [=presentation-termination-request=].)

When a [=receiver=] receives a [=presentation-termination-request=], it should
send back a [=presentation-termination-response=] message to the requesting
controller.

It should also notify other controllers about the termination by sending
a [=presentation-termination-event=] message.  And it can send the same message if
it terminates a presentation without a request from a controller to do so. This
message contains the following values:

: presentation-id
:: The ID of the presentation that was terminated.

: source
:: Set to `controller` when the termination was in response to a
    [=presentation-termination-request=], or `receiver` otherwise.

: reason
:: The detailed reason why the presentation was terminated.

To accept incoming connection requests from controller, a receiver must receive
and process the [=presentation-connection-open-request=] message which contains the
following values:

: presentation-id
:: The ID of the presentation to connect to.

: url
:: The URL of the presentation to connect to.

The receiver should, upon receipt of a
[=presentation-connection-open-request=] message, send back a
[=presentation-connection-open-response=] message which contains the
following values:

: result
:: a code indicating success or failure, and the reason for the failure

: connection-id
:: An ID that both agents can use to send connection messages
    to each other.  It is chosen by the receiver for ease of implementation (if
    the message receiver chooses the connection-id, it may keep the ID unique
    across connections, thus making message demuxing/routing easier).

: connection-count
:: The new number of open connections to the presentation that received
    the incoming connection request.

If the [=presentation-connection-open-response=] message indicates success, the
receiver should also send a [=presentation-change-event=] to all other endpoints
that have an active presentation connection to that presentation with the
values:

: presentation-id
:: The ID of the presentation that just received a new presentation connection.

: connection-count
:: The new total number of open connections to that presentation.

A controller may close a connection without terminating the presentation by
sending a [=presentation-connection-close-event=] message to the receiver with the
following values:

: connection-id
:: The ID of the connection that was closed.

: reason
:: Set to `close-method-called` or `connection-object-discarded`.

The receiver may also close a connection without terminating a presentation.  If
it does so, it should send a [=presentation-connection-close-event=] message to the
controller with the following values:

: connection-id
:: The ID of the connection that was closed.

: reason
:: Set to `close-method-called` or `connection-object-discarded`.

: connection-count
:: The number of open presentation connections that remain.

If a receiver closes a presentation connection (for any reason), it should send
a [=presentation-change-event=] to all other controllers with an open connection
to that presentation with the values:

: presentation-id
:: The ID of the presentation that just closed a connection.

: connection-count
:: The number of open presentation connections that remain.

Note: When an agent closes a presentation connection, it is always successful,
so request and response messages are not needed.  A request to terminate a
presentation may succeed or fail, so a response message is required.


Presentation API {#presentation-api}
---------------------------------------------

An [=Open Screen Protocol agent=] that is a [=controlling user agent=] for the
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] must support the `control-presentation` capability.
An [=OSP agent=] that is a [=receiving user agent=] for the
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] must support the `receive-presentation` capability.
The same OSP agent may be a [=controlling user agent=] and a [=receiving user agent=].

Note: These roles are independent of which agent was the [=advertising agent=]
or the [=listening agent=] during discovery and connection establishment.

This is how the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] uses the
[[#presentation-protocol]]:

When [[PRESENTATION-API#the-list-of-available-presentation-displays|section
6.4.2]] says "This list of presentation displays ... is populated based on an
implementation specific discovery mechanism", the [=controller=] may
use the mDNS, QUIC, [=agent-info-request=], and
[=presentation-url-availability-request=] messages defined previously in this spec
to discover receivers.

When [[PRESENTATION-API#the-list-of-available-presentation-displays|section
6.4.2]] says "To further save power, ... implementation specific discovery of
presentation displays can be resumed or suspended.", the agent may use the
power saving mechanism defined in the previous section.

When [[PRESENTATION-API#starting-a-presentation-connection|section 6.3.4]] says
"Using an implementation specific mechanism, tell U to create a receiving
browsing context with D, presentationUrl, and I as parameters.", U (the
controller) may send a [=presentation-start-request=] message to D
(the receiver), with I for the presentation identifier and presentationUrl for
the selected presentation URL.

Issue(w3c/presentation-api#471): Once the Presentation API has text about
reconnecting via an implementation specific mechanism, quote that here and map
it to a message.

When [[PRESENTATION-API#sending-a-message-through-presentationconnection|section
6.5.2]] says "Using an implementation specific mechanism, transmit the contents
of messageOrData as the presentation message data and messageType as the
presentation message type to the destination browsing context", the
controller may send a [=presentation-connection-message=] with
messageOrData for the presentation message data.  Note that the messageType is
embedded in the encoded CBOR type and does not need an additional value in the
message.

When [[PRESENTATION-API#closing-a-presentationconnection|section 6.5.5]] says
"Start to signal to the destination browsing context the intention to close the
corresponding PresentationConnection", the agent may send a
[=presentation-connection-close-event=] message to the other agent with the
destination browsing context and a [=presentation-change-event=] when required.

When
[[PRESENTATION-API#terminating-a-presentation-in-a-controlling-browsing-context|section
6.5.6]] says "Send a termination request for the presentation to its receiving
user agent using an implementation specific mechanism", the controller may send
a [=presentation-termination-request=] message to the receiver with a `reason`
of `application-request`.

When [[PRESENTATION-API#monitoring-incoming-presentation-connections|section
6.7.1]]
says "it MUST listen to and accept incoming connection requests from a
controlling browsing context using an implementation specific
mechanism", the receiver must receive and process the
[=presentation-connection-open-request=].

When [[PRESENTATION-API#monitoring-incoming-presentation-connections|section
6.7.1]] says "Establish the connection between the controlling and receiving
browsing contexts using an implementation specific mechanism.", the receiver
must send a [=presentation-connection-open-response=] message and
[=presentation-change-event=] messages when required.


Remote Playback Protocol {#remote-playback-protocol}
========================

This section defines the use of the Open Screen Protocol for starting, terminating,
and controlling remote playback of media as defined by the
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]].  [[#remote-playback-api]] defines how
APIs in [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] map to the protocol messages
defined in this section.

For all messages defined in this section, see Appendix A for the full
CDDL definitions.

Issue(159): Refinements to Remote Playback protocol.

To learn which receivers are [=compatible remote playback devices=] for a
particular URL or set of URLs, the controller may send a
[=remote-playback-availability-request=] message with the following values:

: sources
:: A list of [=media resources=], the same as specified in the
    [=remote-playback-start-request=] message.  Must not be empty.

Issue(146): Remote Playback HTTP headers.

: headers
:: headers that the receiver should use to fetch the
    urls.  For example,
    [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#establishing-a-connection-with-a-remote-playback-device|section 6.2.4 of
    the Remote Playback API]] says that the Accept-Language header should be
    provided.

: watch-duration
:: The period of time that the controller is interested in receiving updates
    about their URLs, should the availability change.

: watch-id
:: An identifier the receiver must use when sending updates about URL
    availability so that the controller knows which URLs the receiver is referring
    to.

In response, the receiver should send a [=remote-playback-availability-response=]
message with the following values:

: url-availabilities
:: A list of URL availability states.  Each state must correspond to the matching URL
    from the request by list index.


The receivers should later (up to the current time plus request
watch-duration) send [=remote-playback-availability-event=]  messages if
URL availabilities change.  Such events contain the following values:

: watch-id
:: The watch-id given in the [=remote-playback-availability-response=]
    used to refer to the remote playback URLs whose availability has changed.

: url-availabilities
:: A list of URL availability states.  Each state must correspond to the URLs from the
    request referred to by the watch-id.

Note that these messages are not broadcasted to all controllers. They are sent
individually to controllers that have requested availability for the URLs that
have changed in availability state within the watch duration of the original
availability request.

To save power, the controller may disconnect the QUIC connection and
later reconnect to send availability requests and receive availability
responses and updates. The QUIC connection ID may or may not be the same
when reconnecting.

To start remote playback, the controller may send a
[=remote-playback-start-request=] message to the receiver with the following
values:

: remote-playback-id
:: An identifier for this remote playback.  It should be universally unique
    among all remote playbacks.

Note: A version 4 (pseudorandom) [=UUID=] is recommended as it meets the
requirements for a remote-playback-id.

: sources
:: The [=media resources=] that the controller has selected for playback
    on the receiver.  Each source must include a <{source/src|source URL}>
    and should include an <{source/type|extended MIME type}>.

: text-track-urls
:: URLs of text tracks associated with the [=media resources=].

: controls
:: Initial controls for modifying the initial state of the remote playback, as
    defined in [[#remote-playback-state-and-controls]].  The controller may send
    controls that are optional for the receiver to support before it knows the
    receiver supports them.  If the receiver does not support them, it will
    ignore them and the controller will learn that it does not support them from
    the [=remote-playback-start-response=] message.

: remoting (optional)
:: Parameters for starting a streaming session associated with this
    remote playback.  If not included, no streaming session is started.

When the receiver receives a [=remote-playback-start-request=] message, it should
send back a [=remote-playback-start-response=] message.  It should do so quickly,
usually before the [=media resource=] has been loaded and instead give updates
of the progress of  loading with [=remote-playback-state-event=] messages, unless
the receiver decides to not attempt to load the resource at all.  If it chooses
not to, it must respond with the appropriate failure result (such as timeout or
invalid-url).  Additionally, the response must include the following:

: state
:: The initial state of the remote playback, as defined in
    [[#remote-playback-state-and-controls]].

: remoting (optional)
:: A response to the started streaming session associated with this remote playback.
    If not included, no streaming session is started.

If a streaming session is started, streaming messages such a
[=streaming-session-modify-request=] and [=video-frame=] can be used for the
streaming session as if the streaming session had been started with
[=streaming-session-start-request=] and
[=streaming-session-start-response=]. The streaming session may be terminated
before the remote playback is terminated, but if the remote playback is
terminated first, the streaming session associated with it is automatically
terminated.

If the controller wishes to modify the state of the remote playback (for
example, to pause, resume, skip, etc), it may send a
[=remote-playback-modify-request=] message with the following values:

: remote-playback-id
:: The ID of the remote playback to be modified.

: controls
:: Updated controls as defined in [[#remote-playback-state-and-controls]].

When a receiver receives a [=remote-playback-modify-request=] it should send a
[=remote-playback-modify-response=] message in reply with the following values:

: state
:: The updated state of the remote playback as defined in
    [[#remote-playback-state-and-controls]].

When the state of remote playback changes without request for modification from
the controller (such as when the skips or pauses due to user user interaction on
the receiver), the receiver may send a [=remote-playback-state-event=] to the
controller.

The receiver should send a [=remote-playback-state-event=] message whenever:

Any of the following methods are called:

* [HtmlMediaElement.fastSeek()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-fastseek)

More than 350ms pass since the last [=remote-playback-state-event=] message

  [=remote-playback-state-event=] message. Any new continuously changing
  attributes fall under this rule.

: remote-playback-id
:: The ID of the remote playback whose state has changed.

: state
:: The updated state of the remote playback, as defined in
    [[#remote-playback-state-and-controls]].


To terminate the remote playback, the controller may send a
[=remote-playback-termination-request=] message with the following values:

: remote-playback-id
:: The ID of the remote playback to terminate.

: reason
:: The reason the remote playback is being terminated.

When a receiver receives a [=remote-playback-termination-request=], it should
send back a [=remote-playback-termination-response=] message to the controller.

If a receiver terminates a remote playback without a request from the controller
to do so, it must send a [=remote-playback-termination-event=] message to the
controller with the following values:

: remote-playback-id
:: The ID of the remote playback that was terminated.

: reason
:: The reason the remote playback was terminated.

As mentioned in
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#disconnecting-from-a-remote-playback-device|Remote Playback
API section 6.2.7]], terminating the remote playback means the controller is no
longer controlling the remote playback and does not necessarily stop media from
rendering on the receiver.  Whether or not the receiver stops rendering media depends
upon the implementation of the receiver.

Remote Playback State and Controls {#remote-playback-state-and-controls}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for the controller and receiver to stay in sync with regards to the
state of the remote playback, the controller may send controls to modify the state
(for example, via the [=remote-playback-modify-request=] message) and the receiver
may send updates about state changes (for example, via the
[=remote-playback-state-event=] message).

The controls sent by the controller include the following individual control
values, each of which is optional.  This allows the controller to change one
control value or many control values at once without having to specify all
control values every time.  A non-present control value indicates no change.  A
present control value indicates the change defined below. These controls
intentionally mirror settable attributes and methods of the
[HtmlMediaElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement).

: source-url
:: Change the [=media resource=] URL. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.src](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-src)
    for more details. Must not be used in the initial controls of the
    [=remote-playback-start-request=] message (which already contains a list of URLs).

: preload
:: Set how aggressively to preload media. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.preload](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-preload)
    for more details. Should only be used in the initial controls of the
    [=remote-playback-start-request=] message or when the source is changed.  If not
    set in the initial controls, it is left to the receiver to decide.  This is
    optional for the receiver to support and if not supported, the receiver will
    behave as though it were never set.

: loop
:: Set whether or not to loop media. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.loop](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-loop)
    for more details. Should only be used in the initial control of the
    [=remote-playback-start-request=].  If not set in the initial controls, it is
    assumed to be false.

: paused
:: If true, pause; if false, resume. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.pause()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-pause).
    and
    [HtmlMediaElement.play()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-play)
    for more details.  If not set in the initial controls, it is left to the
    receiver to decide.

: muted
:: If true, mute; if false, unmute. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.muted](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-muted)
    for more details.  If not set in the initial controls, it is left to the
    receiver to decide.

: volume
:: Set the audio volume in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.volume](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-volume)
    for more details.  If not set in the initial controls, it is left to the
    receiver to decide.

: seek
:: Seek to a precise time. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.currentTime](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-currenttime)
    for more details.

: fast-seek
:: Seek to an approximate time as fast as possible. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.fastSeek()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-fastseek)
    for more details.

: playback-rate
:: Set the rate a which the media plays. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.playbackRate](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-playbackrate)
    for more details.  If not set in the initial controls, it is left to the
    receiver to decide.  This is optional for the receiver to support and if not
    supported, the receiver will behave as though it were never set.

: poster
:: Set the URL of an image to show when video data is not available. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.poster](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-poster)
    for more details. If not set in the initial controls, no poster is used and
    the receiver can choose what to render when video data is unavailable.  This
    is optional for the receiver to support and if not supported, the receiver
    will behave as though it were never set.

: enabled-audio-track-ids
:: Enable included audio tracks by ID and disable all other audio tracks. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.audioTracks](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-audiotracks)
    for more details.

: selected-video-track-id
:: Select the given video track by ID and unselect all other video tracks. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.videoTracks](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-videotracks)
    for more details.

: added-text-tracks
:: Add text tracks with the given kinds, labels, and languages. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.addTextTrack](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-addtexttrack)
    for more details.  This is optional for the receiver to support and if not
    supported, the receiver will behave as though it were never set.

: changed-text-tracks
:: Change text tracks by ID.  All other text tracks are left
    unchanged.  Set the mode, add cues, and remove cues by id. See
    [HtmlMediaElement.textTracks](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-texttracks)
    for more details.  Note that future specifications or extensions to this
    specifications are expected to add new fields to the [=text-track-cue=]
    (such as text size, alignment, position, etc).  Adding and removing
    cues is optional for the receiver to support and if not supported, the
    receiver will behave as though no cues were added or removed (both adding
    and removing are indicated via the support for "added-cues").  As specified in
    [HtmlMediaElement.textTracks](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-texttracks),
    if a cue ID is invalid (removing an un-added ID or adding an ID twice, for example),
    the receiver may reject the text track change.

    The default is an empty array
    for the initial state in the [=remote-playback-start-response=] message.

All times, time ranges, and durations (such as position, duration, and
seekable-time-ranges) used above use a common [=media-time=] value (see Appendix A)
which includes a time scale.  This allows time values which work on different
time scales to be expressed without loss of precision.  The scale is represented
in hertz, such as 90000 for 90000 Hz, a common time scale for video.

Remote Playback API {#remote-playback-api}
------------------------------------------

An [=Open Screen Protocol agent=] that implements the
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] must support the
`control-remote-playback` capability.  It may support the `send-streaming`
capability so it can send {{HTMLMediaElement}} media data through media
remoting.

An an [=OSP agent=] that is a [=remote playback device=] for the
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] must support the
`receive-remote-playback` capability.  It may support the `receive-streaming`
capability so it can receive {{HTMLMediaElement}} data through media remoting.

The same OSP agent may implement both the [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]]
and be a [=remote playback device=] for that API.

Note: These roles are independent of which agent was the [=advertising agent=]
or the [=listening agent=] during discovery and connection establishment.

This is how the [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] uses the
messages defined in [[#remote-playback-protocol]]:

When [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#the-list-of-available-remote-playback-devices|section
6.2.1.2]] says "This list contains [=remote playback devices=] and is populated
based on an implementation specific discovery mechanism" and
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#the-list-of-available-remote-playback-devices|section
6.2.1.4]] says "Retrieve available remote playback devices (using an
implementation specific mechanism)", the user agent may use the mDNS, QUIC,
[=agent-info-request=], and [=remote-playback-availability-request=] messages
defined previously in this spec to discover [=receivers=].  The
[=remote-playback-availability-request=] URLs must contain the [=availability
sources set=].

When
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#establishing-a-connection-with-a-remote-playback-device|section
6.2.4]] says "Request connection of remote to device. The implementation of this
step is specific to the user agent." and "Synchronize the current media element
state with the remote playback state", the controller may send the
[=remote-playback-start-request=] message to the receiver to start remote
playback.  The [=remote-playback-start-request=] URLs must contain the [=remote
playback source=].  The current [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] only
allows a single source, but the protocol allows for several and future versions
of [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] may allow for several.

When
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#establishing-a-connection-with-a-remote-playback-device|section
6.2.4]] says "The mechanism that is used to connect the user agent with the
remote playback device and play the remote playback source is an implementation
choice of the user agent. The connection will likely have to provide a two-way
messaging abstraction capable of carrying media commands to the remote playback
device and receiving media playback state in order to keep the media element
state and remote playback state in sync", the controller may send
[=remote-playback-modify-request=] messages to the receiver to change the remote playback state
based on changes to the local media element and receive
[=remote-playback-modify-response=] and [=remote-playback-state-event=] messages to
change the local media element based on changes to the remote playback state.

When
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#establishing-a-connection-with-a-remote-playback-device|section
6.2.7]] says "Request disconnection of remote from the device. The
implementation of this step is specific to the user agent," the controller may
send the [=remote-playback-termination-request=] message to the receiver.


Streaming Protocol {#streaming-protocol}
========================================

This section defines the use of the Open Screen Protocol for streaming
media from a [=media sender=] to a [=media receiver=].

If an [=Open Screen Protocol agent=] is a media sender, it must advertise the
`send-streaming` capability.  If an OSP agent is a media receiver, it must
advertise the `receive-streaming` capability.  The same agent may be a media
sender and a media receiver.

Note: These roles are independent of which agent was the [=advertising agent=]
or the [=listening agent=] during discovery and connection establishment.

Streaming Protocol Capabilities {#streaming-protocol-capabilities}
--------------------------------------------
If the advertiser is already authenticated, the requester has the ability to
request additional information by sending an [=streaming-capabilities-request=]
message, and receive back a [=streaming-capabilities-response=] message with the
following fields:

: receive-audio (required)
:: A list of capabilities for receiving audio. For an explanation of fields, see below.

: receive-video (required)
:: A list of capabilities for receiving video. For an explanation of fields, see below.


The format type is used as the basis for audio and video capabilities.
Formats are composed of the following fields:

: name (required)
:: The name of the codec.   This must be a single-codec RFC 6381 [=codecs parameter=].

<!-- TODO, specify where codec-specific parameters are defined. -->

: parameters (required)
:: A list of (key, value) parameters that can be used to describe
    properties of a specific format, and not shared by other formats
    of that type (audio, video, etc.).

Audio capabilities are composed of the above format type, with the following
additional fields:

: max-audio-channels (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the maximum amount of audio
    channels the media receiver is capable of supporting. Default value is "2," meaning
    a stereo speaker channel setup.

: min-bit-rate (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the minimum audio bit rate that
    the media receiver can handle, in kilobits per second. Default is no minimum.

Video capabilities are similarly composed of the above format type, with the
following additional fields:

: max-resolution (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the maximum video-resolution (width, height)
    that the media receiver is capable of processing. Default is no maximum.

: max-frames-per-second (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the maximum frames-per-second the media receiver is
    capable of processing. Default is no maximum.

: max-pixels-per-second (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the maximum pixels-per-second the media receiver is
    capable of processing, in pixels per second. Default is no maximum.

: min-video-bit-rate (optional)
:: An optional field indicating the minimum video bit rate the device is
    capable of processing, in kilobits per second. Default is no minimum.

: aspect-ratio (optional)
:: An optional field indicating what its ideal aspect ratio is, e.g. a 16:10
    display could return this value as 1.6 to indicate its preferred content
    scaling. Default is none.

: color-profiles (optional)
:: An optional field indicating what color profiles are understood.
    The listener may use these values to determine how to encode
    video. Some examples include: sRGBv4, Rec709, DciP3. The default value is sRGBv4.

: native-resolutions (optional)
:: An optional field indicating what video-resolutions the media receiver supports and
    considers to be "native," meaning that scaling is not required.
    The default value is none.

: supports-scaling (optional)
:: An optional boolean field indicating whether the media receiver can scale
    content provided in a video-resolution not listed in the native-resolutions
    list (if provided) or of a different aspect ratio. The default value is
    true.

: supports-rotation (optional)
:: An optional boolean field indicating whether the media receiver can receive
    video frames with the rotation field set. The default value is true.

<!-- TODO: Add max-bit-rate, color profiles, HDR -->

Sessions {#streaming-sessions}
------------------------------------

To start a streaming session, a sender may send a
[=streaming-session-start-request=] message with the following fields:

: streaming-session-id
:: Identifies the streaming session.  Must be unique for the (sender,
    receiver) pair.  Can be used later to modify or terminate a
    streaming session.  These IDs should be treated like other IDs
    with regards to the `state-token` as specified in
    [[#requests-responses-watches]].

: desired-stats-interval
:: Indicates the frequency the receiver should send stats messages to
    the sender.

: stream-offers
:: Indicates the streams that the receiver can request from the sender.

Each stream offer contains the following fields:

: media-stream-id
:: Identifies the media stream being offered.  Must be unique within
    the streaming session.  Can be used by the receiver to request the
    media session.  These IDs should be treated like other IDs
    with regards to the `state-token` as specified in
    [[#requests-responses-watches]].

: display-name
:: An optional name intended to be shown to a user, such that the
    receiver may allow the user to choose which media streams to
    receive, or if they are received automatically by the receiver,
    give the user some information about what the media stream is.

: audio
:: A list of audio encodings offered.  An audio encoding is a series
    of encoded audio frames.  Encodings define fields needed by
    the receiver to know how to decode the encoding, such as codec and
    sample rate.  They can differ by codec and related fields,
    but should be different encodings of the same audio.

: video
:: A list of video encodings offered.  A video encoding is a series of
    encoded video frames.  Encodings define fields needed by the
    receiver to know how to decode the encoding, such as codec and
    default duration.  They can differ by codec and potentially other
    fields, but should be different encodings of the same video.

: data
:: A list of data encodings offered.  A data encoding is a series of
    data frames.  Encodings define fields needed by the
    receiver to know how to interpret the encoding, such as data type and
    default duration.  They can differ by data type and potentially other
    fields, but should be different encodings of the same data.
    (For encodings of different data, use distinct media streams,
     not distinct encodints with the same media stream).


Each audio encoding offered defines the following fields:

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the audio encoding being offered.  Must be unique within
    the media stream.  These IDs should be treated like request IDs
    with regards to the `state-token` as specified in
    [[#requests-responses-watches]].

: codec-name
:: The name of the codec used by the encoding.  This must be a single-codec
    RFC 6381 [=codecs parameter=].

: time-scale
:: The time scale used by all audio frames.  This allows senders to
    make audio-frame messages smaller by not including the time scale
    in each one.

: default-duration:
:: The duration of an audio frame.  This allows senders to make
    audio-frame messages smaller by not including the duration for
    audio-frame messages that have the default duration.

Each video encoding offered defines the following fields:

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the video encoding being offered.  Must be unique within
    the media stream.  These IDs should be treated like request IDs
    with regards to the `state-token` as specified in
    [[#requests-responses-watches]].

: codec-name
:: The name of the codec used by the encoding.

: time-scale
:: The time scale used by all video frames.  This allows senders to
    make video-frame messages smaller by not including the time scale
    in each one.

: default-duration:
:: The default duration of a video frame.  This allows senders to make
    video-frame messages smaller by not including the duration for
    video-frame messages that have the default duration.

: default-rotation:
:: The default rotation of a video frame.  This allows senders to make
    video-frame messages smaller by not including the rotation for
    video-frame messages that have the default rotation.

Each data encoding offered defines the following fields:

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the data encoding being offered.  Must be unique within
    the media stream.  These IDs should be treated like request IDs
    with regards to the `state-token` as specified in
    [[#requests-responses-watches]].

: data-type-name
:: The name of the data type used by the encoding.

: time-scale
:: The time scale used by all data frames.  This allows senders to
    make data-frame messages smaller by not including the time scale
    in each one.

: default-duration:
:: The duration of an data frame .  This allows senders to make
    data-frame messages smaller by not including the duration for
    data-frame messages that have the default duration.

After receiving a [=streaming-session-start-request=] message, a receiver
should send back a [=streaming-session-start-response=] message with the
following fields:

: desired-stats-interval
:: Indicates the frequency the sender should send stats messages to
    the receiver.

: stream-requests
:: Indicates which media streams the receiver would like to receive
    from the sender.

Each stream request contains the following fields:

: media-stream-id
:: The ID of the stream reqeusted.

: audio (optional)
:: The requested audio encoding, by encoding ID

: video (optional)
:: The requested video encoding, by encoding ID.  It may
    include a target resolution and maximum frame rate.  The sender
    should not exceed the maximum frame rate and should attempt to
    send at the target bitrate, possibly exceeding it by a small amount.

: data (optional)
:: The requested data encoding, by encoding ID


During a streaming session, the receiver can modify the requests it
made for encodings by sending a [=streaming-session-modify-request=]
containing a modified list of stream-requests.  When the sender receives
a [=streaming-session-modify-request=], it should send back a
[=streaming-session-modify-response=] indicate whether or not the
application of the new request from the
[=streaming-session-modify-request=] was successful.

Finally, the sender may terminate the streaming session by sending
a [=streaming-session-terminate-request=] command.  When the receiver
receives the [=streaming-session-terminate-request=], it should send back
a [=streaming-session-terminate-response=].  The receiver can terminate at
any point and notify the sender by sending a
[=streaming-session-terminate-event=] message.

Audio {#streaming-audio}
------------------------------

[=Media senders=] may send audio to [=media receivers=] by sending
[=audio-frame=] messages (see [[#appendix-a]]) with the following keys and
values.  An audio frame message contains a set of encoded audio samples for a
range of time. A series of encoded audio frames that share a codec, codec
parameters and a timeline form an audio encoding.

Unlike most Open Screen Protocol messages, this one uses an
array-based grouping rather than a struct-based grouping.  For
required fields, this allows for a more efficient use of bytes on the
wire, which is important for streaming audio because the payload is
typically so small and every byte of overhead is relatively large.  In
order to accomodate optional values in the array-based grouping, one
optional field in the array is used to hold all optional values in a
struct-based grouping.  This will hopefully provide a good balance of
efficiency and flexibility.

To allow for audio frames to be sent out of order, they should be sent in
separate QUIC streams.

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the media encoding to which this audio frame belongs.  This can be
    used to reference fields of the encoding (from the
    [=audio-encoding-offer=] message) such as the codec, codec properties,
    time scale (aka clock rate or sample rate), and default duration.
    Referencing fields of the encoding through the encoding id
    helps to avoid sending duplicate information in every frame.

: start-time
:: Identifies the beginning of the time range of the audio frame. The
    end time can be inferred from the start time and duration. The
    time scale is equal to the value in the `time-scale` field of the
    [=audio-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: duration
:: If present, the duration of the audio frame. If not present, the
    duration is equal to the `default-duration` field of the
    [=audio-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.
    The time scale is equal to the value in the `time-scale` field of
    the [=audio-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: sync-time
:: If present, a time used to synchronize the start time of this audio frame (and
    thus, this encoding) with that of other media encodings on
    different timelines.  It may be wall clock time, but it need not
    be; it can be any clock chosen by the media sender.

: payload
:: The encoded audio.  The codec and codec parameters are equal to the
    `format` field of the [=audio-encoding-offer=] message referenced by
    the `encoding-id`

Video {#streaming-video}
--------------------------------------------

Media senders may send video to media receivers by sending [=video-frame=]
messages (see [[#appendix-a]]) with the following keys and values.  A video
frame message contains an encoded video frame (an encoded image) at a specific
point in time or over a specfic time range (if the duration is known).  A series
of encoded video frames that share a codec, codec parameters and a timeline form
a video encoding.

To allow for video frames to be sent out of order, they may be sent in
separate QUIC streams.  If the encoding is a long chain of encoded video frames
dependent on the previous one back until an independent frame, it may make sense
to send them in a single QUIC stream starting at the indepdendent frame and
ending at the last dependent frame.

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the media encoding to which this video frame belongs.
    This can be used to reference fields of the encoding such as the
    codec, codec properties, time scale, and default rotation.
    Referencing fields of the encoding through the encoding id helps
    to avoid sending duplicate information in every frame.

: sequence-number
:: Identifies the frame and its order in the encoding.
    Within an encoding, larger sequence numbers mean later start times.
    Within an encoding, gaps in sequence numbers mean frames are missing.

: depends-on
:: If present, the sequence numbers of the frames this frame depends on.
    If a sequence numbers is negative, it is treated as a relative sequence numbers
    and the sequence numbers is calculated by adding it to the sequence number of this frame.
    If empty, this is an independent frame (a key frame).
    If not present, the default value is [-1].

: start-time
:: Identifies the beginning of the time range of the video frame.  The
    end time can be inferred from the start time and duration. The
    time scale is equal to the value in the `time-scale` field of the
    [=video-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: duration
:: If present, the duration of the video frame. If not present, that
    means duration is unknown.  The time scale is equal to the value
    in the `time-scale` field of the [=video-encoding-offer=] message
    referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: sync-time
:: If present, a time used to synchronize the start time of this frame (and
    thus, this encoding) with that of other media encodings on different
    timelines.

: rotation
:: If present, indicates how the frame should be rotated after
    decoding but before rendering.  Rotation is clockwise in
    increments of 90 degrees.  The default is equal to the
    `default-rotation` field of the [=video-encoding-offer=] message
    referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: payload
:: The encoded video frame (encoded image).  The codec and codec
     parameters are are equal to the `format` field of the
     [=audio-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

Data {#streaming-data}
------------------------------------

Media senders may send timed data to media receivers by sending [=data-frame=] messages (see
[[#appendix-a]]) with the following keys and values.  A data frame message
contains an arbitrary payload that can be synchronized with audio and video.
A series of data frames that share a data type and timeline form a data encoding.

To allow for data frames to be sent out of order, they may be sent in separate
QUIC streams, but more than one data frame may be sent in one QUIC stream if
that makes sense for a specific type of data.

: encoding-id
:: Identifies the data encoding to which this data frame belongs.  This can be
    used to reference fields of the encoding such as the type of data and
    time scale.  Referencing fields of the encoding through the encoding id
    helps to avoid sending duplicate information in every frame.

: sequence-number
:: Identifies the frame and its order in the encoding.
    Within an encoding, larger sequence numbers mean later start times.
    Within an encoding, gaps in sequence numbers mean frames are missing.

: start-time
:: Identifies the beginning of the time range of the data frame.  The
    end time can be inferred from the start time and duration.  The
    time scale is equal to the value in the `time-scale` field of the
    [=data-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: duration
:: If present, the duration of the data frame. If not present, the
    duration is equal to the `default-duration` field of the
    [=data-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.
    The time scale is equal to the value in the `time-scale` field of
    the [=data-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

: sync-time
:: If present, a time used to synchronize the start time of this data frame (and
    thus, this encoding) with that of other media encodings on different
    timelines.

: payload
:: The data.  The data type is equal to the `data-type` field of the
    the [=data-encoding-offer=] message referenced by the `encoding-id`.

Feedback {#streaming-feedback}
------------------------------------

The media receiver can send feedback to the media sender, such as key frame
requests.

A video key frame is requested by sending a video-request message with
the following keys and values.

To allow for video frames to be sent out of order, they may be sent in separate
QUIC streams.

: encoding-id
:: The encoding for which the media sender should send a new key frame.

: sequence-number
:: Gives the order in the encoding.
    Within an encoding, larger sequence numbers invalidate previous ones.
    A media sender may ignore smaller sequence numbers after a larger one has been processed.
    This it to prevent out-of-order requests from generating more key frames than necessary.

: highest-decoded-frame-sequence-number: uint
:: If set, the media sender may generate a video frame dependent on the last decoded
    frame.  If not set, the media sender must generate an indepdendent (key) frame.

Stats {#streaming-stats}
------------------------------

During a streaming session, the sender should send stats with the
[=streaming-session-sender-stats-event=] at the interval the receiver requested.  It
should send all of the following stats for all of the media streams it is
sending. The [=streaming-session-sender-stats-event=] message contains the following
fields:

: streaming-session-id
:: The ID of the streaming session these stats apply to.

: system-time
:: The time when the stats were calculated, using a monotonic system
    clock.

: audio
:: Stats specific to audio.  Stats for multiple encodings can be sent
    at once, but encodings need not be included if the stats haven't
    changed.  See below.

: video
:: Stats specific to video.  Stats for multiple encodings can be sent
    at once, but encodings need not be included if the stats haven't
    changed.  See below.

Audio encoding sender stats include the following fields:

: encoding-id
:: The ID of the encoding for which the stats apply.

: cumulative-sent-frames
:: The total number of frames sent.

: cumulative-encode-delay
:: The sum of the time spent encoding frames sent.

Video encoding sender stats include the following fields:

: encoding-id
:: The ID of the encoding for which the stats apply.

: cumulative-sent-duration
:: The sum of all of the durations of all of the audio frames sent.

: cumulative-encode-delay
:: The sum of the time spent encoding frames sent.

: cumulative-dropped frames
:: The total number of frames that were not sent due to network, CPU,
    or other contraints.


During a streaming session, the receiver should send stats with the
[=streaming-session-receiver-stats-event=] at the interval the sender requested.
It should send all of the following stats for all of the media streams it is
receiving.  The [=streaming-session-receiver-stats-event=] message contains the
following fields:

: streaming-session-id
:: The ID of the streaming session these stats apply to.

: system-time
:: The time when the stats were calculated, using a monotonic system
    clock.

: audio
:: Stats specific to audio.  Stats for multiple encodings can be sent
    at once, but encodings need not be included if the stats haven't
    changed.  See below.

: video
:: Stats specific to video.  Stats for multiple encodings can be sent
    at once, but encodings need not be included if the stats haven't
    changed.  See below.

Audio encoding receiver stats include the following fields.  If not
present, that indicates the value has not changed since the last value.

: encoding-id
:: The ID of the encoding for which the stats apply.

: cumulative-decoded-frames
:: The total number of audio frames received and decoded.

: cumulative-received-duration
:: The sum of all of the durations of all of the audio frames received.

: cumulative-lost-duration
:: The sum of all of the durations of all of the audio frames detected as lost.

: cumulative-buffer-delay
:: The sum of the time frames spent buffered between receipt and playout.

: cumulative-decode-delay
:: The sum of the time spent decoding frames received.

Video encoding receiver stats include the following fields.  If not
present, that indicates the value has not changed since the last
value.

: encoding-id
:: The ID of the encoding for which the stats apply.

: cumulative-decoded-frames
:: The total number of video frames received and decoded.

: cumulative-lost-frames
:: The total number of video frames detected as lost.

: cumulative-buffer-delay
:: The sum of the time frames spent buffered between receipt and render.

: cumulative-decode-delay
:: The sum of the time spent decoding frames received.


Requests, Responses, and Watches {#requests-responses-watches}
===============================================================

Multiple sub-protocols in the Open Screen Protocol have messages that act as
requests, responses, watches, and events. Most requests have a `request-id`, and
the agent that receives the request must send exactly one reponse message in
return with the same `request-id`.  A watch request has a `watch-id`, and the
agent that receives the request may send any number of event messages in
response with the same `watch-id`, until the watch request expires.

`request-id` and `watch-id` values are unsigned integer IDs that are assigned
from a counter kept by each agent that starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each
ID.  Whenever an agent changes its `state-token`, it must reset its counter to 1.

When an agent sees that another agent has reset its state (by virtue of
advertising a new `state-token`), it should discard any requests, responses,
watches and events for that agent.

Other IDs that must be unique and would cause confusion if one side
loses state, such as `streaming-session-id`, `media-session-id`, and `encoding-id`
should be treated the same.

Note: Request and watch IDs are not tied to any particular QUIC connection
between agents.  If a QUIC connection is closed, an agent should not discard
requests, responses, watches, or events related to the other party.  This allows
agents to save power by closing unused connections.

Note: Request and watch IDs are not unique across agents.  An agent can combine
a request ID with a unique identifier for the agent that sent it (like its
certificate fingerprint) to track requests across multiple agents.

Protocol Extensions {#protocol-extensions}
===================

[=Open Screen Protocol agents=] may exchange extension messages that are not
defined by this specification.  This could be used for experimentation,
customization or other purposes.

To add new extension messages, extension authors must register a capability ID
with a range of message type keys in a
[public registry](https://w3c.github.io/openscreenprotocol/capabilites.md).
Agents may then indicate that they accept an extension by including the
corresponding capability ID in the `capabilities` field of its [=agent-info=]
message.

Capability IDs 1-999 are reserved for use by the Open Screen Protocol.
Capability IDs 1000 and above are available for extensions.  See [[#appendix-b]]
for legal ranges for extension message type keys.

Note: The purpose of the public registry is to prevent conflicts between
multiple extension authors' capability IDs and message type keys.

Agents must not send extension messages to another agent that has not advertised
the corresponding extension capability ID.

Note: See [[#messages]] for how agents handle unknown message type keys.

It is recommended that extension messages are also encoded in CBOR, to simplify
implementations and provide an easier path to standardization of extension
protocols.  However, this is not required; agents that support non-CBOR
extensions must be able to decode QUIC streams that contain a mix of CBOR
messages and non-CBOR extension messages.

Protocol Extension Fields {#protocol-extension-fields}
-------------------------

It is legal for an agent to add additional, extension fields to any map-valued
CBOR message type defined by the Open Screen Protocol.  Extension fields must be
optional, and the Open Screen Protocol message must make sense both with and
without the field set.

Agents must not add extended fields to the [=audio-frame=] message directly.
Instead, they may add them to its nested `optional` value.

Extension fields should use string keys to avoid conflicts with integer keys in
Open Screen Protocol messages.  An agent should not send extension fields to
another agent unless that agent advertises an extension capability ID in its
[=agent-info=] that indicates that it understands the extension fields.

Security and Privacy {#security-privacy}
====================

The Open Screen Protocol allows two [=OSP agents=] to discover each other and
exchange user and application data.  As such, its security and privacy
considerations should be closely examined.  We first evaluate the protocol
itself using the W3C [[SECURITY-PRIVACY-QUESTIONNAIRE|Security and Privacy
Questionnaire]].  We then examine whether the security and privacy guidelines
recommended by the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] and the
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] are met.  Finally we discuss recommended
mitigations that agents can use to meet these security and privacy requirements.

Threat Models {#threat-models}
--------------------------------

### Passive Network Attackers ### {#passive-network-attackers}

The Open Screen Protocol should assume that all parties that are connected to
the same LAN, either through a wired connection or through WiFi, are able to
observe all data flowing between OSP agents.

These parties will be able collect any data exposed through unencrypted
messages, such as mDNS records and the QUIC handshakes.

These parties may attempt to learn cryptographic parameters by observing data
flows on the QUIC connection, or by observing cryptographic timing.

### Active Network Attackers ### {#active-network-attackers}

Active attackers, such as compromised routers, will be able to manipulate data
exchanged between agents.  They can inject traffic into existing QUIC
connections and attempt to initiate new QUIC connections.  These abilities can
be used to attempt the following:

*   Impersonate an agent or one already authenticated by the user, in an attempt
    to convince the user to authenticate to it.
*   Connect to an agent and query its capabilities.
*   Connect to and control a presentation or remote playback, or extract data
    from the application state of the presentation or remote playback.

One particular attack of concern is misconfigured or compromised routers that
expose local network devices (such as OSP agents) to the Internet.  This vector
of attack has been used by malicious parties to take control of printers and
smart TVs by connecting to local network services that would normally be
inaccessible from the Internet.

### Denial of Service ### {#denial-of-service}

Parties with connected to the LAN may attempt to deny access to OSP agents.  For
example, an attacker my attempt to open a large number of QUIC connections to an
agent in an attempt to block legitimate connections or exhaust the agent's
system resources.  They may also multicast spurious DNS-SD records in an attempt
to exhaust the cache capacity for mDNS listeners, or to get listeners to open a
large number of bogus QUIC connections.

### Same-Origin Policy Violations ### {#same-origin-policy-violations}

The Presentation API allows cross-origin communication between controlling pages
and presentations with the consent of each origin (through their use of the
API).  This is similar to cross-origin communication via
{{Window/postMessage(message, targetOrigin, transfer)|postMessage()}} with a
`targetOrigin` of `*`.  However, the Presentation API does not convey source
origin information with each message.  Therefore, the Open Screen Protocol does
not convey origin information between its agents.

The [=presentation ID=] carries some protection against unrestricted
cross-origin access; but, rigorous authentication of the parties connected by a
{{PresentationConnection}} must be done at the application level.

Open Screen Protocol Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-privacy-questions}
-----------------------------------

### Personally Identifiable Information & High-Value Data ### {#personally-identifiable-information}

The following data exchanged by the protocol can be personally identifiable
and/or high value data:

1. Presentation URLs and availability results
1. Presentation IDs
1. Presentation connection IDs
1. Presentation connection messages
1. Remote playback URLs
1. Remote playback commands and status messages

Presentation IDs are considered high value data because they can be used in
conjunction with a Presentation URL to connect to a running presentation.

Presentation display names, model names, and capabilities, while not
considered personally identifiable, are important to protect to prevent an
attacker from changing them or substituting other values during the discovery
and authentication process.

The following data cannot be reasonably made confidential and should be
considered public:

1. IP addresses and ports used by the Open Screen Protocol.
1. Data advertised through mDNS, including the display name prefix, the
    certificate fingerprint, and the metadata version.
1. Data provided by an agent through [=agent-info=], including its
    [=display name=], its device model name, its capabilities, and its
    preferred locales.

### Cross Origin State Considerations ### {#cross-origin-state}

Access to origin state across browsing sessions is possible through the
Presentation API by reconnecting to a presentation that was started by a
previous session. This scenario is addressed in
[[PRESENTATION-API#cross-origin-access]].

Receiver availability is available cross-origin depending on the user's network
context.  Exposure of this data to the Web is also discussed in
[[PRESENTATION-API#personally-identifiable-information]] and
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#personally-identifiable-information]].

### Origin Access to Other Devices ### {#origin-access-devices}

By design, the Open Screen Protocol allows access to receivers from the Web.  By
implementing the protocol, these devices are knowingly making themselves
available to the Web and should be designed accordingly.

Below, we discuss mitigation steps to prevent malicious use of these devices.

### Incognito Mode ### {#incognito-mode}

The Open Screen Protocol does not distinguish between the user agent's normal
browsing and incognito modes, and agents that follow the specification
behave identically regardless of which mode is in use.

It's recommended that user agents use separate authentication contexts and QUIC
connections for normal and incognito profiles from the same user agent instance.
This prevents OSP agents from correlating activity among profiles
belonging to the same user (both normal and incognito).

### Persistent State ### {#persistent-state}

An agent is likely to persist the identity of agents that have successfully
completed [[#authentication]].  This may include the public key fingerprints,
metadata versions, and metadata for those parties.

However, this data is not normally exposed to the Web, only through the native
UI of the user agent during the display selection or display authentication
process.  It can be an implementation choice whether the user agent clears or
retains this data when the user clears browsing data.

Issue(132): Fate of metadata / authentication history when clearing browsing data.

### Other Considerations ### {#other-considerations}

The Open Screen Protocol does not grant to the Web additional access to the
following:

* New script loading mechanisms
* Access to the user's location
* Access to device sensors
* Access to the user's local computing environment
* Control over the user agent's native UI
* Security characteristics of the user agent

Presentation API Considerations {#presentation-api-considerations}
-------------------------------

[[PRESENTATION-API#security-and-privacy-considerations]] place these
requirements on the Open Screen Protocol:

1.  Presentation URLs and presentation IDs should remain private among the
    parties that are allowed to connect to a presentation, per the
    cross-origin access guidelines.
1.  Controllers and receivers should be notified when connections representing
    multiple user agent profiles have been made to a presentation, per the user
    interface guidelines.
1.  Messaging between controllers and receivers should be authenticated and
    confidential, per the guidelines for messaging between presentation
    connections.

The Open Screen Protocol addresses these considerations by:

1. Requiring mutual authentication and a TLS-secured QUIC connection before
     presentation URLs, IDs, or messages are exchanged.
1. Adding explicit messages and connection IDs for individual
     {{PresentationConnection|PresentationConnections}} so that agents can track
     the number of active connections.

Remote Playback API Considerations {#remote-playback-considerations}
----------------------------------

The [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK#security-and-privacy-considerations]] also state that
messaging between controllers and receivers should also be authenticated and
confidential.

This consideration is handled by requiring mutual authentication and a
TLS-secured QUIC connection before any remote playback related messages are
exchanged.

Mitigation Strategies {#security-mitigations}
--------------------------------------------

### Local passive network attackers ### {#local-passive-mitigations}

Local passive attackers may attempt to harvest data about user activities and
device capabilities using the Open Screen Protocol.  The main strategy to address
this is data minimization, by only exposing opaque public key fingerprints
before user-mediated authentication takes place.

Passive attackers may also attempt timing attacks to learn the cryptographic
parameters of the TLS 1.3 QUIC connection.  The application profile for TLS 1.3
mandates constant-time ciphers and TLS 1.3 implementations should use elliptic
curve signing operations that are resistant to side channel attacks.

### Local active network attackers ### {#local-active-mitigations}

Local active attackers may attempt to impersonate a presentation display the
user would normally trust.  The [[#authentication]] step of the Open Screen
Protocol prevents a man-in-the-middle from impersonating an agent, without
knowledge of a shared secret.  However, it is possible for an attacker to
impersonate an existing, trusted agent or a newly discovered agent that is not
yet authenticated and try to convince the user to authenticate to it.  (Trust in
this context means that a user has completed [[#authentication]] from their
agent to another agent.)

This can be addressed through a combination of techniques.  The first is
detecting attempts at impersonation.  Agents should detect the following
situations and flag an agent that meets any of the criteria as a <dfn>suspicious
agent</dfn>:

* Agents with distinct IP endpoints whose public key fingerprints collide during
    concurrent advertisement.
* Untrusted agents whose display name differs from the one previously
    advertised under a given public key fingerprint.
* Untrusted agents that fail the authentication challenge a certain number of times.
* Untrusted agents that advertise a display name that is similar to that from an
    already-trusted agent.
* Already-trusted agents whose metadata provided through the [=agent-info=]
    message has changed.

The second is through management of the low-entropy secret during mutual
authentication:

* Rotate the low-entropy secret to prevent brute force attacks.
* Use an increasing backoff to respond to authentication challenges, also to
    prevent brute force attacks.
* Use a cryptographically sound source of entropy to generate the shared secret.

The active attacker may also attempt to disrupt data exchanged over the QUIC
connection by injecting or modifying traffic.  These attacks should be mitigated
by a correct implementation of TLS 1.3.  See Appendix E of [[RFC846]] for a
detailed security analysis of the TLS 1.3 protocol.

### Remote active network attackers ### {#remote-active-mitigations}

Unfortunately, we cannot rely on network devices to fully protect OSP agents,
because a misconfigured firewall or NAT could expose a LAN-connected agent to
the broader Internet.  OSP agents should be secure against attack from any
Internet host.

Advertising agents must set the `at` field in their mDNS TXT record to protect
themselves from off-LAN attempts to initiate [[#authentication]], which result
in user annoyance (display or input of PSK) and potential brute force attacks
against the PSK.

### Denial of service ### {#denial-of-service-mitigations}

It will be difficult to completely prevent denial service of attacks that
originate on the user's local area network.  OSP agents can refuse new
connections, close connections that receive too many messages, or limit the
number of mDNS records cached from a specific responder in an attempt to allow
existing activities to continue in spite of such an attack.

### Malicious input ### {#malicious-input-mitigations}

OSP agents should be robust against malicious input that attempts to compromise
the target device by exploiting parsing vulnerabilities.

CBOR is intended to be less vulnerable to such attacks relative to alternatives
like JSON and XML.  Still, agents should be thoroughly tested using approaches
like [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).

Where possible, OSP agents (including the content rendering components) should
use defense-in-depth techniques like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxing</a>
to prevent vulnerabilities from gaining access to user data or leading to
persistent exploits.

User Interface Considerations {#security-ui}
-----------------------------

This specification does not make any specific requirements of the security
relevant user interfaces of OSP agents.  However there are important
considerations when designing these user interfaces, as PSK-based authentication
requires users to make informed decisions about which agents to trust.

1. Before an agent has authenticated another device, the agent should make it
    clear that any `agent-info` or other data from that device has not been
    verified by authentication.  (See below for how this applies to DNS-SD
    Instance Names.)
1. A [=suspicious agent=] should be displayed differently from trusted
    agents that are not suspicious, or not displayed at all.
1. The user interface to present a PSK during authentication should be done in
    trusted UI and be difficult to spoof.  It should be clear to the user which
    physical device is presenting the PSK.
1. The user interface to input a PSK during authentication should be done in
    trusted UI and be difficult to spoof.
1. The user should be required to take action to input the PSK, to prevent the
    user from blindly clicking through this step.
1. The user interfaces to render and input a PSK should meet accessibility
    guidelines.

### Instance and Display Names  ### {#instance-names}

Because DNS-SD [=Instance Names=] are the primary information that the user
sees prior to authentication, careful presentation of these names is necessary.

Agents must treat Instance Names as unverified information, and should check
that the Instance Name is a prefix of the display name received through the
[=agent-info=] message after a successful QUIC connection.  Once an agent has done
this check, it can show the name as a <dfn noexport>verified display name</dfn>.

Agents should show only complete display names to the user, instead of truncated
display names from DNS-SD.  A truncated display name should be verified as above
before being shown in full as a [=verified display name=].

<div class="note">
This means there are three categories of display names that agents should be
capable of handling:
<ol>
  <li>Truncated and unverified DNS-SD Instance Names, which should not be shown to the user.</li>
  <li>Complete but unverified DNS-SD Instance Names, which can be shown as
     unverified prior to [[#authentication]].</li>
  <li>Verified display names.</li>
</ol>
</div>

Appendix A: Messages {#appendix-a}
====================

The following messages are defined using the [=Concise Data Definition
Language=] syntax. When integer keys are used, a comment is appended to the line
to indicate the name of the field. Object definitions in this specification have
this unusual syntax to reduce the number of bytes-on-the-wire, while maintaining
a human-readable name for each key. Integer keys are used instead of object
arrays to allow for easy indexing of optional fields.

Each root message (one that can be put into a QUIC stream without being enclosed
by another message) has a comment indicating the message type key.

Smaller numbers should be reserved for message that will be sent more frequently
or are very small or both and larger numbers should be reserved for messages
that are infrequently sent or large or both because smaller type keys encode on
the wire smaller.

Appendix B: Message Type Key Ranges {#appendix-b}
===================================

The following appendix describes how the range of message type keys is divided.
Legal values are 1 to 2<sup>64</sup>.

Each type key is encoded as a variable-length integer on the wire of 1, 2, 4 or
8 bytes.  For each wire byte size, 1/4 to 1/2 of the keys are available for
extensions.

| Bytes | Range           | Purpose                      |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| 1     | 1 - 48          | Open Screen Protocol         |
| 1     | 49 - 63         | Available for extensions     |
| 2     | 64 - 8,192      | Open Screen Protocol         |
| 2     | 8,193 - 16,383  | Available for extensions     |
| 4     | 16,384 - 2^29   | Reserved for future use      |
| 4     | 2^29+1 - 2^30-1 | Available for extensions     |
| 8     | >= 2^30         | Reserved for future use      |
