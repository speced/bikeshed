<h2 id="secintro">Introduction</h2>

	<i>This section is non-normative.</i>

	This specification defines how the system clipboard is exposed to web applications.

	There are two general APIs described in this specification:

	* Clipboard Event API - This API provides a way to hook into the common clipboard
		operations of cutting, copying and pasting so that web application can
		adjust the clipboard data as required.

	* Async Clipboard API - This API provides direct access to read and write the
		clipboard data. Since this is considered to be a <a>powerful feature</a>,
		access to this API is controlled by a permission.

<h2 id="Cases">Use Cases</h2>

	<i>This section is non-normative.</i>

	<h3 id="change-default-clipboard-ops">Changing Default Clipboard Operations</h3>

		There are many scenarios where it is desireable to change the default clipboard
		operations (cut/copy/paste). Here are a few examples:

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Metadata</strong>
			When copying text from a repository of documents, it can be useful for the
			copied text to include metadata about the source of the copied content.

			<li><strong>Rich content editing</strong>
			When copying text which contains hyperlinks or other structure,
			it is often useful to be able to reformat the content to preserve
			important information.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Graphics with built-in semantics</strong>
			In order to make web applications which allow the manipulation of rich
			text, or of graphic content such as [[SVG11]], it is useful to provide a
			mechanism that allows for copying more than just the rendered content.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Mathematical information</strong>
			With content such as mathematics, simply copying rendered text and pasting
			it into another application generally leads to most of the semantics being
			lost. MathML often needs to be transformed to be copied as plain text, for
			example to make sure "to the power of" is shown with the caret "^" sign
			in a formula plain-text input. The XML source could also be placed in the
			clipboard with the appropriate transformation occurring at paste time.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="remote-clipboard-sync">Remote Clipboard Synchronization</h3>

		For web applications that communicate with remote devices (e.g., remote access
		or remote shell applications), there is often a need for the clipboard data
		to be kept in sync between the two devices.

		One important aspect of this use case is that it requires access to the
		clipboard in the absense of a user gesture or interaction.

		<div class="example">
		To copy the clipboard data from a remote device to the local clipboard, a web
		application would take the remote clipboard data and then {{Clipboard/write()}}
		the data to the local clipboard.
		</div>

		<div class="example">
		To copy the local clipboard data to a remote device, a web application would
		listen for [=clipboardchange=] events, {{Clipboard/read()}} from the clipboard
		whenever it is updated, and then send the new clipboard data to the remote device.
		</div>

	<h3 id="trigger-clipboard-actions">Trigger Clipboard Actions</h3>

		Applications that provide an alternate interface to a user agent sometimes need
		to be able to trigger clipboard actions in the user agent.

		As an example, consider a screen reader application that provides a more accessible
		interface to a standard web browser. While the reader can display content and
		allow the user to interact with it, actions like clipboard copy need
		to occur in the underlying browser to ensure that the clipboard content is set
		correctly (with any metadata added by the browser during copy).

<h2 id="terminolofy">Terminology</h2>

	The term <dfn>editable context</dfn> means any element that is either an
	[=editing host=], a textarea element, or an input element with its type
	attribute set to any of "text", "search", "tel",
	"url", "email", "password" or "number".


<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

	The platform provides a <dfn>system clipboard</dfn>.

	The [=system clipboard=] has a list of clipboard items that are collectively
	called the <dfn>system clipboard data</dfn>.

	* For the [[#clipboard-event-api]], the [=system clipboard data=] is
		exposed as a {{DataTransfer}} object that mirrors the contents of the clipboard.

	* For the [[#async-clipboard-api]], the [=system clipboard data=] is
		exposed as a sequence of [=/clipboard item=] objects that mirrors the contents of
		the clipboard.

<h2 id="clipboard-events-and-interfaces">Clipboard Events</h2>

	<h3 id="clipboard-event-interfaces">Clipboard event interfaces</h3>

		The ClipboardEvent interface extends the {{Event}} interface.

		<div id="clipboardeventinit-idl">

		<pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
		dictionary ClipboardEventInit : EventInit {
		  DataTransfer? clipboardData = null;
		};
		</pre>

		: <dfn for="ClipboardEventInit" data-export>clipboardData</dfn>
		:: A {{DataTransfer}} object to hold data and meta data related to the event.

		</div>
		<div id="clipboardevent-idl">

		<pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
		[Exposed=Window]
		interface ClipboardEvent : Event {
		  constructor(DOMString type, optional ClipboardEventInit eventInitDict = {});
		  readonly attribute DataTransfer? clipboardData;
		};
		</pre>

		: <dfn for="ClipboardEvent" data-export>clipboardData</dfn>

		:: The clipboardData attribute is an instance of the {{DataTransfer}}
			interface which lets a script read and manipulate values on the system
			clipboard during user-initiated copy, cut and paste operations. The
			associated drag data store is a live but filtered view of the system
			clipboard, exposing [=mandatory data types=] the implementation knows
			the script can safely access. For synthetic events, the drag data store
			contains the data added by the script that created the event.
		:: The clipboardData object's {{DataTransfer/items}} and
			{{DataTransfer/files}} properties enable processing of multi-part or
			non-textual data from the clipboard.

		</div>

		The interface can be used to <a lt="constructing events">construct events</a>.
		An example is given below:

		<pre class="example javascript">
			var pasteEvent = new ClipboardEvent('paste');
			pasteEvent.clipboardData.items.add('My string', 'text/plain');
			document.dispatchEvent(pasteEvent);
		</pre>

		Note: Synthetic clipboard events will not actually modify the clipboard or
		the document. In other words, while the script above will fire a paste event,
		the data will not be pasted into the document.

		<!-- Issue: There should be a way a script can check if a clipboard format
		is registered and whether the implementation allows writing this format to
		the clipboard! event.clipboardData.isTypeSupported('mime/type')</em>?
		-->

	<h3 id="clipboard-event-definitions">Clipboard events</h3>

		<h4 id="clipboard-event-clipboardchange">The <dfn>clipboardchange</dfn> event</h4>

			The [=clipboardchange=] event fires whenever the contents of the
			[=system clipboard=] are changed. These changes could be due to any of the
			following (non-exhaustive):

			* User-initiated cut or copy actions
			* Scripts that use the [[#async-clipboard-api]] to write to the clipboard
			* Actions that update the clipboard outside the user agent

			If the clipboard contents are changed outside the user agent, then the
			[=clipboardchange=] event MUST fire when the user agent regains focus.

			Since synthetic [=cut=] and [=copy=] events do not update the [=system clipboard=],
			they will not trigger a "clipboardchange" event.

		<h4 id="clipboard-event-copy">The <dfn>copy</dfn> event</h4>

			When the user initiates a copy action, the user agent
			[=fire a clipboard event|fires a clipboard event=] named
			[=copy=].

			If the event is not canceled, the currently selected
			data will be copied to the [=system clipboard=].
			The current document selection is not affected.

			The [=copy=] event bubbles, is cancelable, and is composed.

			See [[#copy-action]] for a detailed description of the processing model for
			this event.

			A synthetic [=copy=] event can be manually constructed and dispatched, but it
			will not affect the contents of the [=system clipboard=].

		<h4 id="clipboard-event-cut">The <dfn>cut</dfn> event</h4>

			When the user initiates a cut action, the user agent
			[=fire a clipboard event|fires a clipboard event=] named
			[=cut=].

			In an [=editable context=], if the event is not
			canceled the action will place the currently selected data on the
			[=system clipboard=] and remove the selection from the document.
			The [=cut=] event fires before the selected data is removed. When
			the cut operation is completed, the selection is collapsed.

			In a non-[=editable context=], the {{ClipboardEvent/clipboardData}} will
			be an empty list. Note that the [=cut=] event will still be fired
			in this case.

			The [=cut=] event bubbles, is cancelable, and is composed.

			See [[#cut-action]] for a detailed description of the processing model for
			this event.

			A synthetic [=cut=] event can be manually constructed and dispatched, but it
			will not affect the contents of the document or of the [=system clipboard=].

		<h4 id="clipboard-event-paste">The <dfn>paste</dfn> event</h4>

			When a user initiates a paste action, the user agent
			[=fire a clipboard event|fires a clipboard event=] named
			[=paste=]. The event fires before any clipboard data is inserted
			into the document.

			If the cursor is in an [=editable context=], the paste action will
			insert clipboard data in the most suitable format (if any) supported
			for the given context.

			The paste action has no effect in a non-[=editable context=],
			but the [=paste=] event fires regardless.

			The [=paste=] event bubbles, is cancelable, and is composed.

			See [[#paste-action]] for a detailed description of the processing model for
			this event.

			A synthetic [=paste=] event can be manually constructed and dispatched, but it
			will not affect the contents of the document.

	<h3 id="integration-with-other-scripts-and-events">Integration with other scripts and events</h3>

		<h4 id="allow-modify-clipboard">Event handlers that are <dfn export>allowed to modify the clipboard</dfn></h4>

			Event handlers may write to the clipboard if any of the following is
			true:

			* The action which triggers the event is invoked from the user-agent's
				own user interface, e.g. from a "Copy" menu entry or shortcut key.
			* The action which triggers the event is invoked from a scripting thread
				which is [=allowed to show a popup=].

			The implementation <em>may</em> allow other trusted event types to
			modify the clipboard if the implementation authors believe that those
			event types are likely to express user intention. The implementation
			<em>may</em> also support configuration that trusts specific sites or
			apps to modify the clipboard regardless of the origin of the scripting
			thread.

			Synthetic [=cut=] and [=copy=] events <em>must not</em> modify data on the
			system clipboard.

		<h4 id="allow-read-clipboard">Event handlers that are <dfn>allowed to read from clipboard</dfn></h4>

			Event handlers may read data from the system clipboard if either of the
			following is true

			* The action that triggers the event is invoked from the user-agent's
				own user interface, e.g. a "Paste" menu entry or shortcut key.
			* The script that triggers the action is running on a site which through
				an implementation-dependant mechanism is given permission to read
				data from the clipboard.
			* The action that triggers the event is triggered in an app with
				permissions to read the clipboard.

			Synthetic [=paste=] events <em>must not</em> give a script access to data on
			the real system clipboard.

		<h4 id="integration-with-rich-text-editing">Integration with rich text editing APIs</h4>

			If an implementation supports ways to execute clipboard commands through
			scripting, for example by calling the
			<code>document.execCommand()</code> method with the commands "cut",
			"copy" and "paste", the implementation <em>must</em> trigger the
			corresponding action, which again will dispatch the associated clipboard
			event.

			These are the steps to follow when triggering copy, cut or paste actions
			through a scripting API:

			1. Execute the corresponding action synchronously.
			1. Use the action's return value as the return value for the API call.

			Note: Copy and cut commands triggered through a scripting API will only
			affect the contents of the real clipboard if the event is dispatched
			from an event that is trusted and triggered by the user, or if the
			implementation is configured to allow this. Paste commands triggered
			through a scripting API will only fire paste events and give access to
			clipboard contents if the implementation is configured to allow this.
			How implementations can be configured to allow read or write access to
			the clipboard is outside the scope of this specification.

		<h4 id="otherevents">Interaction with other events</h4>

			If the clipboard operation is triggered by keyboard input, the
			implementation <em>must</em> fire the corresponding event that initiates
			the clipboard operation. The event is asynchronous but <em>must</em> be
			dispatched before <b>keyup</b> events for the relevant keys.

			The cut and paste actions <em>may</em> cause the implementation to
			dispatch other supported events, such as textInput, input, change,
			validation events, DOMCharacterDataModified and DOMNodeRemoved /
			DOMNodeInserted. Any such events are queued up to fire after processing
			of the cut/paste event is finished.

			The implementation <em>must not</em> dispatch other input-related events
			like textInput, input, change, and validation events in response to the
			copy operation.

		<h4 id="selection-mod">Event listeners that modify selection or focus</h4>

			If the event listener modifies the selection or [=focusable area=], the clipboard
			action <em>must</em> be completed on the modified selection.

<h2 id="clipboard-event-api">Clipboard Event API</h2>

	The Clipboard Event API allows you to override the default cut, copy
	and paste behavior of the user agent.

	Access to the clipboard is performed using the standard
	{{DataTransfer}} methods to mutate the {{DataTransfer/items}} on a
	{{ClipboardEvent}}'s {{ClipboardEvent/clipboardData}} attribute.
	One consequence of this is that these clipboard APIs can only
	access clipboard data in the context of a {{ClipboardEvent}} handler.

	Note: If you need to access the clipboard outside of a clipboard event
	handler, see [[#async-clipboard-api]].

	Note: The Clipboard Event APIs are synchronous, so they are limited in what they can
	do. Actions which are potentially blocking (like asking for permission or
	transcoding a image) are not supported by these APIs. See [[#async-clipboard-api]]
	for a more powerful API that can support blocking or other time-consuming
	actions.

	<h3 id="override-copy">Overriding the copy event</h3>

		To override the default [=copy=] event behavior, a [=copy=] event
		handler must be added and this event handler must call
		{{Event/preventDefault()}} to cancel the event.

		Canceling the event is required in order for the [=system clipboard=] to be
		updated with the data in {{ClipboardEvent/clipboardData}}.
		If the {{ClipboardEvent}} is not canceled, then the data from the
		current document selection will be copied instead.

		<pre class="example javascript">
		// Overwrite what is being copied to the clipboard.
		document.addEventListener('copy', function(e) {
			// e.clipboardData is initially empty, but we can set it to the
			// data that we want copied onto the clipboard.
			e.clipboardData.setData('text/plain', 'Hello, world!');
			e.clipboardData.setData('text/html', '&lt;b&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/b&gt;');

			// This is necessary to prevent the current document selection from
			// being written to the clipboard.
			e.preventDefault();
		});
		</pre>

	<h3 id="override-cut">Overriding the cut event</h3>

		To override the default [=cut=] event behavior, a [=cut=] event
		handler must be added and this event handler must call
		{{Event/preventDefault()}} to cancel the event.

		Canceling the event is required in order for the [=system clipboard=] to be
		updated with the data in {{ClipboardEvent/clipboardData}}.
		If the {{ClipboardEvent}} is not canceled, then the data from the
		current document selection will be copied instead.

		Note that canceling the [=cut=] event will also prevent the document from
		being updated (i.e., the current selection will not be removed). The event
		handler will need to manually update the document to remove the currently
		selected text.

		<pre class="example javascript">
		// Overwrite what is copied to the clipboard.
		document.addEventListener('cut', function(e) {
			// e.clipboardData is initially empty, but we can set it to the
			// data that we want copied onto the clipboard as part of the cut.
			// Write the data that we want copied onto the clipboard.
			e.clipboardData.setData('text/plain', 'Hello, world!');
			e.clipboardData.setData('text/html', '&lt;b&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/b&gt;');

			// Since we will be canceling the cut operation, we need to manually
			// update the document to remove the currently selected text.
			deleteCurrentDocumentSelection();

			// This is necessary to prevent the document selection from being
			// written to the clipboard.
			e.preventDefault();
		});
		</pre>

	<h3 id="override-paste">Overriding the paste event</h3>

		To override the default [=paste=] event behavior, a [=paste=] event
		handler must be added and this event handler must call
		{{Event/preventDefault()}} to cancel the event.

		Canceling the event is required so that the user agent does not update the
		document with data from the [=system clipboard=].

		Note that canceling the [=paste=] event will also prevent the document from
		being updated (i.e., nothing will be pasted into the document). The event
		handler will need to manually paste the data into the document.

		Also note that, when pasting, the [=drag data store mode=] flag is
		<a lt="concept dnd ro">read-only</a>, hence calling {{DataTransfer/setData()}} from a
		[=paste=] event handler will not modify the data that is
		inserted, and not modify the data on the clipboard.

		<pre class="example javascript">
		// Overwrite what is being pasted onto the clipboard.
		document.addEventListener('paste', function(e) {
			// e.clipboardData contains the data that is about to be pasted.
			if (e.clipboardData.types.indexOf('text/html') > -1) {
				var oldData = e.clipboardData.getData('text/html');
				var newData = '&lt;b&gt;Ha Ha!&lt;/b&gt; ' + oldData;

				// Since we are canceling the paste operation, we need to manually
				// paste the data into the document.
				pasteClipboardData(newData);

				// This is necessary to prevent the default paste action.
				e.preventDefault();
			}
		});
		</pre>

	<h3 id="mandatory-data-types-x"><dfn>Mandatory data types</dfn></h3>

		The implementation must recognise the native OS clipboard format description
		for the following data types, to be able to populate the
		{{DataTransferItemList}} with the correct description for paste events, and
		set the correct data format on the OS clipboard in response to copy and cut
		events.

		<h4 id="reading-from-clipboard">Reading from the clipboard</h4>

			These data types must be exposed by <em>paste</em> events if a
			corresponding native type exists on the clipboard:

			* text/plain
			* text/html
			* image/png

		<h4 id="writing-to-clipboard">Writing to the clipboard</h4>

			These data types must be placed on the clipboard with a corresponding
			native type description if added to a {{DataTransfer}} object during
			<em>copy</em> and <em>cut</em> events.

			* text/plain
			* text/html
			* image/png

			Advisement: Warning! The data types that untrusted scripts are allowed to write to the
			clipboard are limited as a security precaution. Untrusted scripts can
			attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in local software by placing
			data known to trigger those vulnerabilities on the clipboard.

		</dl>

		A <dfn>clipboard item</dfn> is conceptually data that the user has expressed a desire to make shareable by invoking a "cut" or "copy" command. A [=/clipboard item=] serves two purposes. First, it allows a website to read data copied by a user to the system clipboard. Second, it allows a website to write data to the system clipboard.

		<p class=note>
			For example, if a user copies a range of cells from a spreadsheet of a native application, it will result in one [=/clipboard item=]. If a user copies a set of files from their desktop, that list of files will be represented by multiple [=/clipboard item=]s.
		</p>

		Some platforms may support having more than one [=/clipboard item=] at a time on the [=clipboard=], while other platforms replace the previous [=/clipboard item=] with the new one.

		A [=/clipboard item=] has a <dfn>list of representations</dfn>, each <dfn>representation</dfn> with an associated <dfn for=representation>mime type</dfn> (a [=/MIME type=]) and <dfn for=representation>data</dfn> (a {{ClipboardItemData}}).

		<p class=note>
			In the example where the user copies a range of cells from a spreadsheet, it may be represented as an image (image/png), an HTML table (text/html), or plain text (text/plain).
		</p>

		Each of these [=/MIME type=]s describe a different [=representation=] of the same [=/clipboard item=] at different levels of fidelity and make the [=/clipboard item=] more consumable by target applications during paste.

		<p class=note>
			Making the range of cells available as an image will allow the user to paste the cells into a photo editing app, while the text/plain format can be used by text editor apps.
		</p>

		A [=/clipboard item=] has a <dfn>presentation style</dfn> (a {{PresentationStyle}}). It helps distinguish whether apps "pasting" a [=/clipboard item=] should insert the contents of an appropriate [=representation=] inline at the point of paste or if it should be treated as an attachment.

		Web apps that support pasting only a single [=/clipboard item=] should use the first [=/clipboard item=].

		<p class=note>
			{{Clipboard/write()}} chooses the last [=/clipboard item=].
		</p>

		Web apps that support pasting more than one [=/clipboard item=] could, for example, provide a user interface that previews the contents of each [=/clipboard item=] and allow the user to choose which one to paste.
		Further, apps are expected to enumerate the [=/MIME type=]s of the [=/clipboard item=] they are pasting and select the one best-suited for the app according to some app-specific algorithm.
		Alternatively, an app can present the user with options on how to paste a [=/clipboard item=], e.g. "paste as image" or "paste formatted text", etc.

		A {{ClipboardItem}} object has an associated <dfn for="ClipboardItem">clipboard item</dfn>, which is a [=/clipboard item=].

		A {{ClipboardItem}} object has an associated <dfn for="ClipboardItem">types array</dfn>, which is a {{FrozenArray}}&lt;{{DOMString}}&gt;.

		To <dfn>create a {{ClipboardItem}} object</dfn>, given a [=/clipboard item=] |clipboardItem| and a Realm |realm|, run these steps:
			1. Let |clipboardItemObject| be a [=new=] {{ClipboardItem}} with |realm|.

			1. Set |clipboardItemObject|'s [=/clipboard item=] to |clipboardItem|.

		The <dfn constructor for="ClipboardItem" lt="ClipboardItem(items, options)"><code>new ClipboardItem(<var>items</var>, <var>options</var>)</code></dfn> constructor steps are:
			1. If |items| is empty, then throw a {{TypeError}}.

			1. If |options| is empty, then set options["presentationStyle"] = "unspecified".

			1. Set [=this=]'s [=ClipboardItem/clipboard item=] to a new [=/clipboard item=].

			1. Set [=this=]'s [=ClipboardItem/clipboard item=]'s [=presentation style=] to |options|["{{ClipboardItemOptions/presentationStyle}}"].

			1. Let |types| be a list of {{DOMString}}.

			1. For each (|key|, |value|) in |items|:

				1. Let |mimeType| be the result of [=parsing a MIME type=] given |key|.

<h2 id="clipboard-actions">Clipboard Actions</h2>

	This section defines clipboard actions and the processing model
	for event dispatch.

	Each clipboard action has two flags called [=script-triggered=] and
	[=script-may-access-clipboard=].

	The <dfn>script-triggered</dfn> flag is set if the action runs because
	of a script, for example a <code>document.execCommand()</code> call.
	Future scripting APIs that interact with the clipboard should also use
	these actions, and the [=script-triggered=] flag must be set
	accordingly.

	<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="script-may-access-clipboard">

	The <dfn>script-may-access-clipboard</dfn> flag is set as follows:

	1. If action is <em>copy</em> or <em>cut</em> and the script thread
		is [=allowed to modify the clipboard=], then

		1. Set the action's [=script-may-access-clipboard=] flag

	1. If action is <em>paste</em> and the script thread is [=allowed to
		read from clipboard=], then

<h2 id="clipboard-permissions">Permissions API Integration</h2>

	The [[permissions]] API provides a uniform way for websites to access
	<a>powerful feature</a>s like the clipboard. It allows websites to request permissions
	from users and query which permissions they have.

	For the clipboard, one permission is defined:
	<dfn enum-value for="PermissionName">"clipboard-write"</dfn>

	Note: Clipboard permissions currently only apply to the Async Clipboard API.
	Future versions of this specification may be updated to apply this permission
	to other Clipboard interactions.

	These clipboard permissions are <a>powerful feature</a>s
	permission-related algorithms and types are defined as follows:

	: <a>permission descriptor type</a>
	::
		<pre class="idl">
			dictionary ClipboardPermissionDescriptor : PermissionDescriptor {
				boolean allowWithoutGesture = false;
			};
		</pre>

	There are 4 clipboard permissions:

	* { name: "clipboard-write", allowWithoutGesture: false }
	* { name: "clipboard-write", allowWithoutGesture: true }

	With the following relationships:

	* <code>{ "clipboard-write" + true }</code> is stronger than <code>{ "clipboard-write" + false }</code>

	While user agents MUST support the {{ClipboardPermissionDescriptor}} as described
	in this specification, they, of course, retain complete control over the default
	settings and how (or if) they are exposed to the user.

	<div class="example">
		A user agent that wants to have separate user-settable write controls over the clipboard
		and always require a user gesture would handle each descriptor as follows:

		* <code class="perm">{ "clipboard-write" + false }</code> is exposed for user control
		* <code class="perm">{ "clipboard-write" + true }</code> is always <a>denied</a>
	</div>

<h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

	Enabling authors to change what is copied by a user, or to make an automated
	copy of something that was never selected and allowing unrestricted calls to
	paste information can raise various security concerns.

	Some example scenarios include:

	* A user selects a link and copies it, but a different link is copied to the clipboard.
		The effect of this can range from an unexpected result on pasting to an attempted
		"phishing" attack.
	* (Self-XSS) Shell commands or executable script can be placed in the clipboard with the
		intent that the user will run the pasted content.
	* An image that is specially crafted to exploit bugs in the core OS image handling
		code can be written to the clipboard.

	<h3 id="pasting-html">Pasting HTML and multi-part data</h3>

		<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

		There are certain security risks associated with pasting formatted or
		multi-part data.

		* The user might paste hidden data without realising it is there. This may
			happen if, for example, the markup includes
			&lt;input type="hidden"&gt; tags or HTML comments. Such hidden data
			might contain sensitive information.
		* The user might paste malicious JavaScript into a trusted page.
		* The implementation might grant scripts access to local files the user
			did not intend to expose.

		To determine what policies to use, the factors we consider are:

		* The origin of the data being pasted
		* The origin of data sub-parts such as referenced images
		* The origin of the running script

		This is an overview of the scenarios and the possible security policies:

		<table class="simple">
			<tr>
				<th>Origin of data</th>
				<th>Origin of script</th>
				<th>Rules</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td rowspan="2">Originates from online source</td>
				<td>Same as data</td>
				<td>Do not sanitize HTML. Do not access any local files.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- cell span from previous row -->
				<td>Different origin</td>
				<td>Optionally sanitize content. Do not access any local files.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Originates from local application</td>
				<td>Any</td>
				<td>Do not sanitize HTML. Grant access to local files</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		Some implementations mitigate the risks associated with pasting rich
		text by stripping potentially malicious content such as SCRIPT elements
		and javascript: links by default when pasting rich text, but allow a
		paste event handler to retrieve and process the original, un-sanitized
		data.

	<h3 id="general-security-policies">General security policies</h3>

		The implementation <em>must not</em> download referenced online
		resources, or expose their contents in the {{DataTransfer/files}} list
		or {{DataTransferItemList}}.

		If the data on the clipboard is not from a local application, the
		implementation <em>must not</em> give access to any referenced local
		files. For example, if the data contains
		&lt;img src="file://localhost/example.jpg"&gt;
		but the data's origin is an online resource, the implementation must not
		add an entry for example.jpg to the clipboardData.items list.

	<h3 id="image-transcode">Transcoding images</h3>

		To prevent malicious image data from being placed on the clipboard, the image
		data may be transcoded to produce a safe version of the image. This prevents websites
		from trying to exploit security vulnerabilities in other applications.

		Implementations should not transcode images being read from the clipboard.
		Transcoding images can lose important metadata (such as the physical resolution
		of an image).
		This is also consistent with other methods in which images can be shared
		with a website (such as `&lt;input type=file&gt;`).

	<h3 id="nuisances">Nuisance considerations</h3>

		Scripts may use the {{DataTransfer}} API to annoy and confuse users by
		altering the data on the system clipboard from copy and cut events. This
		specification does not attempt to prevent such nuisances, though
		implementations may add additional restrictions.

		Implementations must handle scripts that try to place excessive amounts
		of data on the clipboard gracefully.


<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

	Because these APIs provide access to the user's clipboard data, there are serious
	privacy concerns due to the possibility that the clipboard will contain
	personally-identifiable information (PII) like names, addresses, or passwords.

	In general, user agents <em>must</em> ensure that untrusted scripts do not get
	uncontrolled access to a user's clipboard data through these APIs.

	<h3 id="privacy-events">Privacy and the Clipboard Event API</h3>

		The Clipboard Event API allows scripts running in the context of a clipboard
		event handler to access a copy of the system clipboard and potentially modify
		the data being written to the clipboard.

		User agents should be aware of the following requirements with regards to
		securing the data accessed by the Clipboard Event API:

		* Objects implementing the {{DataTransfer}} interface to return
			clipboard data <em>must not</em> be available outside the
			ClipboardEvent event handler that the data is provided to.
		* If a script stores a reference to an object implementing the
			{{DataTransfer}} interface to use from outside the ClipboardEvent
			event handler, all methods <em>must</em> be no-ops when called
			outside the expected context.
		* Implementations <em>must not</em> let scripts create synthetic
			clipboard events to get access to real clipboard data (unless the user
			has configured it to do so).

		Even though the Clipboard Event API is not covered by the Clipboard permission,
		user agents may choose to provide a method for the user to disable this API or
		to configure which sites are allowed to access it.

	<h3 id="privacy-async">Privacy and the Asychronous Clipboard API</h3>

		The Asynchronous Clipboard API is a powerful feature because it can allow access
		to the clipboard data from any script (access is not restricted to Clipboard Event
		handlers) and data can be accessed in the absence of a user provided gesture.

		To help prevent abuse, this API <em>must not</em> be available unless the script
		is executing in the context of a document that [=has focus steps|has focus=].

		<h4 id="privacy-permission">Privacy and Clipboard Permission</h4>

			The Clipboard Permission gates access to this API, but user agents get to choose
			the permission defaults and which of these permission settings can be set by the
			user. For example, a user agent may choose to only allow access to the
			Asynchronous Clipboard API when a user gesture is present and always deny script
			requests for access without a gesture.

			User agents may opt to have this permission automatically expire sometime after
			the user grants permission, for example, by having the permission expire:

			* After a set time from when the permission was first granted
			* After a set time from the user's last visit to a site
			* When the user navigates away from the page

	<h3 id="privacy-other">Other Privacy Concerns</h3>

		If the user agent allows clipboard data to be read using
		<code>document.execCommand("paste")</code> then the user agent <em>must</em>
		ensure that the user has explicitly allowed that access to take place.

		: Input
		:: |items|, a {{DataTransferItemList}} list of items to write
		:: |clear-was-called|, a boolean
		:: |types-to-clear|, a list

		: Output
		:: None

		1. If the |items| list is not empty, then

			1. Clear the clipboard

			1. For each part in the list,

				1. If data type is <i>text/plain</i>, then

					1. Ensure encoding is correct per OS and locale conventions

					1. Normalize line endings according to platform conventions

					1. Place text on clipboard with the appropriate OS clipboard
						format description

				1. Else, if data is of a type listed in the
					[=mandatory data types=] list, then

					1. Place part on clipboard with the appropriate OS clipboard
						format description

				1. Else

					1. This is left to the implementation...

						Issue: It's not good to leave things up to the
						implementation. What should happen here?

						Note: Due to limitations in the implementation of operating
						system clipboards, scripts should not assume that custom
						formats will be available to other applications on the
						system. For example, there is a limit to how many custom
						clipboard formats can be registered in Microsoft Windows.
						While it is possible to use any string for
						<a>setData()</a>'s type argument, sticking to the
						[=mandatory data types=] is strongly recommended.

		1. Else, the |items| list is empty. Follow these steps to determine
			whether to clear the clipboard:

			1. If the list of items is empty and the |clear-was-called|
				flag is <i>true</i>, then

				1. If the |types-to-clear| list is empty, then

					1. Clear the clipboard

				1. Else

					1. Remove types in the |types-to-clear| list from the
						clipboard in an operating system and implementation-specific
						way

						Issue: The "remove specific types from clipboard" feature is
						at risk. It doesn't seem all that important, and it's
						unclear if it can be implemented easily across relevant
						platforms.

			sequence numbers

		1. Let |trusted| be <em>true</em> if the event is generated by the
			user agent, <em>false</em> otherwise

		1. Let |target| be set as follows:

			1. If the context is editable, then

				1. Set |target| to be the element that contains the
					start of the visible selection or cursor in document order,
					or [=the body element=] if there is no visible selection or cursor.

			1. Else, if the context is not editable, then

				1. Set |target| to the focused node, or [=the body element=] if no node
					has focus.

		1. Process the event as follows:

			1. If |e| is "paste", then

				1. Set the |clipboard-event-data|'s
					internal [=drag data store mode=] flag to
					<a lt="concept dnd ro">read-only</a>.

				1. If |trusted| is <em>true</em>, or the
					implementation is configured to give script-generated events
					read access to the OS clipboard

					1. For each |clipboard-part| on the OS clipboard, carry out these steps:

						1. If |clipboard-part| contains plain text, then

							1. Ensure the text is in the encoding the
								scripting engine uses internally

							1. Let |new-data| be a new {{DataTransferItem}} with
								[=drag data item kind=] set to <em>string</em> and
								[=drag data item type string=] set to <em>text/plain</em>.

							1. Set |new-data|'s data to the plain text.

							1. Add |new-data| to |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}}

						1. If |clipboard-part| represents file
							references, then for each file reference:

							1. Determine MIME type of referenced file

							1. Let |new-data| be a new {{DataTransferItem}} with
								[=drag data item kind=] set to <em>file</em> and
								[=drag data item type string=] set to the
								corresponding MIME type, or
								<code>application/octet-stream</code> if the
								file's type is unknown.

							1. Set |new-data|'s data to the file reference data.

							1. Add |new-data| to |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}}

						1. If |clipboard-part| contains HTML- or
							XHTML-formatted text, according to the operating
							system's convention for describing such clipboard
							formats, then

							1. If the implementation supports pasting HTML, then
								the implementation <em>must</em> process the
								markup by calling [=process an html paste event=]
								with |clipboard-part| and |clipboard-event-data|.

						1. If |clipboard-part| contains data in
							another supported binary or text-based format (see
							[=mandatory data types=]), then

							1. Determine the MIME type of the data

							1. Let |new-data| be a new {{DataTransferItem}}
								with [=drag data item kind=] set to
								<em>file</em>, [=drag data item type string=]
								set to the corresponding MIME type

							1. Set |new-data|'s data to be the binary or text-based data.

							1. Add |new-data| to |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}}

				1. Update |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/files}} property to match
					entries in |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}}.

				1. Update |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/types}} property to match
					entries in |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}}.

			1. If |e| is "copy" or "cut", then

				1. Set the associated {{DataTransfer}} object's internal
					[=drag data store mode=] flag to <a lt="concept dnd rw">read/write</a>

		1. Set |e|'s {{ClipboardEvent/clipboardData}} to |clipboard-event-data|.

		1. Set |e|'s {{Event/isTrusted}} to |trusted|.

		1. Set |e|'s {{Event/composed}} to true.

		1. Dispatch the event |e| which bubbles and is cancelable, and which
			uses the {{ClipboardEvent}} interface, at |target|.

			Implementation requirements for access to data during event
			dispatch are defined in [[!HTML]]. Some additional clipboard
			event-specific processing rules are given below:

			Issue: Why here? Why not in the HTML spec?

			1. If a script calls <a>clearData()</a> or
				{{DataTransferItemList/clear()}} and the {{DataTransfer}}
				object's internal [=drag data store mode=] flag is
				<a lt="concept dnd rw">read/write</a>, then

				1. Set the |clear-was-called| flag to true. If an
					argument is given, add the argument to the
					|types-to-clear| list.

			1. If a script calls <a>setData()</a> or modifies items and the
				|clear-was-called| flag is true, then

				1. If the |types-to-clear| list is empty, then

					1. Set the |clear-was-called| flag to false, then

				1. Else, if <a>setData()</a>'s <code>type</code> argument or
					the new item's [=drag data item type string=] is
					found in the |types-to-clear| list, then

					1. Remove it from the list. If the list is now empty,
						set the |clear-was-called| flag to false.

			1. If a script calls <a>getData()</a> or accesses items in the
				{{DataTransferItemList}} and |clipboard-entry| is
				set, then

				1. Check that the clipboard data's sequence number matches
					|clipboard-entry|. If the clipboard no longer
					contains the same entry, set the {{DataTransferItemList}}
					object's internal [=drag data store mode=] to
					<a lt="concept dnd p">protected</a>.

			Advisement: Warning! A malicious script listening to a paste event may set
			up a never-ending loop in order to read what the user places on
			the clipboard in the future. On platforms where a clipboard
			sequence number is not available, other limitations should be
			implemented.

			Issue: Are these steps necessary? Do we know about native (platform)

			Issue: This feature is at risk because it's unclear whether it is
			required, and because it's hard to test in a cross-platform way.

			1. If |clipboard-event-data|'s {{DataTransfer/items}} already
