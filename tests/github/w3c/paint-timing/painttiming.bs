Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<div class=non-normative>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Load is not a single moment in time — it's an experience that no one metric can fully capture. There are multiple moments during the load experience that can affect whether a user perceives it as "fast" or "slow".

First paint (FP) is the first of these key moments, followed by first contentful paint (FCP). These metrics mark the points in time when the browser renders a given document. This is important to the user because it answers the question: is it happening?

The primary difference between the two metrics is FP marks the first time the browser renders anything for a given document. By contrast, FCP marks the time when the browser renders the first bit of image or text content from the DOM.

Usage example {#example}
------------------------

<pre class="example highlight">
    var observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {
        var perfEntries = list.getEntries();
        for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {
            // Process entries
            // report back for analytics and monitoring
            // ...
        }
    });

    // register observer for paint timing notifications
    observer.observe({entryTypes: ["paint"]});
</pre>

</div>

Terminology {#sec-terminology}
==============================

<dfn export>Paint</dfn>: the user agent has performed a "paint" (or "render") when it has converted the render tree to pixels on the screen.
Formally, we consider the user agent to have "rendered" a document when it has performed the [=update the rendering=] steps of the event loop.

    NOTE: The rendering pipeline is very complex, and the timestamp should be the latest timestamp the user agent is able to note in this pipeline (best effort). Typically the time at which the frame is submitted to the OS for display is recommended for this API.

<dfn export>First paint</dfn> entry contains a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} reporting the time when the user agent first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint and the enclosing box of an iframe. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the user agent has started to render the page.

<dfn export>First contentful paint</dfn> entry contains a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} reporting the time when the user agent first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This excludes any content of iframes, but includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.

Whenever a user agent preemptively paints content outside of the [=viewport=], those paints must be considered for [=first paint=] and [=first contentful paint=].

    NOTE: a user agent has freedom to choose their own strategy for painting. Such strategy could even be to never paint content that is outside of the viewport. Therefore, different user agents can have different behaviors for [=first paint=] and [=first contentful paint=] in edge cases where the only content occurs outside of the viewport.

The {{PerformancePaintTiming}} interface {#sec-PerformancePaintTiming}
=======================================

<pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window]
    interface PerformancePaintTiming : PerformanceEntry {};
</pre>

{{PerformancePaintTiming}} extends the following attributes of {{PerformanceEntry}} interface:

* The {{PerformanceEntry/name}} attribute's getter must return a {{DOMString}} for minimal frame attribution. Possible values of name are:
    * <code>"first-paint"</code>: for [=first paint=]
    * <code>"first-contentful-paint"</code>: for [=first contentful paint=]
* The {{PerformanceEntry/entryType}} attribute's getter must return <code>"paint"</code>.
* The {{PerformanceEntry/startTime}} attribute's getter must return a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} of when the paint occured.
* The {{PerformanceEntry/duration}} attribute's getter must return 0.

NOTE: A user agent implementing {{PerformancePaintTiming}} would need to include <code>"paint"</code> in {{PerformanceObserver/supportedEntryTypes}} for {{Window}} contexts.
This allows developers to detect support for paint timing.

Processing model {#sec-processing-model}
========================================

Reporting paint timing {#sec-reporting-paint-timing}
--------------------------------------------------------

<h4 dfn export>Mark paint timing</h4>

<div algorithm="Mark paint timing">
    When asked to [=mark paint timing=] given a [=Document=] |document| as input, perform the following steps:

    1. Let |paintTimestamp| be the [=current high resolution time=].
    1. If this instance of [=update the rendering=] is the [=first paint=] of |document|, then invoke the [[#report-paint-timing]] algorithm with |document|, <code>"first-paint"</code>, and |paintTimestamp|.

        NOTE: [=First paint=] excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint.

    1. If this instance of [=update the rendering=] is the [=first contentful paint=] of |document|, then invoke the [[#report-paint-timing]] algorithm with |document|, <code>"first-contentful-paint"</code>, and |paintTimestamp| as arguments.

        NOTE: This paint must include text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG.

        NOTE: A parent frame should not be aware of the paint events from its child iframes, and vice versa. This means that a frame that contains just iframes will have [=first paint=] (due to the enclosing boxes of the iframes) but no [=first contentful paint=].
</div>

<h4 dfn>Report paint timing</h4>

<div algorithm="Report paint timing">
    When asked to [=report paint timing=] given |document|, |paintType|, and |paintTimestamp| as arguments, perform the following steps:
    1. Create a <a spec=webidl>new</a> {{PerformancePaintTiming}} object |newEntry| with |document|'s [=relevant realm=] and set its attributes as follows:
        1. Set |newEntry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/name}} attribute to |paintType|.
        1. Set |newEntry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/entryType}} attribute to <code>"paint"</code>.
        1. Set |newEntry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/startTime}} attribute to |paintTimestamp|.
        1. Set |newEntry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/duration}} attribute to 0.
    1. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dfn-queue-a-performanceentry">Add the PerformanceEntry</a> |newEntry| object.
