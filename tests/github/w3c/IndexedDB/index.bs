Title: Indexed Database API 3.0
Shortname: IndexedDB
Abstract: This document defines APIs for a database of records holding
    simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key
    and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records
    it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate
    records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can
    be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a
    persistent B-tree data structure.

This is the Third Edition of Indexed Database API.
The [First Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-IndexedDB-20150108/),
simply titled "Indexed Database API",
became a W3C Recommendation on 8 January 2015.
The [Second Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-IndexedDB-2-20180130/),
titled "Indexed Database API 2.0",
became a W3C Recommendation on 30 January 2018.

Indexed Database API 3.0 is intended to supersede Indexed Database API 2.0.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Introduction # {#introduction}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in order to
satisfy off-line data requirements of Web applications. [[WEBSTORAGE]]
is useful for storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values.
However, it does not provide in-order retrieval of keys, efficient
searching over values, or storage of duplicate values for a key.

This specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced
key-value data management that is at the heart of most sophisticated
query processors. It does so by using transactional databases to store
keys and their corresponding values (one or more per key), and
providing a means of traversing keys in a deterministic order. This is
often implemented through the use of persistent B-tree data structures
that are considered efficient for insertion and deletion as well as
in-order traversal of very large numbers of data records.


<aside class=example id=example-open-connection>
The following example uses the API to access a `"library"` database. It has a `"books"` object store that holds books records stored by their `"isbn"` property as the primary key.

Book records have a `"title"` property. This example artificially requires that book titles are unique. The code enforces this by creating an index named `"by_title"` with the {{IDBIndexParameters/unique}} option set. This index is used to look up books by title, and will prevent adding books with non-unique titles.

Book records also have an `"author"` property, which is not <span class=allow-2119>required</span> to be unique. The code creates another index named `"by_author"` to allow look-ups by this property.

The code first opens a connection to the database. The <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a> event handler code creates the object store and indexes, if needed. The <a event for=IDBRequest>`success`</a> event handler code saves the opened connection for use in later examples.

```js
const request = indexedDB.open("library");
let db;

request.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // The database did not previously exist, so create object stores and indexes.
  const db = request.result;
  const store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
  const titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
  const authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");

  // Populate with initial data.
  store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
  store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
  store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result;
};
```

The following example populates the database using a transaction.

```js
const tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
const store = tx.objectStore("books");

store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});

tx.oncomplete = function() {
  // All requests have succeeded and the transaction has committed.
};
```

The following example looks up a single book in the database by title
using an index.

```js
const tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
const store = tx.objectStore("books");
const index = store.index("by_title");

const request = index.get("Bedrock Nights");
request.onsuccess = function() {
  const matching = request.result;
  if (matching !== undefined) {
    // A match was found.
    report(matching.isbn, matching.title, matching.author);
  } else {
    // No match was found.
    report(null);
  }
};
```

The following example looks up all books in the database by author
using an index and a cursor.

```js
const tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
const store = tx.objectStore("books");
const index = store.index("by_author");

const request = index.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.only("Fred"));
request.onsuccess = function() {
  const cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    // Called for each matching record.
    report(cursor.value.isbn, cursor.value.title, cursor.value.author);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    // No more matching records.
    report(null);
  }
};
```

The following example shows one way to handle errors when a request fails.

```js
const tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
const store = tx.objectStore("books");
const request = store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Slate", isbn: 987654});
request.onerror = function(event) {
  // The uniqueness constraint of the "by_title" index failed.
  report(request.error);
  // Could call event.preventDefault() to prevent the transaction from aborting.
};
tx.onabort = function() {
  // Otherwise the transaction will automatically abort due the failed request.
  report(tx.error);
};
```

The database connection can be closed when it is no longer needed.

```js
db.close();
```

In the future, the database might have grown to contain other object stores and indexes. The following example shows one way to handle migrating from an older version.

```js
const request = indexedDB.open("library", 3); // Request version 3.
let db;

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  const db = request.result;
  if (event.oldVersion < 1) {
    // Version 1 is the first version of the database.
    const store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
    const titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
    const authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion < 2) {
    // Version 2 introduces a new index of books by year.
    const bookStore = request.transaction.objectStore("books");
    const yearIndex = bookStore.createIndex("by_year", "year");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion < 3) {
    // Version 3 introduces a new object store for magazines with two indexes.
    const magazines = db.createObjectStore("magazines");
    const publisherIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_publisher", "publisher");
    const frequencyIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_frequency", "frequency");
  }
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result; // db.version will be 3.
};
```
</aside>

<aside class=example id=handling-versionchange>
A single database can be used by multiple clients (pages and workers)
simultaneously &mdash; transactions ensure they don't clash while reading and writing.
If a new client wants to upgrade the database (via the <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a>
event), it cannot do so until all other clients close their connection to the
current version of the database.

To avoid blocking a new client from upgrading, clients can listen for the
<a event for=IDBDatabase>`versionchange`</a> event. This fires when another client is wanting to upgrade the
database. To allow this to continue, react to the <a event for=IDBDatabase>`versionchange`</a> event by doing
something that ultimately closes this client's [=/connection=] to the database.

One way of doing this is to reload the page:

```js
db.onversionchange = function() {
  // First, save any unsaved data:
  saveUnsavedData().then(function() {
    // If the document isn't being actively used, it could be appropriate to reload
    // the page without the user's interaction.
    if (!document.hasFocus()) {
      location.reload();
      // Reloading will close the database, and also reload with the new JavaScript
      // and database definitions.
    } else {
      // If the document has focus, it can be too disruptive to reload the page.
      // Maybe ask the user to do it manually:
      displayMessage("Please reload this page for the latest version.");
    }
  });
};

function saveUnsavedData() {
  // How you do this depends on your app.
}

function displayMessage() {
  // Show a non-modal message to the user.
}
```

Another way is to call the [=/connection=]'s {{IDBDatabase/close()}} method. However, you need to make
sure your app is aware of this, as subsequent attempts to access the database
will fail.

```js
db.onversionchange = function() {
  saveUnsavedData().then(function() {
    db.close();
    stopUsingTheDatabase();
  });
};

function stopUsingTheDatabase() {
  // Put the app into a state where it no longer uses the database.
}
```

The new client (the one attempting the upgrade) can use the <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`blocked`</a> event to
detect if other clients are preventing the upgrade from happening. The <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`blocked`</a>
event fires if other clients still hold a connection to the database after their
<a event for=IDBDatabase>`versionchange`</a> events have fired.

```js
const request = indexedDB.open("library", 4); // Request version 4.
let blockedTimeout;

request.onblocked = function() {
  // Give the other clients time to save data asynchronously.
  blockedTimeout = setTimeout(function() {
    displayMessage("Upgrade blocked - Please close other tabs displaying this site.");
  }, 1000);
};

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  clearTimeout(blockedTimeout);
  hideMessage();
  // ...
};

function hideMessage() {
  // Hide a previously displayed message.
}
```

The user will only see the above message if another client fails to disconnect
from the database. Ideally the user will never see this.

# Constructs # {#constructs}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>name</dfn> is a [=string=] equivalent to a {{DOMString}};
that is, an arbitrary sequence of 16-bit code units of any length,
including the empty string. [=/Names=] are always compared as
opaque sequences of 16-bit code units.

<aside class=note>
  As a result, [=/name=] comparison is sensitive to variations in case
  as well as other minor variations such as normalization form, the
  inclusion or omission of controls, and other variations in Unicode
  text. [[Charmod-Norm]]

  If an implementation uses a storage mechanism which does not support
  arbitrary strings, the implementation can use an escaping mechanism
  or something similar to map the provided name to a string that it
  can store.
</aside>

<div algorithm>

To <dfn>create a sorted name list</dfn> from a [=/list=] |names|, run these steps:

1. Let |sorted| be |names| [=list/sorted in ascending order=] with the [=/code unit less than=] algorithm.
1. Return a new {{DOMStringList}} associated with |sorted|.

</div>

<details class=note>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    This matches the [=Array.prototype.sort=] on an [=Array=] of
    [=Strings=]. This ordering compares the 16-bit code units in each
    string, producing a highly efficient, consistent, and deterministic
    sort order. The resulting list will not match any particular
    alphabet or lexicographical order, particularly for code points
    represented by a surrogate pair.
</details>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Database ## {#database-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each [=/storage key=] has an associated set of [=/databases=]. A
<dfn>database</dfn> has zero or more [=/object stores=] which
hold the data stored in the database.

<div dfn-for=database>

A [=/database=] has a <dfn>name</dfn> which identifies it within a
specific [=/storage key=]. The name is a [=/name=],
and stays constant for the lifetime of the database.

A [=/database=] has a <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first
created, its [=database/version=] is 0 (zero).

<aside class=note>
  Each [=/database=] has one version at a time; a [=/database=] can't
  exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the
  version is using an [=/upgrade transaction=].
</aside>

A [=/database=] has at most one associated <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn>,
which is either null or an [=/upgrade transaction=], and is initially null.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Database connection ### {#database-connection}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=/databases=] directly. Instead,
script has indirect access via a <dfn lt="connection|connected">connection</dfn>.
A [=/connection=] object can be used to manipulate the objects of
that [=/database=]. It is also the only way to obtain a
[=/transaction=] for that [=/database=].

The act of opening a [=/database=] creates a [=/connection=].
There may be multiple [=/connections=] to a given [=/database=] at
any given time.

A [=/connection=] can only access [=/databases=] associated with the
[=/storage key=] of the global scope from which the [=/connection=] is
opened.

<aside class=note>
  This is not affected by changes to the {{Document}}'s
  {{Document/domain}}.
</aside>

<div dfn-for=connection>

A [=/connection=] has a <dfn>version</dfn>, which is set when
the [=/connection=] is created. It remains constant for the
lifetime of the [=/connection=] unless an [=/abort
an upgrade transaction|upgrade is aborted=], in which
case it is set to the previous version of the [=/database=]. Once
the [=/connection=] is closed the
[=connection/version=] does not change.

Each connection has a <dfn>close pending flag</dfn> which is initially
false.

When a [=/connection=] is initially created it is in an opened
state. The connection can be <dfn>closed</dfn> through several means.
If the execution context where the [=/connection=] was created is
destroyed (for example due to the user navigating away from that
page), the connection is closed. The connection can also be closed
explicitly using the steps to [=close a database connection=]. When
the connection is closed its [=connection/close pending flag=] is always set to true if
it hasn't already been.

A [=/connection=] may be closed by a user agent in exceptional
circumstances, for example due to loss of access to the file system, a
permission change, or clearing of the [=/storage key=]'s storage. If this occurs
the user agent must run [=close a database
connection=] with the [=/connection=] and with the <var ignore>forced flag</var> set to true.

A [=/connection=] has an <dfn>object store set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of [=/object stores=] in the associated
[=/database=] when the [=/connection=] is created. The contents of the
set will remain constant except when an [=/upgrade transaction=] is
running.

A [=/connection=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns
null.

An event with type <dfn event for=IDBDatabase>`versionchange`</dfn> will be fired at an open
[=/connection=] if an attempt is made to upgrade or delete the
[=/database=]. This gives the [=/connection=] the opportunity to close
to allow the upgrade or delete to proceed.

An event with type <dfn event for=IDBDatabase>`close`</dfn> will be fired at a [=/connection=] if the connection is [=/close a database connection|closed=] abnormally.

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Object store ## {#object-store-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary storage mechanism for
storing data in a [=/database=].

<div dfn-for=object-store>

Each database has a set of [=/object stores=]. The set of [=/object
stores=] can be changed, but only using an [=/upgrade transaction=],
i.e. in response to an <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a> event. When a
new database is created it doesn't contain any [=/object stores=].

An [=/object store=] has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the
data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a
[=/key=] and a [=/value=]. The list is sorted according to key in
[=ascending=] order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
store with the same key.

An [=/object store=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is a [=/name=].
At any one time, the name is unique
within the [=/database=] to which it belongs.

An [=/object store=] optionally has a <dfn>key path</dfn>. If the
object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>.
Otherwise it is said to use <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>.

An [=/object store=] optionally has a [=key generator=].

An object store can derive a [=/key=] for a [=object-store/record=] from
one of three sources:

1. A [=key generator=]. A key generator generates a monotonically
    increasing numbers every time a key is needed.

1. Keys can be derived via a [=object-store/key path=].

1. Keys can also be explicitly specified when a [=/value=] is stored
    in the object store.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Object store handle ### {#object-store-handle-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=/object stores=] directly. Instead,
within a [=/transaction=], script has indirect access via an
<dfn>object store handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=object-store-handle>

An [=/object store handle=] has an associated <dfn>object store</dfn>
and an associated <dfn>transaction</dfn>. Multiple handles may be
associated with the same [=/object store=] in different
[=/transactions=], but there must be only one [=/object store handle=]
associated with a particular [=/object store=] within a
[=/transaction=].

An [=/object store handle=] has an <dfn>index set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of [=/indexes=] that reference the associated
[=object-store-handle/object store=] when the [=/object store handle=]
is created. The contents of the set will remain constant except when
an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.

An [=/object store handle=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is
initialized to the [=object-store/name=] of the associated
[=object-store-handle/object store=] when the [=/object store handle=]
is created. The name will remain constant except when an [=/upgrade
transaction=] is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Values ## {#value-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each record is associated with a <dfn>value</dfn>. User agents must
support any [=serializable object=]. This includes simple types
such as [=String=] primitive values and [=Date=] objects as well as
[=Object=] and [=Array=] instances, {{File}} objects, {{Blob}}
objects, {{ImageData}} objects, and so on. Record [=/values=] are
stored and retrieved by value rather than by reference; later changes
to a value have no effect on the record stored in the database.

Record [=/values=] are [=/Records=] output by the
[$StructuredSerializeForStorage$] operation.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Keys ## {#key-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

In order to efficiently retrieve [=object-store/records=] stored in an indexed
database, each [=object-store/record=] is organized according to its
<dfn>key</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=key>

A [=/key=] has an associated <dfn>type</dfn> which is one of:
*number*,
*date*,
*string*,
*binary*,
or
*array*.

A [=/key=] also has an associated <dfn>value</dfn>, which will
be either:
an {{unrestricted double}} if type is *number* or *date*,
a {{DOMString}} if type is *string*,
a [=byte sequence=] if type is *binary*,
or a [=/list=] of other [=/keys=] if type is *array*.

</div>

An ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value can be converted to a [=/key=] by
following the steps to [=convert a value to a key=].

<aside class=note>
  The following ECMAScript types are valid keys:

  * [=Number=] primitive values, except NaN. This includes Infinity
      and -Infinity.
  * [=Date=] objects, except where the \[[DateValue]]
      internal slot is NaN.
  * [=String=] primitive values.
  * [=ArrayBuffer=] objects (or views on buffers such as
      [=Uint8Array=]).
  * [=Array=] objects, where every item is defined, is itself a valid
      key, and does not directly or indirectly contain itself. This
      includes empty arrays. Arrays can contain other arrays.

  Attempting to convert other ECMAScript values to a [=/key=]
  will fail.
</aside>

An <dfn>array key</dfn> is a [=/key=] with [=key/type=] *array*.
The <dfn>subkeys</dfn> of an [=array key=] are the [=list/items=] of the
[=array key=]'s [=key/value=].

<div algorithm>

To <dfn>compare two keys</dfn> |a| and |b|, run these steps:

1. Let |ta| be the [=key/type=] of |a|.

1. Let |tb| be the [=key/type=] of |b|.

1. If |ta| does not equal |tb|, then run these steps:

    1. If |ta| is *array*, then return 1.
    1. If |tb| is *array*, then return -1.
    1. If |ta| is *binary*, then return 1.
    1. If |tb| is *binary*, then return -1.
    1. If |ta| is *string*, then return 1.
    1. If |tb| is *string*, then return -1.
    1. If |ta| is *date*, then return 1.
    1. [=/Assert=]: |tb| is *date*.
    1. Return -1.

1. Let |va| be the [=key/value=] of |a|.

1. Let |vb| be the [=key/value=] of |b|.

1. Switch on |ta|:

    <dl class=switch>
      : *number*
      : *date*
      ::
          1. If |va| is greater than |vb|, then return 1.
          1. If |va| is less than |vb|, then return -1.
          1. Return 0.

      : *string*
      ::
          1. If |va| is [=code unit less than=] |vb|, then return -1.
          1. If |vb| is [=code unit less than=] |va|, then return 1.
          1. Return 0.

      : *binary*
      ::
          1. If |va| is [=byte less than=] |vb|, then return -1.
          1. If |vb| is [=byte less than=] |va|, then return 1.
          1. Return 0.

## Key path ## {#key-path-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>key path</dfn> is a string or list of strings
that defines how to extract a [=/key=]
from a [=/value=]. A <dfn>valid key path</dfn> is one of:

* An empty string.
* An <dfn>identifier</dfn>, which is a string matching the
    [=IdentifierName=] production from the ECMAScript Language
    Specification [[!ECMA-262]].
* A string consisting of two or more [=identifiers=] separated
    by periods (U+002E FULL STOP).
* A non-empty list containing only strings
    conforming to the above requirements.

<aside class=note>
  Spaces are not allowed within a key path.

## Index ## {#index-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

It is sometimes useful to retrieve [=object-store/records=] in an
[=/object store=] through other means than their
[=/key=]. An <dfn id=index-concept>index</dfn> allows looking up
[=object-store/records=] in an [=/object store=] using properties of the
[=/values=] in the [=/object stores=] [=object-store/records=].

<div dfn-for=index>

An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn
lt="referenced|references">referenced</dfn> [=/object store=]. The
index has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the data stored in
the index. The <dfn>records</dfn> in an index are automatically populated
whenever records in the [=index/referenced=] object store are inserted,
updated or deleted. There can be several [=/indexes=] referencing the
same [=/object store=], in which changes to the object store cause all
such indexes to get updated.

The <dfn>values</dfn> in the index's [=index/records=] are always values of [=/keys=]
in the index's [=index/referenced=] object store. The <dfn>keys</dfn> are derived from
the referenced object store's [=/values=] using a <dfn>key path</dfn>.
If a given [=object-store/record=] with key |X| in the object store referenced by
the index has the value |A|, and [=/extract a key from a
value using a key path|evaluating=] the index's [=index/key path=]
on |A| yields the result |Y|, then the index will contain a record
with key |Y| and value |X|.

<aside class=example id=example-index-entries>
  For example, if an index's [=index/referenced=] object store contains a
  record with the key `123` and the value `{ name:
  "Alice", title: "CEO" }`, and the index's [=index/key path=]
  is "`name`" then the index would contain a record with
  the key "`Alice`" and the value `123`.
</aside>

Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>.
This is the value of the record in the index's referenced object store
which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example
above, the record in the index whose [=index/key=] is |Y| and value is |X| has a
[=index/referenced value=] of |A|.

<aside class=example id=example-index-referenced-values>
  In the preceding example, the record in the index with key
  "`Alice`" and value `123` would have a
  [=index/referenced value=] of `{ name: "Alice", title: "CEO"
  }`.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
  Each record in an index references one and only one record in the
  index's [=index/referenced=] object store. However there can be multiple
  records in an index which reference the same record in the object
  store. And there can also be no records in an index which reference
  a given record in an object store.
</aside>

The [=object-store/records=] in an index are always sorted according to the
[=object-store/record=]'s key. However unlike object stores, a given index can
contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are
additionally sorted according to the [=/index=]'s [=object-store/record=]'s value
(meaning the key of the record in the referenced [=/object store=]).

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is a [=/name=].
At any one time, the name is
unique within index's [=index/referenced=] [=/object store=].

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>unique flag</dfn>. When
true, the index enforces that no two [=object-store/records=] in the index has
the same key. If a [=object-store/record=] in the index's referenced object
store is attempted to be inserted or modified such that evaluating the
index's key path on the records new value yields a result which
already exists in the index, then the attempted modification to the
object store fails.

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>multiEntry flag</dfn>. This flag affects how
the index behaves when the result of evaluating the index's
[=index/key path=] yields an [=array key=]. If its [=index/multiEntry flag=]
is false, then a single [=object-store/record=] whose [=/key=] is an [=array key=]
is added to the index. If its [=index/multiEntry flag=] is true, then
one [=object-store/record=] is added to the index for each of the [=subkeys=].

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Index handle ### {#index-handle-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=/indexes=] directly. Instead, within
a [=/transaction=], script has indirect access via an <dfn>index
handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=index-handle>

An [=index handle=] has an associated <dfn>index</dfn> and an
associated <dfn>object store handle</dfn>. The <dfn>transaction</dfn>
of an [=index handle=] is the [=object-store-handle/transaction=] of
its associated [=/object store handle=]. Multiple handles may be
associated with the same [=/index=] in different [=/transactions=],
but there must be only one [=index handle=] associated with a
particular [=/index=] within a [=/transaction=].

An [=index handle=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is initialized to the
[=index/name=] of the associated [=index-handle/index=] when the
[=index handle=] is created. The name will remain constant except when
an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Transactions ## {#transaction-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn id=transaction-concept>transaction</dfn> is used to interact
with the data in a [=/database=]. Whenever data is read or written
to the database it is done by using a [=/transaction=].

<div dfn-for=transaction>

[=/Transactions=] offer some protection from application and system
failures. A [=/transaction=] may be used to store multiple data
records or to conditionally modify certain data records. A
[=/transaction=] represents an atomic and durable set of data access
and data mutation operations.

All transactions are created through a [=/connection=], which is the
transaction's <dfn>connection</dfn>.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>scope</dfn> which is a [=/set=] of [=/object stores=] that the transaction may interact with.

Note: A [=/transaction=]'s [=transaction/scope=] remains fixed unless the [=/transaction=] is an [=/upgrade transaction=].

Two [=/transactions=] have <dfn lt="overlap|overlapping scope">overlapping scope</dfn> if any [=/object store=] is in both transactions' [=transaction/scope=].

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>mode</dfn> that determines which types
of interactions can be performed upon that transaction. The [=transaction/mode=]
is set when the transaction is created and remains fixed for the life
of the transaction. A [=/transaction=]'s [=transaction/mode=] is one of the
following:

: "{{IDBTransactionMode/readonly}}"
::
    The transaction is only allowed to read data. No modifications can
    be done by this type of transaction. This has the advantage that
    several [=transaction/read-only transactions=] can run at the same time even
    if their [=transaction/scopes=] are [=transaction/overlapping=], i.e. if they are using the
    same object stores. This type of transaction can be created any
    time once a database has been opened.

: "{{IDBTransactionMode/readwrite}}"
::
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores. However object stores and indexes can't be
    added or removed. Multiple "{{IDBTransactionMode/readwrite}}" transactions
    can't run at the same time if their [=transaction/scopes=] are [=transaction/overlapping=]
    since that would mean that they can modify each other's data in
    the middle of the transaction. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.

: "{{IDBTransactionMode/versionchange}}"
::
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores, and can also create and remove object
    stores and indexes. It is the only type of transaction that can do
    so. This type of transaction can't be manually created, but
    instead is created automatically when an
    <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a> event is fired.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>durability hint</dfn>. This is a hint to the user agent of whether to prioritize performance or durability when committing the transaction. The [=transaction/durability hint=] is one of the following:

: "{{IDBTransactionDurability/strict}}"
:: The user agent may consider that the [=/transaction=] has successfully [=transaction/committed=] only after verifying that all outstanding changes have been successfully written to a persistent storage medium.
: "{{IDBTransactionDurability/relaxed}}"
:: The user agent may consider that the [=/transaction=] has successfully [=transaction/committed=] as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the operating system, without subsequent verification.
: "{{IDBTransactionDurability/default}}"
:: The user agent should use its default durability behavior for the [=/storage bucket=]. This is the default for [=/transactions=] if not otherwise specified.

<aside class=note>
  In a typical implementation, "{{IDBTransactionDurability/strict}}" is a hint to the user agent to flush any operating system I/O buffers before a <a event for=IDBTransaction>`complete`</a> event is fired. While this provides greater confidence that the changes will be persisted in case of subsequent operating system crash or power loss, flushing buffers can take significant time and consume battery life on portable devices.

  Web applications are encouraged to use "{{IDBTransactionDurability/relaxed}}" for ephemeral data such as caches or quickly changing records, and "{{IDBTransactionDurability/strict}}" in cases where reducing the risk of data loss outweighs the impact to performance and power. Implementations are encouraged to weigh the durability hint from applications against the impact to users and devices.
</aside>

A [=/transaction=] optionally has a <dfn>cleanup event loop</dfn>
which is an [=/event loop=].

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>request list</dfn> of pending [=/requests=]
which have been made against the transaction.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>error</dfn> which is set if the
[=/transaction=] is [=transaction/aborted=].

A [=/transaction=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns the
transaction's [=transaction/connection=].

A <dfn>read-only transaction</dfn> is
a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=] "{{IDBTransactionMode/readonly}}".

A <dfn>read/write transaction</dfn>
is a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=] "{{IDBTransactionMode/readwrite}}".

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Transaction lifecycle ### {#transaction-lifecycle}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>state</dfn>, which is one
of the following:

: <dfn>active</dfn>
::
    A transaction is in this state when it is first [=transaction/created=],
    and during dispatch of an event from a [=/request=] associated with the transaction.

    New [=/requests=] can be made against the transaction when it is in this state.

: <dfn>inactive</dfn>
::
    A transaction is in this state after control returns to the event
    loop after its creation, and when events are not being dispatched.

    No [=/requests=] can be made against the transaction when it is in this state.

: <dfn>committing</dfn>
::
    Once all [=/requests=] associated with a transaction have completed,
    the transaction will enter this state as it attempts to [=transaction/commit=].

    No [=/requests=] can be made against the transaction when it is in this state.

: <dfn>finished</dfn>
::
    Once a transaction has committed or aborted, it enters this state.

    No [=/requests=] can be made against the transaction when it is in this state.

Transactions are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged by the
[=transaction/commit|automatic committing=] functionality
described below.

<aside class=note>
  Authors can still cause transactions to run for a long time;
  however, this usage pattern is not advised as it can lead to a poor
  user experience.
</aside>

The <dfn>lifetime</dfn> of a
[=/transaction=] is as follows:

1. A transaction is <dfn>created</dfn> with a [=transaction/scope=] and a
    [=transaction/mode=]. When a transaction is created its
    [=transaction/state=] is initially [=transaction/active=].

1. When an implementation is able to enforce the constraints for the
    transaction's [=transaction/scope=] and [=transaction/mode=],
    defined [below](#transaction-scheduling), the implementation must
    [=queue a task=] to <dfn lt="start|started">start</dfn> the
    transaction asynchronously.

    Once the transaction has been [=transaction/started=] the
    implementation can begin executing the [=/requests=] placed
    against the transaction. Requests must be executed in the order in
    which they were made against the transaction. Likewise, their
    results must be returned in the order the requests were placed
    against a specific transaction. There is no guarantee about the
    order that results from requests in different transactions are
    returned.

    <aside class=note>
        Transaction [=transaction/modes=] ensure that two
        requests placed against different transactions can execute in any
        order without affecting what resulting data is stored in the
        database.
    </aside>

1. When each [=/request=] associated with a transaction is [=request/processed=],
    a <a event for=IDBRequest>`success`</a> or <a event for=IDBRequest>`error`</a> [=event=] will be
    fired. While the event is being [=dispatched=], the transaction
    [=transaction/state=] is set to [=transaction/active=], allowing
    additional requests to be made against the transaction. Once the
    event dispatch is complete, the transaction's
    [=transaction/state=] is set to [=transaction/inactive=] again.

1. A transaction can be <dfn lt="abort|aborting|aborted">aborted</dfn>
    at any time before it is [=transaction/finished=], even if the
    transaction isn't currently [=transaction/active=] or hasn't yet
    [=transaction/started=].

    An explicit call to {{IDBTransaction/abort()}} will initiate an
    [=transaction/abort=]. An abort will also be initiated following a
    failed request that is not handled by script.

    When a transaction is aborted the implementation must undo (roll
    back) any changes that were made to the [=/database=] during that
    transaction. This includes both changes to the contents of
    [=/object stores=] as well as additions and removals of [=/object
    stores=] and [=/indexes=].

1. The implementation must attempt to <dfn lt="commit|committed">commit</dfn>
    a transaction when all [=/requests=] placed against the
    transaction have completed and their returned results handled, no
    new requests have been placed against the transaction, and the
    transaction has not been [=transaction/aborted=]

    An explicit call to {{IDBTransaction/commit()}} will initiate a
    [=transaction/commit=] without waiting for request results to be
    handled by script.

    When committing, the transaction [=transaction/state=] is set to
    [=transaction/committing=]. The implementation must atomically
    write any changes to the [=/database=] made by requests placed
    against the transaction. That is, either all of the changes must
    be written, or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the
    implementation must not write any of the changes to the database,
    and the steps to [=abort a transaction=] will be followed.

1. When a transaction is [=transaction/committed=] or [=transaction/aborted=],
    its [=transaction/state=] is set to [=transaction/finished=].


The implementation must allow [=/requests=] to be [=request/placed=]
against the transaction whenever it is [=transaction/active=]. This is
the case even if the transaction has not yet been
[=transaction/started=]. Until the transaction is
[=transaction/started=] the implementation must not execute these
requests; however, the implementation must keep track of the
[=/requests=] and their order.

<div algorithm>

To <dfn id=cleanup-indexed-database-transactions export>cleanup Indexed Database transactions</dfn>, run the following steps.
They will return true if any transactions were cleaned up, or false otherwise.

    1. If there are no [=/transactions=] with [=transaction/cleanup
        event loop=] matching the current [=/event loop=], return false.

    1. For each [=/transaction=] |transaction| with [=transaction/cleanup event loop=]
        matching the current [=/event loop=]:

        1. Set |transaction|'s [=transaction/state=] to [=transaction/inactive=].

        1. Clear |transaction|'s [=transaction/cleanup event loop=].

    1. Return true.
</div>

<aside class=note>
  These steps are invoked by [[HTML]]. They ensure that
  [=/transactions=] created by a script call
  to {{IDBDatabase/transaction()}} are deactivated once the task that
  invoked the script has completed. The steps are run at most once for
  each [=/transaction=].
</aside>

An event with type <dfn event for=IDBTransaction>`complete`</dfn> is fired at
a [=/transaction=] that has successfully [=transaction/committed=].

An event with type <dfn event for=IDBTransaction>`abort`</dfn> is fired at
a [=/transaction=] that has [=transaction/aborted=].

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Transaction scheduling ### {#transaction-scheduling}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The following constraints define when a [=/transaction=] can be [=transaction/started=]:

* A [=transaction/read-only transactions=] |tx| can [=transaction/start=] when there are no <a for=transaction>read/write transactions</a> which:
    * Were [=transaction/created=] before |tx|; and
    * have [=transaction/overlapping scopes=] with |tx|; and
    * are not [=transaction/finished=].
* A <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a> |tx| can [=transaction/start=] when there are no [=/transactions=] which:
    * Were [=transaction/created=] before |tx|; and
    * have [=transaction/overlapping scopes=] with |tx|; and
    * are not [=transaction/finished=].

Implementations may impose additional constraints. For example, implementations are not required to run non-[=transaction/overlapping=] <a for=transaction>read/write transactions</a> in parallel, or may impose limits on the number of running transactions.

<aside class=note>

  These constraints imply the following:

  * Any number of [=transaction/read-only transactions=] are allowed to run concurrently, even if they have [=transaction/overlapping scopes=].
  * As long as a [=transaction/read-only transaction=] is running, the data that the implementation returns through [=/requests=] created with that transaction remains constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of data yield the same result both for the case when data is found and the result is that data, and for the case when data is not found and a lack of data is indicated.
  * A <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a> is only affected by changes to [=/object stores=] that are made using the transaction itself. The implementation ensures that another transaction does not modify the contents of [=/object stores=] in the <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a>'s [=transaction/scope=]. The implementation also ensures that if the <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a> completes successfully, the changes written to [=/object stores=] using the transaction can be committed to the [=/database=] without merge conflicts.
  * If multiple <a for=transaction>read/write transactions</a> are attempting to access the same object store (i.e. if they have [=transaction/overlapping scopes=]), the transaction that was [=transaction/created=] first is the transaction which gets access to the object store first, and it is the only transaction which has access to the object store until the transaction is [=transaction/finished=].
  * Any transaction [=transaction/created=] after a <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a> sees the changes written by the <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a>. For example, if a <a for=transaction>read/write transaction</a> A, is created, and later another transaction B, is created, and the two transactions have [=transaction/overlapping scopes=], then transaction B sees any changes made to any [=/object stores=] that are part of that [=transaction/overlapping scope=]. This also means that transaction B does not have access to any [=/object stores=] in that overlapping [=transaction/scope=] until transaction A is [=transaction/finished=].

</aside>

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Upgrade transactions ### {#upgrade-transaction-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn> is a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=]
"{{IDBTransactionMode/versionchange}}".

An [=/upgrade transaction=] is automatically created when running the
steps to [=run an upgrade transaction=] after a [=/connection=]
is opened to a [=/database=], if a [=database/version=] greater than
the current [=database/version=] is specified. This [=/transaction=]
will be active inside the <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a> event
handler.

<aside class=note>
  An [=/upgrade transaction=] enables the creation, renaming, and
  deletion of [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=] in a [=/database=].

  An [=/upgrade transaction=] is exclusive. The steps to [=open a
  database=] ensure that only one [=/connection=] to the database is
  open when an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.
  The <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a> event isn't fired, and thus the
  [=/upgrade transaction=] isn't started, until all other
  [=/connections=] to the same [=/database=] are closed. This ensures
  that all previous transactions are [=transaction/finished=]. As long
  as an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running, attempts to open more
  [=/connections=] to the same [=/database=] are delayed, and any
  attempts to use the same [=/connection=] to start additional
  transactions by calling {{IDBDatabase/transaction()}} will throw an
  exception. Thus [=/upgrade transactions=] not only ensure that no
  other transactions are running concurrently, but also ensure that no
  new transactions are queued against the same [=/database=] as long
  as the transaction is running.

  This ensures that once an [=/upgrade transaction=] is complete, the
  set of [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=] in a [=/database=] remain
  constant for the lifetime of all subsequent [=/connections=] and
  [=/transactions=].
</aside>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Requests ## {#request-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each asynchronous operation on a [=/database=] is done using a <dfn>request</dfn>. Every request represents one
operation.

<div dfn-for=request>

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>processed flag</dfn> which is initially false.
This flag is set to true when the operation associated with the request has been executed.

A [=/request=] is said to be <dfn>processed</dfn> when its [=request/processed flag=] is true.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>done flag</dfn> which is initially false.
This flag is set to true when the result of the operation associated with the request is available.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>source</dfn> object.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>result</dfn> and an <dfn>error</dfn>, neither
of which are accessible until its [=request/done flag=] is true.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>transaction</dfn> which is initially null.
This will be set when a request is <dfn>placed</dfn> against a
[=/transaction=] using the steps to [=asynchronously execute a
request=].

When a request is made, a new [=/request=] is returned with its [=request/done
flag=] set to false. If a request completes successfully, its [=request/done flag=]
is set to true, its [=request/result=] is set to the result of the request,
and an event with type <dfn event for=IDBRequest>`success`</dfn> is fired at the
[=/request=].

If an error occurs while performing the operation, the request's [=request/done flag=]
is set to true, the request's [=request/error=] is set to the error, and an event with
type <dfn event for=IDBRequest>`error`</dfn> is fired at the request.

A [=/request=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns the request's
[=request/transaction=].

<aside class=note>
  Requests are not typically re-used, but there are exceptions. When a
  [=cursor=] is iterated, the success of the iteration is reported
  on the same [=/request=] object used to open the cursor. And when
  an [=/upgrade transaction=] is necessary, the same [=request/open
  request=] is used for both the <a event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</a>
  event and final result of the open operation itself. In some cases,
  the request's [=request/done flag=] will be set to false, then set to true again, and the
  [=request/result=] can change or [=request/error=] could be set instead.
</aside>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Open requests ### {#open-requests}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>open request</dfn> is a special type of [=/request=] used
when opening a [=/connection=] or deleting a [=/database=].
In addition to <a event for=IDBRequest>`success`</a> and <a event for=IDBRequest>`error`</a> events,
<dfn event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`blocked`</dfn> and <dfn event for=IDBOpenDBRequest>`upgradeneeded`</dfn> events may be fired at an [=request/open
request=] to indicate progress.

The [=request/source=] of an [=request/open request=]
is always null.

The [=request/transaction=] of an [=request/open request=] is null

### Connection queues ### {#connection-queues}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

[=request/Open requests=] are processed in a <dfn>connection queue</dfn>.
The queue contains all [=request/open requests=] associated with an
[=/storage key=] and a [=database/name=]. Requests added to the
[=/connection queue=] processed in order and each request must run
to completion before the next request is processed. An open request
may be blocked on other [=/connections=], requiring those
connections to [=connection/close=] before the request can complete and allow
further requests to be processed.

<aside class=note>
  A [=/connection queue=] is not a [=task queue=] associated with
  an [=/event loop=], as the requests are processed outside any
  specific [=/browsing context=]. The delivery of events to
  completed [=request/open request=] still goes through a [=task queue=]
  associated with the [=/event loop=] of the context where the
  request was made.

## Key range ## {#range-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Records can be retrieved from [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=]
using either [=/keys=] or [=key ranges=]. A <dfn>key range</dfn> is a
continuous interval over some data type used for keys.

<div dfn-for="key range">

A [=/key range=] has an associated <dfn>lower open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is false.

A [=/key range=] has an associated <dfn>upper open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is false.

A [=/key range=] may have a [=key range/lower bound=] [=equal to=] its
[=key range/upper bound=]. A [=/key range=] must not have a [=key range/lower

</div>

A [=/key range=] <dfn>containing only</dfn> |key| has both
[=key range/lower bound=] and [=key range/upper bound=] equal to |key|.

A |key| is <dfn lt="in">in a key range</dfn> |range| if both of the following
conditions are fulfilled:

* The |range|'s [=key range/lower bound=] is null, or it is [=less than=]
    |key|, or it is both [=equal to=] |key| and
    the |range|'s [=key range/lower open flag=] is false.

    |key|, or it is both [=equal to=] |key| and
    the |range|'s [=key range/upper open flag=] is false.

<aside class=note>

  * If a [=/key range=]'s [=key range/lower open flag=] is false, the
    [=key range/lower bound=] [=/key=] of the [=/key range=] is included
    in the range itself.

  * If a [=/key range=]'s [=key range/lower open flag=] is true, the
    [=key range/lower bound=] [=/key=] of the [=/key range=] is excluded
    from the range itself.

  * If a [=/key range=]'s [=key range/upper open flag=] is false, the
    [=key range/upper bound=] [=/key=] of the [=/key range=] is included
    in the range itself.

  * If a [=/key range=]'s [=key range/upper open flag=] is true, the
    [=key range/upper bound=] [=/key=] of the [=/key range=] is excluded
    from the range itself.

</aside>

An <dfn>unbounded key range</dfn> is a [=/key range=] that has both
[=key range/lower bound=] and [=key range/upper bound=] equal to null. All
[=/keys=] are [=in=] an [=unbounded key
range=].

<div algorithm>

To <dfn>convert a value to a key range</dfn> with
|value| and optional |null disallowed flag|, run these steps:

1. If |value| is a [=/key range=], return |value|.

1. If |value| is undefined or is null, then [=exception/throw=] a
    "{{DataError}}" {{DOMException}} if |null disallowed flag| is true, or return an

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Cursor ## {#cursor-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>cursor</dfn> is used to iterate over a range of records in an
[=/index=] or an [=/object store=] in a specific direction.

<div dfn-for=cursor>

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>transaction</dfn>, the [=/transaction=]
that was [=transaction/active=] when the cursor was created.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an
[=/index=] or an [=/object store=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>source</dfn> that indicates which [=/index=]
or an [=/object store=] is associated with the records over which
the [=cursor=] is iterating.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>direction</dfn> that determines whether it
moves in monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the
[=object-store/record=] keys when iterated, and if it skips duplicated values
when iterating indexes. The direction of a cursor also determines if
the cursor initial position is at the start of its
[=cursor/source=] or at its end. A cursor's
[=cursor/direction=] is one of the following:

: "{{IDBCursorDirection/next}}"
::
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should yield all
    records, including duplicates, in monotonically increasing order
    of keys.

: "{{IDBCursorDirection/nextunique}}"
::
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should not yield
    records with the same key, but otherwise yield all records, in
    monotonically increasing order of keys. For every key with
    duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the
    [=cursor/source=] is an [=/object store=] or an [=/index=] with
    its [=index/unique flag=] set to true, this direction has exactly the same
    behavior as "{{IDBCursorDirection/next}}".

: "{{IDBCursorDirection/prev}}"
::
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should yield all
    records, including duplicates, in monotonically decreasing order
    of keys.

: "{{IDBCursorDirection/prevunique}}"
::
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should not
    yield records with the same key, but otherwise yield all records,
    in monotonically decreasing order of keys. For every key with
    duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the
    [=cursor/source=] is an [=/object store=] or an
    [=/index=] with its [=index/unique flag=] set to true, this direction
    has exactly the same behavior as "{{IDBCursorDirection/prev}}".

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>position</dfn> within its range. It is
possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
change before the full [=cursor/range=] of the cursor has been iterated.
In order to handle this, cursors maintain their [=cursor/position=] not as
an index, but rather as a [=/key=] of the previously returned
record. For a forward iterating cursor, the next time the cursor is
asked to iterate to the next record it returns the record with the
lowest [=/key=] [=greater than=] the one previously
returned. For a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite
and it returns the record with the highest [=/key=] [=less
than=] the one previously returned.

For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more
complicated since multiple records can have the same key and are
therefore also sorted by [=/value=]. When iterating indexes the
[=cursor=] also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which
indicates the [=/value=] of the previously found [=object-store/record=] in
the index. Both [=cursor/position=] and the [=cursor/object store position=]
are used when finding the next appropriate record.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn> which
represent the [=/key=] and the [=/value=] of the last iterated
[=object-store/record=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>got value flag</dfn>. When this flag is false,
the cursor is either in the process of loading the next value or it
has reached the end of its [=cursor/range=]. When it is true, it indicates
that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to
iterate to the next one.

If the [=cursor/source=] of a cursor is an [=/object store=], the
<dfn>effective object store</dfn> of the cursor is that object store
and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the cursor's
[=cursor/position=]. If the [=cursor/source=] of a cursor is an [=/index=],
the [=cursor/effective object store=] of the cursor is that index's
[=index/referenced=] object store and the [=cursor/effective key=] is the cursor's
[=cursor/object store position=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>request</dfn>, which is the [=/request=] used
to open the cursor.

A [=cursor=] also has a <dfn>key only flag</dfn>, that indicates
whether the cursor's [=cursor/value=] is exposed via the API.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Key generators ## {#key-generator-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When a [=/object store=] is created it can be specified to use a
<dfn>key generator</dfn>. A key generator is used to generate keys
for records inserted into an object store if not otherwise specified.

<div dfn-for="key generator">

A [=key generator=] has a <dfn>current number</dfn>. The
[=key generator/current number=] is always a positive integer less
than or equal to 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) + 1. The initial value
of a [=key generator=]'s [=key generator/current number=] is 1, set
when the associated [=/object store=] is created. The
[=key generator/current number=] is incremented as keys are generated,
and may be updated to a specific value by using explicit keys.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  Every object store that uses key generators uses a separate
  generator. That is, interacting with one object store never affects
  the key generator of any other object store.
</aside>

Modifying a key generator's [=key generator/current number=] is considered part
of a database operation. This means that if the operation fails
and the operation is reverted, the [=key generator/current number=] is
reverted to the value it had before the operation started. This
applies both to modifications that happen due to the [=key generator/current
number=] getting increased by 1 when the key generator is used,
and to modifications that happen due to a [=object-store/record=] being
stored with a key value specified in the call to store the
[=object-store/record=].

Likewise, if a [=/transaction=] is aborted, the [=key generator/current
number=] of the key generator for each [=/object store=] in
the transaction's [=transaction/scope=] is reverted to the value it had
before the [=/transaction=] was started.

The [=key generator/current number=] for a key generator never decreases, other
than as a result of database operations being reverted. Deleting a
[=object-store/record=] from an [=/object store=] never affects the
object store's key generator. Even clearing all records from an
object store, for example using the {{IDBObjectStore/clear()}} method, does not
affect the [=key generator/current number=] of the object store's key
generator.

When a [=object-store/record=] is stored and a [=/key=] is not specified
in the call to store the record, a key is generated.

<div algorithm>

  To <dfn>generate a key</dfn> for an [=/object store=] |store|, run these steps:

  1. Let |generator| be |store|'s [=key generator=].

  1. Let |key| be |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=].

  1. If |key| is greater than 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992), then return failure.

  1. Increase |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=] by 1.

  1. Return |key|.

</div>

When a [=object-store/record=] is stored and a [=/key=] is specified
in the call to store the record, the associated [=key generator=] may
be updated.

<div algorithm>

  To <dfn>possibly update the key generator</dfn> for an [=/object store=] |store| with |key|,
  run these steps:

  1. If the [=key/type=] of |key| is not *number*, abort these steps.

  1. Let |value| be the [=key/value=] of |key|.

  1. Let |value| be the minimum of |value| and 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992).

  1. Let |value| be the largest integer not greater than |value|.

  1. Let |generator| be |store|'s [=key generator=].

  1. If |value| is greater than or equal to |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=],
      then set |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=] to |value| + 1.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  A key can be specified both for object stores which use
  [=object-store/in-line keys=], by setting the property on the stored value
  which the object store's [=object-store/key path=] points to,
  and for object stores which use [=object-store/out-of-line keys=], by passing
  a key argument to the call to store the [=object-store/record=].

  Only specified keys of [=key/type=] *number* can affect the
  [=key generator/current number=] of the key generator. Keys of [=key/type=]
  *date*, *array* (regardless of the other keys they
  contain), *binary*, or *string* (regardless of whether
  they could be parsed as numbers) have no effect on the [=key generator/current
  number=] of the key generator. Keys of [=key/type=]
  *number* with [=key/value=] less than 1 do not affect the
  [=key generator/current number=] since they are always lower than the
  [=key generator/current number=].
</aside>

When the [=key generator/current number=] of a key generator reaches above the
value 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) any subsequent attempts to use the
key generator to generate a new [=/key=] will result in a
"{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}. It is still possible to insert
[=object-store/records=] into the object store by specifying an explicit
key, however the only way to use a key generator again for such records
is to delete the object store and create a new one.

<aside class=note>
  This limit arises because integers greater than 9007199254740992
  cannot be uniquely represented as ECMAScript [=Numbers=].
  As an example, `9007199254740992 + 1 === 9007199254740992`
  in ECMAScript.

  As long as key generators are used in a normal fashion this limit will
  not be a problem. If you generate a new key 1000 times per
  second day and night, you won't run into this limit for over
  285000 years.
</aside>

A practical result of this is that the first key generated for an
object store is always 1 (unless a higher numeric key is inserted
first) and the key generated for an object store is always a positive
integer higher than the highest numeric key in the store. The same key
is never generated twice for the same object store unless a
transaction is rolled back.

<aside class=example id=example-key-generator>

Each object store gets its own key generator:

```js
store1 = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store2 = db.createObjectStore("store2", { autoIncrement: true });
store2.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store2.put("b"); // Will get key 2
```

If an insertion fails due to constraint violations or IO error, the
key generator is not updated.

```js
transaction.onerror = function(e) { e.preventDefault() };
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
index = store.createIndex("index1", "ix", { unique: true });
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will get key 1
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will fail
store.put({ ix: "b"}); // Will get key 2
```

Removing items from an objectStore never affects the key generator.
Including when {{IDBObjectStore/clear()}} is called.

```js
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.delete(1);
store.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store.clear();
store.put("c"); // Will get key 3
store.delete(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(0));
store.put("d"); // Will get key 4
```

Inserting an item with an explicit key affects the key generator if,
and only if, the key is numeric and higher than the last generated
key.

```js
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.put("b", 3); // Will use key 3
store.put("c"); // Will get key 4
store.put("d", -10); // Will use key -10
store.put("e"); // Will get key 5
store.put("f", 6.00001); // Will use key 6.0001
store.put("g"); // Will get key 7
store.put("f", 8.9999); // Will use key 8.9999
store.put("g"); // Will get key 9
store.put("h", "foo"); // Will use key "foo"
store.put("i"); // Will get key 10
store.put("j", [1000]); // Will use key [1000]
store.put("k"); // Will get key 11
// All of these would behave the same if the objectStore used a
// keyPath and the explicit key was passed inline in the object
```

Aborting a transaction rolls back any increases to the key generator
which happened during the transaction. This is to make all rollbacks
consistent since rollbacks that happen due to crash never has a chance
to commit the increased key generator value.

```js
db.createObjectStore("store", { autoIncrement: true });
trans1 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t1 = trans1.objectStore("store");
store_t1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store_t1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
trans1.abort();
trans2 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t2 = trans2.objectStore("store");
store_t2.put("c"); // Will get key 1
store_t2.put("d"); // Will get key 2
```
</aside>

<aside class=example id=example-inline-keygen>

The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying
to use in-line [=/keys=] and [=key generators=] to save an object
to an [=/object store=].

If the following conditions are true:

* The [=/object store=] has a [=key generator=].

* There is no in-line value for the [=object-store/key path=]
    property.

Then the value provided by the [=key generator=] is used to populate
the key value. In the example below the [=object-store/key path=] for
the object store is "`foo.bar`". The actual object has no
value for the `bar` property, `{ foo: {} }`.
When the object is saved in the [=/object store=] the `bar`
property is assigned a value of 1 because that is the next [=/key=]
generated by the [=key generator=].

```js
const store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                              autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  const key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
};
```

If the following conditions are true:

* The [=/object store=] has a [=key generator=].

* There is a value for the [=object-store/key path=]
    property.

Then the value associated with the [=object-store/key path=]
property is used. The auto-generated [=/key=] is not used. In the
example below the [=object-store/key path=] for the [=/object
store=] is "`foo.bar`". The actual object has a value of
10 for the `bar` property, `{ foo: { bar: 10}
}`. When the object is saved in the [=/object store=] the
`bar` property keeps its value of 10, because that is the
key value.

```js
const store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                              autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: { bar: 10 } }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  const key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 10);
};
```

The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified
in-line [=/key=] is defined through a [=object-store/key
path=] but there is no property matching it. The value provided by
the [=key generator=] is then used to populate the key value and
the system is responsible for creating as many properties as it
requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.
In the example below the [=object-store/key path=] for the
[=/object store=] is "`foo.bar.baz`". The actual
object has no value for the `foo` property, `{ zip: {}
}`. When the object is saved in the [=/object store=]
the `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`
properties are created each as a child of the other until a value for
`foo.bar.baz` can be assigned. The value for
`foo.bar.baz` is the next key generated by the object
store.

```js
const store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar.baz",
                                              autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ zip: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  const key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
  store.get(key).onsuccess = function(e) {
    const value = e.target.result;
    // value will be: { zip: {}, foo: { bar: { baz: 1 } } }
    console.assert(value.foo.bar.baz === 1);
  };
};
```

Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and
throw an error. In the first example below the [=object-store/key
path=] for the object store is "`foo`". The actual object
is a primitive with the value, `4`. Trying to define a
property on that primitive value fails. The same is true for arrays.
Properties are not allowed on an array. In the second example below,
the actual object is an array, `[10]`. Trying to define a
property on the array fails.

```js
const store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo", autoIncrement: true });

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this primitive.
store.put(4); // will throw DataError

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this array.
store.put([10]); // will throw DataError
```

# API # {#async-api}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The API methods return without blocking the calling thread. All
asynchronous operations immediately return an {{IDBRequest}}
instance. This object does not initially contain any information about
the result of the operation. Once information becomes available, an
event is fired on the request and the information becomes available
through the properties of the {{IDBRequest}} instance.

The <span>task source</span> for these tasks is the <dfn id=database-access-task-source export>database access task source</dfn>.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## The {{IDBRequest}} interface ## {#request-api}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{IDBRequest}} interface provides the means to access results of
asynchronous requests to [=/databases=] and [=/database=] objects using
[=event handler IDL attributes=] [[!HTML]].

Every method for making asynchronous requests returns an
{{IDBRequest}} object that communicates back to the requesting
application through events. This design means that any number of
requests can be active on any [=/database=] at a time.

<aside class=example id=example-async-requests>

In the following example, we open a [=/database=] asynchronously.
Various event handlers are registered for responding to various
situations.

```js
const request = indexedDB.open('AddressBook', 15);
request.onsuccess = function(evt) {...};
request.onerror = function(evt) {...};
```

## Event interfaces ## {#events}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification fires events with the following custom interfaces:

<xmp class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBVersionChangeEvent : Event {
  constructor(DOMString type, optional IDBVersionChangeEventInit eventInitDict = {});
  readonly attribute unsigned long long oldVersion;
  readonly attribute unsigned long long? newVersion;

dictionary IDBVersionChangeEventInit : EventInit {
  unsigned long long oldVersion = 0;
  unsigned long long? newVersion = null;
};
</xmp>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>oldVersion</dfn> getter steps are to return the value it was initialized to. It represents the previous version of the database.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>newVersion</dfn> getter steps are to return the value it was initialized to. It represents the new version of the database, or null if the database is being deleted. See the steps to [=run an upgrade transaction=].

Events are constructed as defined in [[DOM#constructing-events]].

<div algorithm>

  To <dfn>fire a version change event</dfn> named |e| at |target| given
  |oldVersion| and |newVersion|, run these steps:

  1. Let |event| be the result of [=creating an event=] using
      {{IDBVersionChangeEvent}}.
  1. Set |event|'s {{Event/type}} attribute to |e|.
  1. Set |event|'s {{Event/bubbles}} and {{Event/cancelable}} attributes to false.
  1. Set |event|'s {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/oldVersion}} attribute to |oldVersion|.
  1. Set |event|'s {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/newVersion}} attribute to |newVersion|.
  1. Let |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag| be false.
  1. [=Dispatch=] |event| at |target| with |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag|.
  1. Return |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag|.
      <aside class=note>
        The return value of this algorithm is not always used.

    [=object-store/key path=] to |keyPath|.

1. Return a new [=/object store handle=] associated with
    |store| and |transaction|.

</div>

This method creates and returns a new [=/object store=] with the given
name in the [=connected=] [=/database=]. Note that this method must
only be called from within an [=/upgrade transaction=].

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to run
into problems after queuing a task to create the [=/object store=]
after the {{IDBDatabase/createObjectStore()}} method has returned. For example in
implementations where metadata about the newly created [=/object
store=] is inserted into the database asynchronously, or where the
implementation might need to ask the user for permission for quota
reasons. Such implementations must still create and return an
{{IDBObjectStore}} object, and once the implementation determines that
creating the [=/object store=] has failed, it must abort the
transaction using the steps to [=abort a transaction=] using the
appropriate error. For example if creating the [=/object store=]
failed due to quota reasons, a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}} must be used as
error.


<div algorithm>

The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>deleteObjectStore(|name|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |database| be [=/this=]'s associated [=/database=].

1. Let |transaction| be |database|'s [=database/upgrade transaction=]
    if it is not null, or [=exception/throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
    {{DOMException}} otherwise.

1. If |transaction|'s [=transaction/state=] is not [=transaction/active=],
    then [=exception/throw=] a "{{TransactionInactiveError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Let |store| be the [=/object store=]
    [=object-store/named=] |name| in |database|,
    or [=exception/throw=] a "{{NotFoundError}}" {{DOMException}} if none.

1. Remove |store| from [=/this=]'s [=connection/object store set=].

1. If there is an [=/object store handle=] associated with
    |store| and |transaction|, remove all entries from its
    [=object-store-handle/index set=].

1. Destroy |store|.

</div>

This method destroys the [=/object store=] with the given name in the
[=connected=] [=/database=]. Note that this method must only be called
from within an [=/upgrade transaction=].

This method synchronously modifies the

</div>

This method creates and returns a new [=/index=] with the
given name in the [=/object store=]. Note that this method
must only be called from within an [=/upgrade transaction=].

The index that is requested to be created can contain constraints on
the data allowed in the index's [=index/referenced=] object store, such
as requiring uniqueness of the values referenced by the index's
[=index/key path=]. If the [=index/referenced=] object store already contains data
which violates these constraints, this must not cause the
implementation of {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} to throw an
exception or affect what it returns. The implementation must still
create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object, and the implementation must
[=queue a task=] to abort the [=/upgrade transaction=] which was
used for the {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} call.

This method synchronously modifies the {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}}
property on the {{IDBObjectStore}} instance on which it was called.
Although this method does not return an {{IDBRequest}} object, the
index creation itself is processed as an asynchronous request within
the [=/upgrade transaction=].

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to
asynchronously run into problems creating the index after the
createIndex method has returned. For example in implementations where
metadata about the newly created index is queued up to be inserted
into the database asynchronously, or where the implementation might
need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons. Such
implementations must still create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object,
and once the implementation determines that creating the index has
failed, it must run the steps to [=abort
a transaction=] using an appropriate error. For example
if creating the [=/index=] failed due to quota reasons,
a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}} must be used as error and if the index can't be
created due to [=index/unique flag=] constraints, a "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}
must be used as error.

<aside class=example id=example-async-index-creation>

  The asynchronous creation of indexes is observable in the following example:

```js
    const request1 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 1);
    const request2 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 2);
    const index = objectStore.createIndex("by_name", "name", {unique: true});
```

  At the point where {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} called, neither of the
  [=/requests=] have executed. When the second request executes, a
  duplicate name is created. Since the index creation is considered an
  asynchronous [=/request=], the index's [=index/unique flag|uniqueness constraint=]
  does not cause the second
  [=/request=] to fail. Instead, the [=/transaction=] will
  be [=transaction/aborted=] when the index is created and the constraint
  fails.

<aside class=note>
  These steps are similar to those to [=convert a value to a key=]
  but if the top-level value is an [=Array=] then members which can
  not be converted to keys are ignored, and duplicates are removed.

  For example, the value `[10, 20, null, 30, 20]` is
  converted to an [=array key=] with [=subkeys=] 10, 20, 30.

# Privacy considerations # {#privacy}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## User tracking ## {#user-tracking}

A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier stored in
its client-side database to track a user across multiple sessions,
building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction with a
site that is aware of the user's real id object (for example an
e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could
allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy
than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk
of user tracking:


: Blocking third-party storage
::
    User agents may restrict access to the database objects
    to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
    the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
    the API for pages from other domains running in `iframe`s.

: Expiring stored data
::
    User agents may automatically delete stored data after a period of
    time.

    This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the site
    would then only be able to track the user across multiple sessions
    when she authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by making a purchase
    or logging in to a service).

    However, this also puts the user's data at risk.

: Treating persistent storage as cookies
::
    User agents should present the database feature to the user in a way
    that associates them strongly with HTTP session cookies. [[COOKIES]]

    This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
    suspicion.

: Site-specific safe-listing of access to databases
::
    User agents may require the user to authorize access to databases
    before a site can use the feature.

: Attribution of third-party storage
::
    User agents may record the [=/origins=] of sites that contained content
    from third-party [=/origins=] that caused data to be stored.

    If this information is then used to present the view of data
    currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
    informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
    prune. Combined with a blocklist ("delete this data and prevent
    this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
    the use of persistent storage to sites that she trusts.

: Shared blocklists
::
    User agents may allow users to share their persistent storage
    domain blocklists.

    This would allow communities to act together to protect their
    privacy.

While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
pass all this information to the third party along with any
identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
created.

However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
sites, using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
separate sessions into coherent user profiles.


## Cookie resurrection ## {#cookie-resurrection}

If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
persistent storage features described in this specification separately
from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely to delete
data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to use the two
features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a user's
attempts to protect his privacy.


## Sensitivity of data ## {#sensitivity-of-data}

User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
mechanism.

To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Security considerations # {#security}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## DNS spoofing attacks ## {#dns-spoofing-attacks}

Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use TLS. Pages using TLS
can be sure that only pages using TLS that have certificates
identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
databases.


## Cross-directory attacks ## {#cross-directory-attacks}

Different authors sharing one host name, for example users hosting
content on `geocities.com`, all share one set of databases.

There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these features,
as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data and
overwrite it.

<aside class=note>
  Even if a path-restriction feature was made available, the usual DOM
  scripting security model would make it trivial to bypass this
  protection and access the data from any path.
</aside>

## Implementation risks ## {#implementation-risks}

The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
features are letting hostile sites read information from other
domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then read
from other domains.

Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be read
from their domain causes *information leakage*, For example, a
user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by another
domain for targeted advertising; or a user's work-in-progress
confidential documents stored by a word-processing site could be
examined by the site of a competing company.

Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
other domains can result in *information spoofing*, which is
equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
the user's actions on the victim site.

Thus, strictly following the storage key partitioning model described in
this specification is important for user security.

If host names or database names are used to construct paths for
persistence to a file system they must be appropriately escaped to
prevent an adversary from accessing information from other [=/storage keys=]
using relative paths such as "`../`".

## Persistence risks ## {#persistence-risks}

Practical implementations will persist data to a non-volatile storage
medium. Data will be serialized when stored and deserialized when
retrieved, although the details of the serialization format will be
user-agent specific. User agents are likely to change their
serialization format over time. For example, the format may be updated
to handle new data types, or to improve performance. To satisfy the
operational requirements of this specification, implementations must
therefore handle older serialization formats in some way. Improper
handling of older data can result in security issues. In addition to
basic serialization concerns, serialized data could encode assumptions
which are not valid in newer versions of the user agent.

A practical example of this is the [=RegExp=] type. The
[$StructuredSerializeForStorage$] operation allows serializing [=RegExp=]
objects. A typical user agent will compile a regular expression into
native machine instructions, with assumptions about how the input data
is passed and results returned. If this internal state was serialized
as part of the data stored to the database, various problems could
arise when the internal representation was later deserialized. For
example, the means by which data was passed into the code could have
changed. Security bugs in the compiler output could have been
identified and fixed in updates to the user agent, but remain in the
serialized internal state.

User agents must identify and handle older data appropriately. One
approach is to include version identifiers in the serialization
format, and to reconstruct any internal state from script-visible
state when older data is encountered.

# Accessibility considerations # {#accessibility}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

*This section is non-normative.*

The API described by this specification has limited accesibility considerations:

* It does not provide for visual rendering of content, or control over color.
* It does not provide features to accept user input.
* It does not provide user interaction features.
* It does not define document semantics.
* It does not provide time-based visual media.
* It does not allow time limits.
* It does not directly provide content for end-users, either in textual, graphical or other or non-textual form.
* It does not define a transmission protocol.

The API does allow storage of structured content. Textual content can be stored as strings. Support exists in the API for developers to store alternative non-textual content such as images or audio as {{Blob}}, {{File}}, or {{ImageData}} objects. Developers producing dynamic content applications using the API should ensure that the content is accessible to users with a variety of technologies and needs.

While the API itself does not define a specific mechanism for it, storage of structured content also allows developers to store internationalized content, using different records or structure within records to hold language alternatives.

The API does not define or require any a user agent to generate a user interface to enable interaction with the API. User agents may optionally provide user interface elements to support the API. Examples include prompts to users when additional storage quota is required, functionality to observe storage used by particular web sites, or tools specific to the API's storage such as inspecting, modifying, or deleting records. Any such user interface elements must be designed with accessibility tools in mind. For example, a user interface presenting the fraction of storage quota used in graphical form must also provide the same data to tools such as screen readers.
