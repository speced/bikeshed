Title: Indexed Database API 3.0
Shortname: IndexedDB
Abstract: This document defines APIs for a database of records holding
    simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key
    and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records
    it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate
    records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can
    be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a
    persistent B-tree data structure.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
# Introduction # {#introduction}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in order to
satisfy off-line data requirements of Web applications. [[WEBSTORAGE]]
is useful for storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values.
However, it does not provide in-order retrieval of keys, efficient
searching over values, or storage of duplicate values for a key.

This specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced
key-value data management that is at the heart of most sophisticated
query processors. It does so by using transactional databases to store
keys and their corresponding values (one or more per key), and
providing a means of traversing keys in a deterministic order. This is
often implemented through the use of persistent B-tree data structures
that are considered efficient for insertion and deletion as well as
in-order traversal of very large numbers of data records.


<aside class=example id=example-open-connection>
In the following example, the API is used to access a "library"
database that holds books stored by their "isbn" attribute.
Additionally, an index is maintained on the "title" attribute of the
objects stored in the object store. This index can be used to look up
books by title, and enforces a uniqueness constraint. Another index is
maintained on the "author" attribute of the objects, and can be used
to look up books by author.

A connection to the database is opened. If the "library" database did
not already exist, it is created and an event handler creates the
object store and indexes. Finally, the opened connection is saved for
use in subsequent examples.

```js
var request = indexedDB.open("library");

request.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // The database did not previously exist, so create object stores and indexes.
  var db = request.result;
  var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
  var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
  var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");

  // Populate with initial data.
  store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
  store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
  store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result;
};
```

The following example populates the database using a transaction.

```js
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");

store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});

tx.oncomplete = function() {
  // All requests have succeeded and the transaction has committed.
};
```

The following example looks up a single book in the database by title
using an index.

```js
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_title");

var request = index.get("Bedrock Nights");
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var matching = request.result;
  if (matching !== undefined) {
    // A match was found.
    report(matching.isbn, matching.title, matching.author);
  } else {
    // No match was found.
    report(null);
  }
};
```

The following example looks up all books in the database by author
using an index and a cursor.

```js
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_author");

var request = index.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.only("Fred"));
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    // Called for each matching record.
    report(cursor.value.isbn, cursor.value.title, cursor.value.author);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    // No more matching records.
    report(null);
  }
};
```

The following example shows how errors could be handled when a request
fails.

```js
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var request = store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Slate", isbn: 987654});
request.onerror = function(event) {
  // The uniqueness constraint of the "by_title" index failed.
  report(request.error);
  // Could call event.preventDefault() to prevent the transaction from aborting.
};
tx.onabort = function() {
  // Otherwise the transaction will automatically abort due the failed request.
  report(tx.error);
};
```

The database connection can be closed when it is no longer needed.

```js
db.close();
```

In the future, the database might have grown to contain other object
stores and indexes. The following example shows one way to handle
migrating from an older version of the database.

```js
var request = indexedDB.open("library", 3); // Request version 3.

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  var db = request.result;
  if (event.oldVersion < 1) {
    // Version 1 is the first version of the database.
    var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
    var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
    var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion < 2) {
    // Version 2 introduces a new index of books by year.
    var bookStore = request.transaction.objectStore("books");
    var yearIndex = bookStore.createIndex("by_year", "year");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion < 3) {
    // Version 3 introduces a new object store for magazines with two indexes.
    var magazines = db.createObjectStore("magazines");
    var publisherIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_publisher", "publisher");
    var frequencyIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_frequency", "frequency");
  }
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result; // db.version will be 3.
};
```
</aside>

<aside class=example id=handling-versionchange>
A single database can be used by multiple clients (pages and workers)
simultaneously &mdash; transactions ensure they don't clash while reading and writing.
If a new client wants to upgrade the database (via the <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a>
event), it cannot do so until all other clients close their connection to the
current version of the database.

To avoid blocking a new client from upgrading, clients can listen for the
<a event>`versionchange`</a> event. This fires when another client is wanting to upgrade the
database. To allow this to continue, react to the <a event>`versionchange`</a> event by doing
something that ultimately closes this client's [=/connection=] to the database.

One way of doing this is to reload the page:

```js
db.onversionchange = function() {
  // First, save any unsaved data:
  saveUnsavedData().then(function() {
    // If the document isn't being actively used, it could be appropriate to reload
    // the page without the user's interaction.
    if (!document.hasFocus()) {
      location.reload();
      // Reloading will close the database, and also reload with the new JavaScript
      // and database definitions.
    } else {
      // If the document has focus, it can be too disruptive to reload the page.
      // Maybe ask the user to do it manually:
      displayMessage("Please reload this page for the latest version.");
    }
  });
};

function saveUnsavedData() {
  // How you do this depends on your app.
}

function displayMessage() {
  // Show a non-modal message to the user.
}
```

Another way is to call the [=/connection=]'s {{IDBDatabase/close()}} method. However, you need to make
sure your app is aware of this, as subsequent attempts to access the database
will fail.

```js
db.onversionchange = function() {
  saveUnsavedData().then(function() {
    db.close();
    stopUsingTheDatabase();
  });
};

function stopUsingTheDatabase() {
  // Put the app into a state where it no longer uses the database.
}
```

The new client (the one attempting the upgrade) can use the <a event>`blocked`</a> event to
detect if other clients are preventing the upgrade from happening. The <a event>`blocked`</a>
event fires if other clients still hold a connection to the database after their
<a event>`versionchange`</a> events have fired.

```js
var request = indexedDB.open("library", 4); // Request version 4.
var blockedTimeout;

request.onblocked = function() {
  // Give the other clients time to save data asynchronously.
  blockedTimeout = setTimeout(function() {
    displayMessage("Upgrade blocked - Please close other tabs displaying this site.");
  }, 1000);
};

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  clearTimeout(blockedTimeout);
  hideMessage();
  // ...
};

function hideMessage() {
  // Hide a previously displayed message.
}
```

The user will only see the above message if another client fails to disconnect
from the database. Ideally the user will never see this.

# Constructs # {#constructs}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>name</dfn> is a string equivalent to a {{DOMString}};
that is, an arbitrary sequence of 16-bit code units of any length,
including the empty string. [=/Names=] are always compared as
opaque sequences of 16-bit code units.

<aside class=note>
  As a result, [=/name=] comparison is sensitive to variations in case
  as well as other minor variations such as normalization form, the
  inclusion or omission of controls, and other variations in Unicode
  text. [[Charmod-Norm]]

  If an implementation uses a storage mechanism which does not support
  arbitrary strings, the implementation can use an escaping mechanism
  or something similar to map the provided name to a string that it
  can store.
</aside>

A <dfn>sorted name list</dfn> is a list containing [=/names=]
sorted in ascending order by 16-bit code unit.

<details class=note>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    <p>This matches the [=Array.prototype.sort=] on an [=Array=] of
    [=Strings=]. This ordering compares the 16-bit code units in each
    string, producing a highly efficient, consistent, and deterministic
    sort order. The resulting list will not match any particular
    alphabet or lexicographical order, particularly for code points
    represented by a surrogate pair.</p>
</details>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Database ## {#database-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each [=/origin=] has an associated set of [=databases=]. A
<dfn>database</dfn> has zero or more [=/object stores=] which
hold the data stored in the database.

<div dfn-for=database>

A [=database=] has a <dfn>name</dfn> which identifies it within a
specific [=/origin=]. The name is a [=/name=],
and stays constant for the lifetime of the database.

A [=database=] has a <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first
created, its [=database/version=] is 0 (zero).

<aside class=note>
  Each [=database=] has one version at a time; a [=database=] can't
  exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the
  version is using an [=/upgrade transaction=].
</aside>

A [=database=] has at most one associated <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn>,
which is either null or an [=/upgrade transaction=], and is initially null.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Database Connection ### {#database-connection}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=databases=] directly. Instead,
script has indirect access via a <dfn lt="connection|connected">connection</dfn>.
A [=/connection=] object can be used to manipulate the objects of
that [=database=]. It is also the only way to obtain a
[=/transaction=] for that [=database=].

The act of opening a [=database=] creates a [=/connection=].
There may be multiple [=/connections=] to a given [=database=] at
any given time.

A [=/connection=] can only access [=databases=] associated with the
[=/origin=] of the global scope from which the [=/connection=] is
opened.

<aside class=note>
  This is not affected by changes to the {{Document}}'s
  {{Document/domain}}.
</aside>

<div dfn-for=connection>

A [=/connection=] has a <dfn>version</dfn>, which is set when
the [=/connection=] is created. It remains constant for the
lifetime of the [=/connection=] unless an <a data-lt="abort
an upgrade transaction">upgrade is aborted</a>, in which
case it is set to the previous version of the [=database=]. Once
the [=/connection=] is closed the
[=connection/version=] does not change.

Each connection has a <dfn>close pending flag</dfn> which is initially
unset.

When a [=/connection=] is initially created it is in an opened
state. The connection can be <dfn>closed</dfn> through several means.
If the execution context where the [=/connection=] was created is
destroyed (for example due to the user navigating away from that
page), the connection is closed. The connection can also be closed
explicitly using the steps to [=close a database connection=]. When
the connection is closed the [=close pending flag=] is always set if
it hasn't already been.

A [=/connection=] may be closed by a user agent in exceptional
circumstances, for example due to loss of access to the file system, a
permission change, or clearing of the origin's storage. If this occurs
the user agent must run the steps to [=close a database
connection=] with the [=/connection=] and with the |forced flag| set.

A [=/connection=] has an <dfn>object store set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of [=/object stores=] in the associated
[=database=] when the [=/connection=] is created. The contents of the
set will remain constant except when an [=/upgrade transaction=] is
running.

A [=/connection=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns
null.

A <dfn event>`versionchange`</dfn> will be fired at an open
[=/connection=] if an attempt is made to upgrade or delete the
[=database=]. This gives the [=/connection=] the opportunity to close
to allow the upgrade or delete to proceed.

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Object Store ## {#object-store-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary storage mechanism for
storing data in a [=database=].

<div dfn-for=object-store>

Each database has a set of [=/object stores=]. The set of [=/object
stores=] can be changed, but only using an [=/upgrade transaction=],
i.e. in response to an <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event. When a
new database is created it doesn't contain any [=/object stores=].

An [=/object store=] has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the
data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a
[=/key=] and a [=/value=]. The list is sorted according to key in
[=ascending=] order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
store with the same key.

An [=/object store=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is a [=/name=].
At any one time, the name is unique
within the [=database=] to which it belongs.

An [=/object store=] optionally has a <dfn>key path</dfn>. If the
object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>.
Otherwise it is said to use <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>.

An [=/object store=] optionally has a [=key generator=].

An object store can derive a [=/key=] for a [=object-store/record=] from
one of three sources:

1. A [=key generator=]. A key generator generates a monotonically
    increasing numbers every time a key is needed.

1. Keys can be derived via a [=object-store/key path=].

1. Keys can also be explicitly specified when a [=/value=] is stored
    in the object store.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Object Store Handle ### {#object-store-handle-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=/object stores=] directly. Instead,
within a [=/transaction=], script has indirect access via an
<dfn>object store handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=object-store-handle>

An [=/object store handle=] has an associated <dfn>object store</dfn>
and an associated <dfn>transaction</dfn>. Multiple handles may be
associated with the same [=/object store=] in different
[=/transactions=], but there must be only one [=/object store handle=]
associated with a particular [=/object store=] within a
[=/transaction=].

An [=/object store handle=] has an <dfn>index set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of [=/indexes=] that reference the associated
[=object-store-handle/object store=] when the [=/object store handle=]
is created. The contents of the set will remain constant except when
an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.

An [=/object store handle=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is
initialized to the [=object-store/name=] of the associated
[=object-store-handle/object store=] when the [=/object store handle=]
is created. The name will remain constant except when an [=/upgrade
transaction=] is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Values ## {#value-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each record is associated with a <dfn>value</dfn>. User agents must
support any [=serializable object=]. This includes simple types
such as [=String=] primitive values and [=Date=] objects as well as
[=Object=] and [=Array=] instances, {{File}} objects, {{Blob}}
objects, {{ImageData}} objects, and so on. Record [=/values=] are
stored and retrieved by value rather than by reference; later changes
to a value have no effect on the record stored in the database.

Record [=/values=] are [=/Records=] output by the
<a abstract-op>StructuredSerializeForStorage</a> operation.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Keys ## {#key-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

In order to efficiently retrieve [=object-store/records=] stored in an indexed
database, each [=object-store/record=] is organized according to its
<dfn>key</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=key>

A [=/key=] has an associated <dfn>type</dfn> which is one of:
*number*,
*date*,
*string*,
*binary*,
or
*array*.

A [=/key=] also has an associated <dfn>value</dfn>, which will
be either:
an {{unrestricted double}} if type is *number* or *date*,
a {{DOMString}} if type is *string*,
a list of {{octet}}s if type is *binary*,
or a list of other [=/keys=] if type is *array*.

</div>

An ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value can be converted to a [=/key=] by
following the steps to [=convert a value to a key=].

<aside class=note>
  The following ECMAScript types are valid keys:

  * [=Number=] primitive values, except NaN. This includes Infinity
      and -Infinity.
  * [=Date=] objects, except where the \[[DateValue]]
      internal slot is NaN.
  * [=String=] primitive values.
  * [=ArrayBuffer=] objects (or views on buffers such as
      [=Uint8Array=]).
  * [=Array=] objects, where every item is defined, is itself a valid
      key, and does not directly or indirectly contain itself. This
      includes empty arrays. Arrays can contain other arrays.

  Attempting to convert other ECMAScript values to a [=/key=]
  will fail.
</aside>

An <dfn>array key</dfn> is a [=/key=] with [=key/type=] *array*.
The <dfn>subkeys</dfn> of an [=array key=] are the members of the
[=array key=]'s [=key/value=] list.

<div class=algorithm>

To <dfn>compare two keys</dfn> |a| and |b|, run these steps:

1. Let |ta| be the [=key/type=] of |a|.

1. Let |tb| be the [=key/type=] of |b|.

1. If |ta| is *array* and |tb| is *binary*, *string*,
    *date* or *number*, return 1.

1. If |tb| is *array* and |ta| is *binary*, *string*,
    *date* or *number*, return -1.

1. If |ta| is *binary* and |tb| is *string*, *date* or
    *number*, return 1.

1. If |tb| is *binary* and |ta| is *string*, *date* or
    *number*, return -1.

1. If |ta| is *string* and |tb| is *date* or *number*,
    return 1.
1. If |tb| is *string* and |ta| is *date* or *number*,
    return -1.

1. If |ta| is *date* and |tb| is *number*, return 1.

1. If |tb| is *date* and |ta| is *number*, return -1.

1. Assert: |ta| and |tb| are equal.

1. Let |va| be the [=key/value=] of |a|.

1. Let |vb| be the [=key/value=] of |b|.

1. Switch on |ta|:

    <dl class=switch>
      <dt>*number*</dt>
      <dt>*date*</dt>
      <dd>
        1. If |va| is greater than |vb|, then return 1.
        1. If |va| is less than |vb|, then return -1.
        1. Return 0.
      </dd>

      <dt>*string*</dt>
      <dd>
        1. Let |length| be the lesser of |va|'s length and |vb|'s length.
        1. Let |i| be 0.
        1. While |i| is less than |length|, then:
            1. Let |u| be the code unit of |va| at index |i|.
            1. Let |v| be the code unit of |vb| at index |i|.
            1. If |u| is greater than |v| then return 1.
            1. If |u| is less than |v| then return -1.
            1. Increase |i| by 1.
        1. If |va|'s length is greater than |vb|'s length, then return 1.
        1. If |va|'s length is less than |vb|'s length, then return -1.
        1. Return 0.
      </dd>

      <dt>*binary*</dt>
      <dd>
        1. Let |length| be the lesser of |va|'s length and |vb|'s length.
        1. Let |i| be 0.

## Key Path ## {#key-path-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>key path</dfn> is a string or list of strings
that defines how to extract a [=/key=]

* An empty string.
* An <dfn>identifier</dfn>, which is a string matching the

* A string consisting of two or more [=identifiers=] separated
    by periods (U+002E FULL STOP).
* A non-empty list containing only strings
    conforming to the above requirements.

<aside class=note>
  Spaces are not allowed within a key path.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Index ## {#index-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

It is sometimes useful to retrieve [=object-store/records=] in an
[=/object store=] through other means than their
[=/key=]. An <dfn id=index-concept>index</dfn> allows looking up
[=object-store/records=] in an [=/object store=] using properties of the
[=/values=] in the [=/object stores=] [=object-store/records=].

<div dfn-for=index>

An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn
lt="referenced|references">referenced</dfn> [=/object store=]. The
index has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the data stored in
the index. The <dfn>records</dfn> in an index are automatically populated
whenever records in the [=referenced=] object store are inserted,
updated or deleted. There can be several [=/indexes=] referencing the
same [=/object store=], in which changes to the object store cause all
such indexes to get updated.

The <dfn>values</dfn> in the index's [=index/records=] are always values of [=/keys=]
in the index's [=referenced=] object store. The <dfn>keys</dfn> are derived from
the referenced object store's [=/values=] using a <dfn>key path</dfn>.
If a given [=object-store/record=] with key |X| in the object store referenced by
the index has the value |A|, and <a data-lt="extract a key from a
value using a key path">evaluating</a> the index's [=index/key path=]
on |A| yields the result |Y|, then the index will contain a record
with key |Y| and value |X|.

<aside class=example id=example-index-entries>
  For example, if an index's [=referenced=] object store contains a
  record with the key `123` and the value `{ name:
  "Alice", title: "CEO" }`, and the index's [=index/key path=]
  is "`name`" then the index would contain a record with
  the key "`Alice`" and the value `123`.
</aside>

Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>.
This is the value of the record in the index's referenced object store
which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example
above, the record in the index whose [=index/key=] is |Y| and value is |X| has a
[=referenced value=] of |A|.

<aside class=example id=example-index-referenced-values>
  In the preceding example, the record in the index with key
  "`Alice`" and value `123` would have a
  [=referenced value=] of `{ name: "Alice", title: "CEO"
  }`.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
  Each record in an index references one and only one record in the
  index's [=referenced=] object store. However there can be multiple
  records in an index which reference the same record in the object
  store. And there can also be no records in an index which reference
  a given record in an object store.
</aside>

The [=object-store/records=] in an index are always sorted according to the
[=object-store/record=]'s key. However unlike object stores, a given index can
contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are
additionally sorted according to the [=/index=]'s [=object-store/record=]'s value
(meaning the key of the record in the referenced [=/object store=]).

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is a [=/name=].
At any one time, the name is
unique within index's [=referenced=] [=/object store=].

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>unique flag</dfn>. When this flag is
set, the index enforces that no two [=object-store/records=] in the index has
the same key. If a [=object-store/record=] in the index's referenced object
store is attempted to be inserted or modified such that evaluating the
index's key path on the records new value yields a result which
already exists in the index, then the attempted modification to the
object store fails.

An [=/index=] has a <dfn>multiEntry flag</dfn>. This flag affects how
the index behaves when the result of evaluating the index's
[=index/key path=] yields an [=array key=]. If the [=multiEntry flag=]
is unset, then a single [=object-store/record=] whose [=/key=] is an [=array key=]
is added to the index. If the [=multiEntry flag=] is true, then the
one [=object-store/record=] is added to the index for each of the [=subkeys=].

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Index Handle ### {#index-handle-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with [=/indexes=] directly. Instead, within
a [=/transaction=], script has indirect access via an <dfn>index
handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=index-handle>

An [=index handle=] has an associated <dfn>index</dfn> and an
associated <dfn>object store handle</dfn>. The <dfn>transaction</dfn>
of an [=index handle=] is the [=object-store-handle/transaction=] of
its associated [=/object store handle=]. Multiple handles may be
associated with the same [=/index=] in different [=/transactions=],
but there must be only one [=index handle=] associated with a
particular [=/index=] within a [=/transaction=].

An [=index handle=] has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is initialized to the
[=index/name=] of the associated [=index-handle/index=] when the
[=index handle=] is created. The name will remain constant except when
an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Transactions ## {#transaction-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn id=transaction-concept>Transaction</dfn> is used to interact
with the data in a [=database=]. Whenever data is read or written
to the database it is done by using a [=/transaction=].

<div dfn-for=transaction>

[=/Transactions=] offer some protection from application and system
failures. A [=/transaction=] may be used to store multiple data
records or to conditionally modify certain data records. A
[=/transaction=] represents an atomic and durable set of data access
and data mutation operations.

All transactions are created through a [=/connection=], which is the
transaction's <dfn>connection</dfn>.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>scope</dfn> that determines the
[=/object stores=] with which the transaction may interact. A
transaction's scope remains fixed for the lifetime of that
transaction.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>mode</dfn> that determines which types
of interactions can be performed upon that transaction. The [=transaction/mode=]
is set when the transaction is created and remains fixed for the life
of the transaction. A [=/transaction=]'s [=transaction/mode=] is one of the
following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"readonly"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is only allowed to read data. No modifications can
    be done by this type of transaction. This has the advantage that
    several [=read-only transactions=] can run at the same time even
    if their [=transaction/scopes=] are overlapping, i.e. if they are using the
    same object stores. This type of transaction can be created any
    time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"readwrite"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores. However object stores and indexes can't be
    added or removed. Multiple {{"readwrite"}} transactions
    can't run at the same time if their [=transaction/scopes=] are overlapping
    since that would mean that they can modify each other's data in
    the middle of the transaction. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"versionchange"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores, and can also create and remove object
    stores and indexes. It is the only type of transaction that can do
    so. This type of transaction can't be manually created, but
    instead is created automatically when an
    <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event is fired.
  </dd>
</dl>

A [=/transaction=] has an <dfn>active flag</dfn>, which determines
if new [=/requests=] can be made against the transaction. A
transaction is said to be <dfn>active</dfn> if its [=transaction/active flag=]
is set.

A [=/transaction=] optionally has a <dfn>cleanup event loop</dfn>
which is an [=event loop=].

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>request list</dfn> of [=/requests=]
which have been made against the transaction.

A [=/transaction=] has a <dfn>error</dfn> which is set if the
[=/transaction=] is [=transaction/aborted=].

A [=/transaction=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns the
transaction's [=transaction/connection=].

A <dfn>read-only transaction</dfn> is
a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=] {{"readonly"}}.

A <dfn>read/write transaction</dfn>
is a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=] {{"readwrite"}}.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Transaction Lifetime ### {#transaction-lifetime-concept}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Transactions are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged by the
<a for=transaction lt=commit>automatic committing</a> functionality
described below.

<aside class=note>
  Authors can still cause transactions to run for a long time;
  however, this usage pattern is not advised as it can lead to a poor
  user experience.
</aside>

The <dfn>lifetime</dfn> of a
[=/transaction=] is as follows:

1. A transaction is <dfn>created</dfn> with a [=transaction/scope=] and a [=transaction/mode=].
    When a transaction is created its [=transaction/active flag=] is initially set.

1. The implementation must allow [=/requests=] to be [=request/placed=]
    against the transaction whenever the [=transaction/active flag=] is set. This
    is the case even if the transaction has not yet been [=transaction/started=].
    Until the transaction is [=transaction/started=] the implementation must not
    execute these requests; however, the implementation must keep
    track of the [=/requests=] and their order. Requests may be placed
    against a transaction only while that transaction is [=transaction/active=].
    If an attempt is made to place a request against a transaction
    when that transaction is not [=transaction/active=], the implementation must
    reject the attempt by throwing a "{{TransactionInactiveError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined
    for the transaction [=transaction/scope=] and [=transaction/mode=], defined below, the
    implementation must [=queue a task=] to <dfn
    lt="start|started">start</dfn> the transaction asynchronously.

1. Once the transaction has been [=transaction/started=] the implementation can
    start executing the [=/requests=] placed against the transaction.
    Unless otherwise defined, requests must be executed in the order
    in which they were made against the transaction. Likewise, their
    results must be returned in the order the requests were placed
    against a specific transaction. There is no guarantee about the
    order that results from requests in different transactions are
    returned. Similarly, the transaction [=transaction/modes=] ensure that two
    requests placed against different transactions can execute in any
    order without affecting what resulting data is stored in the
    database.

1. A transaction can be <dfn lt="abort|aborting|aborted">aborted</dfn>
    at any time before it is [=transaction/finished=], even if the transaction
    isn't currently [=transaction/active=] or hasn't yet [=transaction/started=]. When a
    transaction is aborted the implementation must undo (roll back)
    any changes that were made to the [=database=] during that
    transaction. This includes both changes to the contents of
    [=/object stores=] as well as additions and removals of [=/object
    stores=] and [=/indexes=].

1. A transaction can fail for reasons not tied to a particular
    [=/request=]. For example due to IO errors when committing the
    transaction, or due to running into a quota limit where the
    implementation can't tie exceeding the quota to a partcular
    request. In this case the implementation must run the steps to
    [=abort a transaction=] using the transaction as |transaction|
    and the appropriate error type as |error|. For example if quota
    was exceeded then a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}} should be used as
    |error|, and if an IO error happened, an "{{UnknownError}}" {{DOMException}} should be
    used as |error|.

1. When a transaction has been started and it can no longer become
    [=transaction/active=], the implementation must attempt to <dfn
    lt="commit|committing|committed">commit</dfn> it, as long as the
    transaction has not been [=transaction/aborted=]. This usually happens after
    all requests placed against the transaction have been executed and
    their returned results handled, and no new requests have been
    placed against the transaction. When a transaction is committed,
    the implementation must atomically write any changes to the
    [=database=] made by requests placed against the transaction. That
    is, either all of the changes must be written, or if an error
    occurs, such as a disk write error, the implementation must not
    write any of the changes to the database. If such an error occurs,
    the implementation must [=transaction/abort=] the transaction by following the
    steps to [=abort a transaction=], otherwise it must
    [=transaction/commit=] the transaction by following the steps to
    [=commit a transaction=].

1. When a transaction is [=transaction/committed=] or [=transaction/aborted=], it
    is said to be <dfn lt="finish|finished">finished</dfn>. If a
    transaction can't be finished, for example due to the
    implementation crashing or the user taking some explicit action to
    cancel it, the implementation must [=transaction/abort=] the transaction.

An event with type <dfn event>`complete`</dfn> is fired at
a [=/transaction=] that has successfully [=transaction/committed=].

An event with type <dfn event>`abort`</dfn> is fired at
a [=/transaction=] that has [=transaction/aborted=].

The following constraints define when a [=/transaction=] can be
[=transaction/started=]:

* Any number of [=read-only transactions=] are allowed to run
    concurrently, even if the transaction's [=transaction/scope=] overlap and
    include the same [=/object stores=]. As long as a [=read-only
    transaction=] is running, the data that the implementation returns
    through [=/requests=] created with that transaction must remain
    constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of data
    must yield the same result both for the case when data is found
    and the result is that data, and for the case when data is not
    found and a lack of data is indicated.

    <aside class=note>
      There are a number of ways that an implementation can ensure
      this. The implementation could prevent any <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, whose scope overlaps the scope of the
      [=read-only transaction=], from starting until the
      [=read-only transaction=] finishes. Or the implementation
      could allow the [=read-only transaction=] to see a snapshot
      of the contents of the [=/object stores=] which is taken when
      the [=read-only transaction=] started.
    </aside>

* Similarly, implementations must ensure that a <a>read/write
    transaction</a> is only affected by changes to [=/object
    stores=] that are made using the transaction itself. For
    example, the implementation must ensure that another transaction
    does not modify the contents of [=/object stores=] in the
    <a>read/write transaction</a>'s [=transaction/scope=]. The implementation
    must also ensure that if the <a>read/write transaction</a>
    completes successfully, the changes written to [=/object
    stores=] using the transaction can be committed to the
    [=database=] without merge conflicts. An implementation must
    not abort a transaction due to merge conflicts.

* If multiple <a>read/write transactions</a> are attempting to access
    the same object store (i.e. if they have overlapping [=transaction/scope=]),
    the transaction that was [=transaction/created=] first must be the transaction
    which gets access to the object store first. Due to the
    requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means that it is
    the only transaction which has access to the object store until
    the transaction is [=transaction/finished=].

* Any transaction [=transaction/created=] after a <a>read/write transaction</a>
    must see the changes written by the <a>read/write transaction</a>.
    So if a <a>read/write transaction</a>, A, is created, and later
    another transaction B, is created, and the two transactions have
    overlapping [=transaction/scopes=], then B must see any changes made to any
    [=/object stores=] that are part of that overlapping [=transaction/scope=].
    Due to the requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means
    that the B transaction does not have access to any [=/object
    stores=] in that overlapping [=transaction/scope=] until the A transaction is
    [=transaction/finished=].

    <aside class=note>
      Generally speaking, the above requirements mean that any
      transaction which has an overlapping scope with a <a>read/write
      transaction</a> and which was created after that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, can't run in parallel with that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>.
    </aside>

* User agents must ensure a reasonable level of fairness across
    transactions to prevent starvation. For example, if multiple
    [=read-only transactions=] are started one after another the
    implementation must not indefinitely prevent a pending
    <a>read/write transaction</a> from [=transaction/starting=].

</div>

To <dfn export>cleanup Indexed Database transactions</dfn>, run these steps.
They will return true if any transactions were cleaned up, or false otherwise.

<div class=algorithm>
    1. If there are no [=/transactions=] with [=transaction/cleanup
        event loop=] matching the current [=event loop=], return false.

    1. For each [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/cleanup event loop=]
        matching the current [=event loop=]:

        1. Unset the [=/transaction=]'s [=transaction/active flag=].

        1. Clear the [=/transaction=]'s [=transaction/cleanup event loop=].

    1. Return true.
</div>

<aside class=note>
  This behavior is invoked by [[HTML]]. It ensures that
  [=/transactions=] created by a script call
  to {{IDBDatabase/transaction()}} are deactivated once the task that
  invoked the script has completed. The steps are run at most once for
  each [=/transaction=].
</aside>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Upgrade Transactions ### {#upgrade-transaction-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn> is a [=/transaction=] with [=transaction/mode=]
{{"versionchange"}}.

An [=/upgrade transaction=] is automatically created when running the
steps to [=run an upgrade transaction=] after a [=/connection=]
is opened to a [=/database=], if a [=database/version=] greater than
the current [=database/version=] is specified. This [=/transaction=]
will be active inside the <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event
handler.

<aside class=note>
  An [=/upgrade transaction=] enables the creation, renaming, and
  deletion of [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=] in a [=/database=].

  An [=/upgrade transaction=] is exclusive. The steps to [=open a
  database=] ensure that only one [=/connection=] to the database is
  open when an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running.
  The <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event isn't fired, and thus the
  [=/upgrade transaction=] isn't started, until all other
  [=/connections=] to the same [=/database=] are closed. This ensures
  that all previous transactions are [=transaction/finished=]. As long
  as an [=/upgrade transaction=] is running, attempts to open more
  [=/connections=] to the same [=/database=] are delayed, and any
  attempts to use the same [=/connection=] to start additional
  transactions by calling {{IDBDatabase/transaction()}} will throw an
  exception. Thus [=/upgrade transactions=] not only ensure that no
  other transactions are running concurrently, but also ensure that no
  new transactions are queued against the same [=/database=] as long
  as the transaction is running.

  This ensures that once an [=/upgrade transaction=] is complete, the
  set of [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=] in a [=/database=] remain
  constant for the lifetime of all subsequent [=/connections=] and
  [=/transactions=].
</aside>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Requests ## {#request-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each asynchronous operation on a [=database=] is done using a <dfn>request</dfn>. Every request represents one
operation.

<div dfn-for=request>

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>done flag</dfn> which is initially unset.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>source</dfn> object.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>result</dfn> and an <dfn>error</dfn>, neither
of which are accessible until the [=request/done flag=] is set.

A [=/request=] has a <dfn>transaction</dfn> which is initially null.
This will be set when a request is <dfn>placed</dfn> against a
[=/transaction=] using the steps to [=asynchronously execute a
request=].

When a request is made, a new [=/request=] is returned with its [=request/done
flag=] unset. If a request completes successfully, the [=request/done flag=]
is set, the [=request/result=] is set to the result of the request,
and an event with type <dfn event>`success`</dfn> is fired at the
[=/request=].

If an error occurs while performing the operation, the [=request/done flag=]
is set, the [=request/error=] is set to the error, and an event with
type <dfn event>`error`</dfn> is fired at the request.

A [=/request=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns the request's
[=request/transaction=].

<aside class=note>
  Requests are not typically re-used, but there are exceptions. When a
  [=cursor=] is iterated, the success of the iteration is reported
  on the same [=/request=] object used to open the cursor. And when
  an [=/upgrade transaction=] is necessary, the same [=open
  request=] is used for both the <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a>
  event and final result of the open operation itself. In some cases,
  the request's [=request/done flag=] will be unset then set again, and the
  [=request/result=] can change or [=request/error=] could be set insead.
</aside>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
### Open Requests ### {#open-requests}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>open request</dfn> is a special type of [=/request=] used
when opening a [=/connection=] or deleting a [=database=].
In addition to <a event>`success`</a> and <a event>`error`</a> events,
<dfn event>`blocked`</dfn> and <dfn event>`upgradeneeded`</dfn> events may be fired at an [=open
request=] to indicate progress.

The [=request/source=] of an [=open request=]
is always null.

The [=request/transaction=] of an [=open request=] is null
unless an <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event has been fired.

An [=open request=]'s [=get the parent=] algorithm returns null.

[=Open requests=] are processed in a <dfn>connection queue</dfn>.
The queue contains all [=open requests=] associated with an
[=/origin=] and a [=database/name=]. Requests added to the
[=connection queue=] processed in order and each request must run
to completion before the next request is processed. An open request
may be blocked on other [=/connections=], requiring those
connections to [=connection/close=] before the request can complete and allow
further requests to be processed.

<aside class=note>
  A [=connection queue=] is not a [=task queue=] associated with

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Key Range ## {#range-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Records can be retrieved from [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=]
using either [=/keys=] or [=key ranges=]. A <dfn>key range</dfn> is a
continuous interval over some data type used for keys.

A [=key range=] has an associated <dfn>lower bound</dfn> (null or a
[=/key=]).

A [=key range=] has an associated <dfn>upper bound</dfn> (null or a
[=/key=]).

A [=key range=] has an associated <dfn>lower open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A [=key range=] has an associated <dfn>upper open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A [=key range=] may have a [=lower bound=] [=equal to=] its
[=upper bound=]. A [=key range=] must not have a [=lower
bound=] [=greater than=] its [=upper bound=].

A [=key range=] <dfn>containing only</dfn> |key| has both
[=lower bound=] and [=upper bound=] equal to |key|.

A |key| is <dfn lt="in">in a key range</dfn> if both of the following
conditions are fulfilled:

* The [=lower bound=] is null, or it is [=less than=]
    |key|, or it is both [=equal to=] |key| and
    the [=lower open flag=] is unset.

* The [=upper bound=] is null, or it is [=greater than=]
    |key|, or it is both [=equal to=] |key| and
    the [=upper open flag=] is unset.

<aside class=note>

  * If the [=lower open flag=] of a [=key range=] is unset, the
    [=lower bound=] [=/key=] of the [=key range=] is included
    in the range itself.

  * If the [=lower open flag=] of a [=key range=] is set, the
    [=lower bound=] [=/key=] of the [=key range=] is excluded
    from the range itself.

  * If the [=upper open flag=] of a [=key range=] is unset, the
    [=upper bound=] [=/key=] of the [=key range=] is included
    in the range itself.

  * If the [=upper open flag=] of a [=key range=] is set, the
    [=upper bound=] [=/key=] of the [=key range=] is excluded
    from the range itself.

</aside>

An <dfn>unbounded key range</dfn> is a [=key range=] that has both
[=lower bound=] and [=upper bound=] equal to null. All
[=/keys=] are [=in=] an [=unbounded key
range=].

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>convert a value to a key range</dfn> with
|value| and optional |null disallowed flag| are as
follows:

1. If |value| is a [=key range=], return |value|.

1. If |value| is undefined or is null, then [=throw=] a
    "{{DataError}}" {{DOMException}} if |null disallowed flag| is set, or return an
    [=unbounded key range=] otherwise.

1. Let |key| be the result of running the steps to [=convert
    a value to a key=] with |value|. Rethrow any exceptions.

1. If |key| is invalid, [=throw=] a "{{DataError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Return a [=key range=] [=containing only=] |key|.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Cursor ## {#cursor-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>cursor</dfn> is used to iterate over a range of records in an
[=/index=] or an [=/object store=] in a specific direction.

<div dfn-for=cursor>

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>transaction</dfn>, the [=/transaction=]
that was [=transaction/active=] when the cursor was created.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an
[=/index=] or an [=/object store=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>source</dfn> that indicates which [=/index=]
or an [=/object store=] is associated with the records over which
the [=cursor=] is iterating.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>direction</dfn> that determines whether it
moves in monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the
[=object-store/record=] keys when iterated, and if it skips duplicated values
when iterating indexes. The direction of a cursor also determines if
the cursor initial position is at the start of its
[=cursor/source=] or at its end. A cursor's
[=cursor/direction=] is one of the following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"next"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should yield all
    records, including duplicates, in monotonically increasing order
    of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"nextunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should not yield
    records with the same key, but otherwise yield all records, in
    monotonically increasing order of keys. For every key with
    duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the
    [=cursor/source=] is an [=/object store=] or an [=/index=] with
    the [=unique flag=] set, this direction has exactly the same
    behavior as {{"next"}}.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prev"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should yield all
    records, including duplicates, in monotonically decreasing order
    of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prevunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
    [=cursor/source=]. When iterated, the [=cursor=] should not
    yield records with the same key, but otherwise yield all records,
    in monotonically decreasing order of keys. For every key with
    duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the
    [=cursor/source=] is an [=/object store=] or an
    [=/index=] with the [=unique flag=] set, this direction
    has exactly the same behavior as {{"prev"}}.
  </dd>
</dl>

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>position</dfn> within its range. It is
possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
change before the full [=cursor/range=] of the cursor has been iterated.
In order to handle this, cursors maintain their [=cursor/position=] not as
an index, but rather as a [=/key=] of the previously returned
record. For a forward iterating cursor, the next time the cursor is
asked to iterate to the next record it returns the record with the
lowest [=/key=] [=greater than=] the one previously
returned. For a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite
and it returns the record with the highest [=/key=] [=less
than=] the one previously returned.

For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more
complicated since multiple records can have the same key and are
therefore also sorted by [=/value=]. When iterating indexes the
[=cursor=] also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which
indicates the [=/value=] of the previously found [=object-store/record=] in
the index. Both [=cursor/position=] and the [=object store position=]
are used when finding the next appropriate record.

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn> which
represent the [=/key=] and the [=/value=] of the last iterated
[=object-store/record=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>got value flag</dfn>. When this flag unset,
the cursor is either in the process of loading the next value or it
has reached the end of its [=cursor/range=]. When it is set, it indicates
that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to
iterate to the next one.

If the [=cursor/source=] of a cursor is an [=/object store=], the
<dfn>effective object store</dfn> of the cursor is that object store
and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the cursor's
[=cursor/position=]. If the [=cursor/source=] of a cursor is an [=/index=],
the [=effective object store=] of the cursor is that index's
[=referenced=] object store and the [=effective key=] is the cursor's
[=object store position=].

A [=cursor=] has a <dfn>request</dfn>, which is the [=/request=] used
to open the cursor.

A [=cursor=] also has a <dfn>key only flag</dfn>, that indicates
whether the cursor's [=cursor/value=] is exposed via the API. Unless
stated otherwise it is unset.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Key Generators ## {#key-generator-construct}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When a [=/object store=] is created it can be specified to use a
<dfn>key generator</dfn>. A key generator is used to generate keys
for records inserted into an object store if not otherwise specified.

<div dfn-for="key generator">

A [=key generator=] has a <dfn>current number</dfn>. The
[=key generator/current number=] is always a positive integer less
than or equal to 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) + 1. The initial value
of a [=key generator=]'s [=key generator/current number=] is 1, set
when the associated [=/object store=] is created. The
[=key generator/current number=] is incremented as keys are generated,
and may be updated to a specific value by using explicit keys.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  Every object store that uses key generators uses a separate
  generator. That is, interacting with one object store never affects
  the key generator of any other object store.
</aside>

Modifying a key generator's [=key generator/current number=] is considered part
of a database operation. This means that if the operation fails
and the operation is reverted, the [=key generator/current number=] is
reverted to the value it had before the operation started. This
applies both to modifications that happen due to the [=key generator/current
number=] getting increased by 1 when the key generator is used,
and to modifications that happen due to a [=object-store/record=] being
stored with a key value specified in the call to store the
[=object-store/record=].

Likewise, if a [=/transaction=] is aborted, the [=key generator/current
number=] of the key generator for each [=/object store=] in
the transaction's [=transaction/scope=] is reverted to the value it had
before the [=/transaction=] was started.

The [=key generator/current number=] for a key generator never decreases, other
than as a result of database operations being reverted. Deleting a
[=object-store/record=] from an [=/object store=] never affects the
object store's key generator. Even clearing all records from an
object store, for example using the {{IDBObjectStore/clear()}} method, does not
affect the [=key generator/current number=] of the object store's key
generator.

When a [=object-store/record=] is stored and a [=/key=] is not specified
in the call to store the record, a key is generated.

<div class=algorithm>

  To <dfn>generate a key</dfn> for an [=/object store=] |store|, run these steps:

  1. Let |generator| be the [=key generator=] associated with |store|.

  1. Let |key| be |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=].

  1. If |key| is greater than 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992), then return failure.

  1. Increase |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=] by 1.

  1. Return |key|.

</div>

When a [=object-store/record=] is stored and a [=/key=] is specified
in the call to store the record, the associated [=key generator=] may
be updated.

<div class=algorithm>

  To <dfn>possibly update the key generator</dfn> for an [=/object store=] |store| with |key|,
  run these steps:

  1. If the [=key/type=] of |key| is not *number*, abort these steps.

  1. Let |value| be the [=key/value=] of |key|.

  1. Let |value| be the minimum of |value| and 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992).

  1. Let |value| be the largest integer not greater than |value|.

  1. Let |generator| be the [=key generator=] associated with |store|.

  1. If |value| is greater than or equal to |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=],
      then set |generator|'s [=key generator/current number=] to |value| + 1.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  A key can be specified both for object stores which use
  [=in-line keys=], by setting the property on the stored value
  which the object store's [=object-store/key path=] points to,
  and for object stores which use [=out-of-line keys=], by passing
  a key argument to the call to store the [=object-store/record=].

  Only specified keys of [=key/type=] *number* can affect the
  [=key generator/current number=] of the key generator. Keys of [=key/type=]
  *date*, *array* (regardless of the other keys they
  contain), *binary*, or *string* (regardless of whether
  they could be parsed as numbers) have no effect on the [=key generator/current
  number=] of the key generator. Keys of [=key/type=]
  *number* with [=key/value=] less than 1 do not affect the
  [=key generator/current number=] since they are always lower than the
  [=key generator/current number=].
</aside>

When the [=key generator/current number=] of a key generator reaches above the
value 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) any subsequent attempts to use the
key generator to generate a new [=/key=] will result in a
"{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}. It is still possible to insert
[=object-store/records=] into the object store by specifying an explicit
key, however the only way to use a key generator again for such records
is to delete the object store and create a new one.

<aside class=note>
  This limit arises because integers greater than 9007199254740992
  cannot be uniquely represented as ECMAScript [=Numbers=].
  As an example, `9007199254740992 + 1 === 9007199254740992`
  in ECMAScript.

  As long as key generators are used in a normal fashion this limit will
  not be a problem. If you generate a new key 1000 times per
  second day and night, you won't run into this limit for over
  285000 years.
</aside>

A practical result of this is that the first key generated for an
object store is always 1 (unless a higher numeric key is inserted
first) and the key generated for an object store is always a positive
integer higher than the highest numeric key in the store. The same key
is never generated twice for the same object store unless a
transaction is rolled back.

<aside class=example id=example-key-generator>

Each object store gets its own key generator:

```js
store1 = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store2 = db.createObjectStore("store2", { autoIncrement: true });
store2.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store2.put("b"); // Will get key 2
```

If an insertion fails due to constraint violations or IO error, the
key generator is not updated.

```js
transaction.onerror = function(e) { e.preventDefault() };
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
index = store.createIndex("index1", "ix", { unique: true });
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will get key 1
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will fail
store.put({ ix: "b"}); // Will get key 2
```

Removing items from an objectStore never affects the key generator.
Including when {{IDBObjectStore/clear()}} is called.

```js
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.delete(1);
store.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store.clear();
store.put("c"); // Will get key 3
store.delete(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(0));
store.put("d"); // Will get key 4
```

Inserting an item with an explicit key affects the key generator if,
and only if, the key is numeric and higher than the last generated
key.

```js
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.put("b", 3); // Will use key 3
store.put("c"); // Will get key 4
store.put("d", -10); // Will use key -10
store.put("e"); // Will get key 5
store.put("f", 6.00001); // Will use key 6.0001
store.put("g"); // Will get key 7
store.put("f", 8.9999); // Will use key 8.9999
store.put("g"); // Will get key 9
store.put("h", "foo"); // Will use key "foo"
store.put("i"); // Will get key 10
store.put("j", [1000]); // Will use key [1000]
store.put("k"); // Will get key 11
// All of these would behave the same if the objectStore used a
// keyPath and the explicit key was passed inline in the object
```

Aborting a transaction rolls back any increases to the key generator
which happened during the transaction. This is to make all rollbacks
consistent since rollbacks that happen due to crash never has a chance
to commit the increased key generator value.

```js
db.createObjectStore("store", { autoIncrement: true });
trans1 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t1 = trans1.objectStore("store");
store_t1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store_t1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
trans1.abort();
trans2 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t2 = trans2.objectStore("store");
store_t2.put("c"); // Will get key 1
store_t2.put("d"); // Will get key 2
```
</aside>

<aside class=example id=example-inline-keygen>

The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying
to use in-line [=/keys=] and [=key generators=] to save an object
to an [=/object store=].

If the following conditions are true:

* The [=/object store=] has a [=key generator=].

* There is no in-line value for the [=object-store/key path=]
    property.

Then the value provided by the [=key generator=] is used to populate
the key value. In the example below the [=object-store/key path=] for
the object store is "`foo.bar`". The actual object has no
value for the `bar` property, `{ foo: {} }`.
When the object is saved in the [=/object store=] the `bar`
property is assigned a value of 1 because that is the next [=/key=]
generated by the [=key generator=].

```js
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
};
```

If the following conditions are true:

* The [=/object store=] has a [=key generator=].

* There is a value for the [=object-store/key path=]
    property.

Then the value associated with the [=object-store/key path=]
property is used. The auto-generated [=/key=] is not used. In the
example below the [=object-store/key path=] for the [=/object
store=] is "`foo.bar`". The actual object has a value of
10 for the `bar` property, `{ foo: { bar: 10}
}`. When the object is saved in the [=/object store=] the
`bar` property keeps its value of 10, because that is the
key value.

```js
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: { bar: 10 } }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 10);
};
```

The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified
in-line [=/key=] is defined through a [=object-store/key
path=] but there is no property matching it. The value provided by
the [=key generator=] is then used to populate the key value and
the system is responsible for creating as many properties as it
requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.
In the example below the [=object-store/key path=] for the
[=/object store=] is "`foo.bar.baz`". The actual
object has no value for the `foo` property, `{ zip: {}
}`. When the object is saved in the [=/object store=]
the `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`
properties are created each as a child of the other until a value for
`foo.bar.baz` can be assigned. The value for
`foo.bar.baz` is the next key generated by the object
store.

```js
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar.baz",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ zip: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
  store.get(key).onsuccess = function(e) {
    var value = e.target.result;
    // value will be: { zip: {}, foo: { bar: { baz: 1 } } }
    console.assert(value.foo.bar.baz === 1);
  };
};
```

Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and
throw an error. In the first example below the [=object-store/key
path=] for the object store is "`foo`". The actual object
is a primitive with the value, `4`. Trying to define a
property on that primitive value fails. The same is true for arrays.
Properties are not allowed on an array. In the second example below,
the actual object is an array, `[10]`. Trying to define a
property on the array fails.

```js
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo", autoIncrement: true });

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this primitive.
store.put(4); // will throw DataError

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this array.
store.put([10]); // will throw DataError
```

# API # {#async-api}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The API methods return without blocking the calling thread. All
asynchronous operations immediately return an {{IDBRequest}}
instance. This object does not initially contain any information about
the result of the operation. Once information becomes available, an
event is fired on the request and the information becomes available
through the properties of the {{IDBRequest}} instance.

The <span>task source</span> for these tasks is the <dfn export>database

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## The {{IDBRequest}} interface ## {#request-api}

The {{IDBRequest}} interface provides the means to access results of

Every method for making asynchronous requests returns an

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>result</dfn> attribute's getter must
[=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}} if the [=request/done flag=] is
unset. Otherwise, the attribute's getter must return the
[=request/result=] of the request, or undefined if the
request resulted in an error.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>error</dfn> attribute's getter must
[=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}} if the [=request/done flag=] is unset.
Otherwise, the attribute's getter must return the [=request/error=] of
the request, or null if no error occurred.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the [=request/source=] of the [=/request=], or null if no
[=request/source=] is set.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>transaction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the [=request/transaction=] of the [=/request=]. This
property can be null for certain requests, such as for [=/requests=]
returned from {{IDBFactory/open()}}.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>readyState</dfn> attribute's getter
must return {{"pending"}} if the [=request/done flag=] is unset, and
{{"done"}} otherwise.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>onsuccess</dfn> attribute is the
event handler for the <a event>`success`</a> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>onerror</dfn> attribute is the event
handler for the <a event>`error`</a> event.


Methods on {{IDBDatabase}} that return a [=open request=] use an
extended interface to allow listening to the
<a event>`blocked`</a> and <a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> events.

<xmp class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBOpenDBRequest : IDBRequest {
  // Event handlers:
  attribute EventHandler onblocked;
  attribute EventHandler onupgradeneeded;
};
</xmp>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onblocked</dfn> attribute is
the event handler for the <a event>`blocked`</a> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onupgradeneeded</dfn>
attribute is the event handler for the
<a event>`upgradeneeded`</a> event.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Event interfaces ## {#events}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification fires events with the following custom interfaces:

<xmp class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker),
 Constructor(DOMString type, optional IDBVersionChangeEventInit eventInitDict)]
interface IDBVersionChangeEvent : Event {
  readonly attribute unsigned long long oldVersion;
  readonly attribute unsigned long long? newVersion;
};

dictionary IDBVersionChangeEventInit : EventInit {
  unsigned long long oldVersion = 0;
  unsigned long long? newVersion = null;
};
</xmp>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>oldVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the previous version of the database.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>newVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the new version of the database, or null if
the database is being deleted. See the steps to [=run an upgrade
transaction=].

Events are constructed as defined in [[DOM#constructing-events]].

<div class=algorithm>

  To <dfn>fire a version change event</dfn> named |e| at |target| given
  |oldVersion| and |newVersion|, run these steps:

  1. Let |event| be the result of [=creating an event=] using
      {{IDBVersionChangeEvent}}.
  1. Set |event|'s {{Event/type}} attribute to |e|.
  1. Set |event|'s {{Event/bubbles}} and {{Event/cancelable}} attributes to false.
  1. Set |event|'s {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/oldVersion}} attribute to |oldVersion|.
  1. Set |event|'s {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/newVersion}} attribute to |newVersion|.
  1. Let |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag| be unset.
  1. [=Dispatch=] |event| at |target| with |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag|.
  1. Return |legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag|.

The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>createObjectStore(|name|,

1. If an [=/object store=] [=object-store/named=] |name| already
    exists in |database| [=throw=] a "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Let |autoIncrement| be set if |options|'s

1. Let |store| be a new [=/object store=] in

</div>

This method creates and returns a new [=/object store=] with the given
name in the [=connected=] [=database=]. Note that this method must
only be called from within an [=/upgrade transaction=].

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to run
into problems after queuing a task to create the [=/object store=]
after the {{createObjectStore()}} method has returned. For example in
implementations where metadata about the newly created [=/object
store=] is inserted into the database asynchronously, or where the
implementation might need to ask the user for permission for quota
reasons. Such implementations must still create and return an
{{IDBObjectStore}} object, and once the implementation determines that
creating the [=/object store=] has failed, it must abort the
transaction using the steps to [=abort a transaction=] using the
appropriate error. For example if creating the [=/object store=]
failed due to quota reasons, a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}} must be used as
error.

The <dfn method for=IDBObjectStore>get(|query|)</dfn> method, when
invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |transaction| be this [=/object store handle=]'s
    [=object-store-handle/transaction=].

1. Let |store| be this [=/object store handle=]'s
    [=object-store-handle/object store=].

1. If |store| has been deleted, [=throw=] an
    "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. If |transaction| is not [=transaction/active=], [=throw=] a

1. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to
    [=convert a value to a key range=] with |query| and
    |null disallowed flag| set. Rethrow any exceptions.

1. Run the steps to [=asynchronously execute a request=] and
      return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps
      are run with this [=/object store handle=] as
      |source| and the steps to [=retrieve a value from
      an object store=] as |operation|, using the

      |store| and |range|.

</div>

The |query| parameter may be a [=/key=] or an
{{IDBKeyRange}} identifying the [=object-store/record=] to be retrieved. If a
range is specified, the method retrieves the first existing value in
that range.

<aside class=note>
  This method produces the same result if a record with the given key
  doesn't exist as when a record exists, but has `undefined` as value.
  If you need to tell the two situations apart, you can use
  {{IDBObjectStore/openCursor()}} with the same key. This will return
  a cursor with `undefined` as value if a record exists, or no cursor if
  no such record exists.

</div>

This method creates and returns a new [=/index=] with the
given name in the [=/object store=]. Note that this method
must only be called from within an [=/upgrade transaction=].

The index that is requested to be created can contain constraints on
the data allowed in the index's [=referenced=] object store, such
as requiring uniqueness of the values referenced by the index's
[=index/key path=]. If the [=referenced=] object store already contains data
which violates these constraints, this must not cause the
implementation of {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} to throw an
exception or affect what it returns. The implementation must still
create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object, and the implementation must
[=queue a task=] to abort the [=/upgrade transaction=] which was
used for the {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} call.

This method synchronously modifies the {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}}
property on the {{IDBObjectStore}} instance on which it was called.
Although this method does not return an {{IDBRequest}} object, the
index creation itself is processed as an asynchronous request within
the [=/upgrade transaction=].

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to
asynchronously run into problems creating the index after the
createIndex method has returned. For example in implementations where
metadata about the newly created index is queued up to be inserted
into the database asynchronously, or where the implementation might
need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons. Such
implementations must still create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object,
and once the implementation determines that creating the index has
failed, it must abort the transaction using the steps to [=abort
a transaction=] using an appropriate error as |error|. For example
if creating the [=/index=] failed due to quota reasons,
a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}} must be used as error and if the index can't be
created due to [=unique flag=] constraints, a "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}
must be used as error.

<aside class=example id=example-async-index-creation>

  The asynchronous creation of indexes is observable in the following example:

```js
    var request1 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 1);
    var request2 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 2);
    var index = objectStore.createIndex("by_name", "name", {unique: true});
```

  At the point where {{createIndex()}} called, neither of the
  [=/requests=] have executed. When the second request executes, a
  duplicate name is created. Since the index creation is considered an
  asynchronous [=/request=], the index's <a data-lt="unique
  flag">uniqueness constraint</a> does not cause the second
  [=/request=] to fail. Instead, the [=/transaction=] will
  be [=transaction/aborted=] when the index is created and the constraint
  fails.

[=object-store/key path=]. The [=/key path=] is converted as a
{{DOMString}} (if a string) or a [=sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;=] (if a
list of strings), per [[!WEBIDL]].

The returned value is not the same instance that was used when the
[=/index=] was created. However, if this attribute returns an
object (specifically an [=Array=]), it returns the same object
instance every time it is inspected. Changing the properties of the
object has no effect on the [=/index=].

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>multiEntry</dfn> attribute's getter
must return true if this [=index handle=]'s
[=index-handle/index=]'s [=multiEntry flag=] is set, and false
otherwise.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>unique</dfn> attribute's getter must
return true if this [=index handle=]'s
[=index-handle/index=]'s [=unique flag=] is set, and false
otherwise.

<div class=algorithm>

The <dfn method for=IDBIndex>get(|query|)</dfn> method, when invoked,
must run these steps:

1. Let |transaction| be this [=index handle=]'s
    [=index-handle/transaction=].

1. Let |index| be this [=index handle=]'s
    [=index-handle/index=].

1. If |index| or |index|'s [=/object store=] has
    been deleted, [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. If |transaction| is not [=transaction/active=], [=throw=] a
    "{{TransactionInactiveError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to
    [=convert a value to a key range=] with |query| and
    |null disallowed flag| set. Rethrow any exceptions.

1. Run the steps to [=asynchronously execute a request=] and
      return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps
      are run with this [=index handle=] as |source| and
      the steps to [=retrieve a referenced value from an index=]
      as |operation|, using the [=current Realm=] as |targetRealm|,
      |index| and |range|.

</div>

The |query| parameter may be a [=/key=] or an
{{IDBKeyRange}} identifying the [=object-store/record=] to be retrieved. If a
range is specified, the method retrieves the first existing record in
that range.


<aside class=note>
  This method produces the same result if a record with the given key
  doesn't exist as when a record exists, but has `undefined` as value.
  If you need to tell the two situations apart, you can use
  {{IDBIndex/openCursor()}} with the same key. This will return a
  cursor with `undefined` as value if a record exists, or no cursor if
  no such record exists.

The |query| parameter may be a [=/key=] or an {{IDBKeyRange}}
identifying the [=object-store/records=] to be retrieved. If null or not given,
an [=unbounded key range=] is used. If |count| is specified and
there are more than |count| records in range, only the first |count|
will be retrieved.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the [=cursor/source=] of this [=cursor=]. This
attribute never returns null or throws an exception, even if the
cursor is currently being iterated, has iterated past its end, or its
[=/transaction=] is not [=transaction/active=].

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>direction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the [=cursor/direction=] of the [=cursor=].

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>key</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the result of running the steps to [=convert a key to a
value=] with the cursor's current [=cursor/key=]. Note that
if this property returns an object (e.g. a [=Date=] or
[=Array=]), it returns the same object instance every time it is
inspected, until the cursor's [=cursor/key=] is changed. This
means that if the object is modified, those modifications will be seen
by anyone inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such
an object does not modify the contents of the database.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>primaryKey</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the result of running the steps to [=convert a key to a
value=] with the cursor's current [=effective key=]. Note that if
this property returns an object (e.g. a [=Date=] or [=Array=]),
it returns the same object instance every time it is inspected, until
the cursor's [=effective key=] is changed. This means that if the
object is modified, those modifications will be seen by anyone
inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such an object
does not modify the contents of the database.

<div class=note>
  The following methods advance a [=cursor=]. Once the cursor has
  advanced, a <a event>`success`</a> event will be fired at the
  same {{IDBRequest}} returned when the cursor was opened. The
  {{IDBRequest/result}} will be the same cursor if a [=object-store/record=] was
  in range, or `undefined` otherwise.

  If called while the cursor is already advancing, an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}
  will be thrown.

  The following methods throw a "{{TransactionInactiveError}}" {{DOMException}} if called

## Opening a database ## {#opening}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>open a database</dfn> are as follows.
The algorithm in these steps takes four arguments:
the |origin| which requested the [=database=] to be opened, a
database |name|, a database |version|, and a |request|.

1. Let |queue| be the [=connection queue=] for |origin| and |name|.

1. Add |request| to |queue|.

1. Wait until all previous requests in |queue| have been processed.

1. Let |db| be the [=database=] [=database/named=] |name| in
    |origin|, or null otherwise.

1. If |version| is undefined, let |version| be 1 if |db| is null, or
    |db|'s [=database/version=] otherwise.

1. If |db| is null, let |db| be a new [=database=] with
    [=database/name=] |name|, [=database/version=] 0 (zero), and with
    no [=/object stores=]. If this fails for any reason, return an
    appropriate error (e.g. a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" or
    "{{UnknownError}}" {{DOMException}}).

1. If |db|'s [=database/version=] is greater than |version|,
    return a newly [=exception/created=] "{{VersionError}}" {{DOMException}}
    and abort these steps.

1. Let |connection| be a new [=/connection=] to |db|.

1. Set |connection|'s [=connection/version=] to |version|.

1. If |db|'s [=database/version=] is less than |version|, then:

    1. Let |openConnections| be the set of all [=/connections=],
        except |connection|, associated with |db|.

    1. For each |entry| in |openConnections| that does not have its
        [=close pending flag=] set, [=queue a task=] to [=fire a
        version change event=] named <a event>`versionchange`</a> at
        |entry| with |db|'s [=database/version=] and |version|.

        <aside class=note>
          Firing this event might cause one or more of the other
          objects in |openConnections| to be closed, in which case the
          <a event>`versionchange`</a> event is not fired at those
          objects, even if that hasn't yet been done.
        </aside>

## Closing a database ## {#closing-connection}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>close a database connection</dfn> are as follows.
These steps take two arguments, a |connection| object, and an
optional |forced flag|.

1. Set |connection|'s [=close pending flag=].

1. If the |forced flag| is set, then for each |transaction|
    [=transaction/created=] using |connection| run the steps to [=abort a
    transaction=] with |transaction| and newly <a for=exception>created</a>
    "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. Wait for all transactions [=transaction/created=] using |connection| to complete.
    Once they are complete, |connection| is [=connection/closed=].

1. If the |forced flag| is set, then [=fire an event=] named
    <a event>`close`</a> at |connection|.

    <aside class=note>
      The <a event>`close`</a> event only fires if the connection closes
      abnormally, e.g. if the origin's storage is cleared, or there is
      corruption or an I/O error. If {{IDBDatabase/close()}} is called explicitly
      the event *does not* fire.
    </aside>

</div>

<aside class=note>
  Once the [=close pending flag=] has been set no new transactions

  [=transaction/create=] transactions first check the [=close pending flag=]
  first and throw an exception if it is set.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Deleting a database ## {#deleting-a-database}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>delete a database</dfn> are as follows. The
algorithm in these steps takes three arguments: the |origin| that
requested the [=database=] to be deleted, a database |name|, and a
|request|.

1. Let |queue| be the [=connection queue=] for |origin| and |name|.

1. Add |request| to |queue|.

1. Wait until all previous requests in |queue| have been processed.

1. Let |db| be the [=database=] [=database/named=] |name| in
    |origin|, if one exists. Otherwise, return 0 (zero).

1. Let |openConnections| be the set of all [=/connections=]
    associated with |db|.

1. For each |entry| in |openConnections| that does not have its
    [=close pending flag=] set, [=queue a task=] to [=fire a version
    change event=] named <a event>`versionchange`</a> at |entry| with
    |db|'s [=database/version=] and null.

    <aside class=note>
      Firing this event might cause one or more of the other objects
      in |openConnections| to be closed, in which case the
      <a event>`versionchange`</a> event is not fired at those
      objects, even if that hasn't yet been done.
    </aside>

1. Wait for all of the events to be fired.

1. If any of the [=/connections=] in |openConnections| are still not
    closed, [=queue a task=] to [=fire a version change event=] named

    [=database/version=] and null.

1. <span id="delete-close-block">Wait</span> until all

<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Committing a transaction ## {#commit-transaction}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>commit a transaction</dfn> are as follows.
This algorithm takes one argument, the |transaction| to commit.

1. All the changes made to the [=database=] by |transaction| are
    written to the [=database=].

1. If an error occurs while writing the changes to the
    [=database=], abort the transaction by following the steps
    to [=abort a transaction=] with |transaction| and an
    appropriate for the error, for example "{{QuotaExceededError}}" or
    "{{UnknownError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. [=Queue a task=] to run these steps:

    1. If |transaction| is an [=/upgrade transaction=], set the
        [=database=]'s [=database/upgrade transaction=] to null.

    1. [=Fire an event=] named <a event>`complete`</a> at |transaction|.

        <aside class=note>
          Even if an exception is thrown from one of the event handlers of
          this event, the transaction is still committed since writing the
          database changes happens before the event takes places. Only
          after the transaction has been successfully written is the
          <a event>`complete`</a> event fired.
        </aside>

    1. If |transaction| is an [=/upgrade transaction=], then
        let |request| be the [=/request=] associated with |transaction|
        and set |request|'s [=request/transaction=] to null.

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
## Aborting a transaction ## {#abort-transaction}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>abort a transaction</dfn> are as follows.
This algorithm
takes two arguments: the |transaction| to abort, and |error|.

1. All the changes made to the [=database=] by the [=/transaction=]
    are reverted. For [=/upgrade transactions=] this includes changes
    to the set of [=/object stores=] and [=/indexes=], as well as the
    change to the [=database/version=]. Any [=/object stores=] and
    [=/indexes=] which were created during the transaction are now
    considered deleted for the purposes of other algorithms.

1. If |transaction| is an [=/upgrade transaction=], run the steps
    to [=abort an upgrade transaction=] with |transaction|.

    <aside class=note>
      This reverts changes to all [=/connection=], [=/object store
      handle=], and [=index handle=] instances associated with
      |transaction|.
    </aside>

1. If |error| is not null, set |transaction|'s
    [=transaction/error=] to |error|.

1. For each |request| in |transaction|'s [=request list=] with
    [=request/done flag=] unset, abort the steps to [=asynchronously
    execute a request=] for |request| and [=queue a task=] to
    run these steps:

    1. Set |request|'s [=request/done flag=].
    1. Set |request|'s [=request/result=] to undefined.
    1. Set |request|'s [=request/error=] to a newly
        <a for=exception>created</a> "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}}.
    1. [=Fire an event=] named <a event>`error`</a> at |request|
        with its {{Event/bubbles}} and {{Event/cancelable}}
        attributes initialized to true.

    <aside class=note>
      This does not always result in any <a event>`error`</a> events
      being fired. For example if a transaction is aborted due to an
      error while [=transaction/committing=] the transaction,
      or if it was the last remaining request that failed.
    </aside>

1. [=Queue a task=] to run these steps:

    1. If |transaction| is an [=/upgrade transaction=], set the
        [=database=]'s [=database/upgrade transaction=] to null.

    1. [=Fire an event=] named <a event>`abort`</a> at |transaction|
        with its {{Event/bubbles}} attribute initialized to true.

    1. If |transaction| is an [=/upgrade transaction=], then:

        1. Let |request| be the [=request/open request=] associated with |transaction|.
        1. Set |request|'s [=request/transaction=] to null.
        1. Set |request|'s [=request/result=] to undefined.
        1. Unset |request|'s [=request/done flag=].

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>asynchronously execute a request</dfn> are as follows.

database, and an optional |request|.

These steps can be aborted at any point if the [=/transaction=] the
created [=/request=] belongs to is [=transaction/aborted=] using the steps to
[=abort a transaction=].

1. Let |transaction| be the [=/transaction=] associated with
    |source|.

1. Assert: |transaction| is [=transaction/active=].

1. If |request| was not given, let |request| be a new |request| with
    [=request/source=] as |source|.

1. Add |request| to the end of |transaction|'s [=request list=].

1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:

    1. Wait until all previously added [=/requests=] in |transaction|
        have their [=request/done flag=] set.

    1. Let |result| be the result of performing |operation|.

    1. If |result| is an error, then revert all changes made by
        |operation|.

        <aside class=note>
          This only reverts the changes done by this request, not any
          other changes made by the transaction.
        </aside>

    1. [=Queue a task=] to run these steps:

        1. Set |request|'s [=request/done flag=].

        1. If |result| is an error, then:

            1. Set |request|'s [=request/result=] to undefined.
            1. Set |request|'s [=request/error=] to |result|.
            1. [=Fire an error event=] at |request|.

        1. Otherwise:

1. Let |db| be |connection|'s [=database=].

1. Let |transaction| be a new [=/upgrade transaction=] with

1. Set |database|'s [=database/upgrade transaction=] to |transaction|.

1. Unset |transaction|'s [=transaction/active flag=].

1. Start |transaction|.

follows.

1. If |store| uses a [=key generator=], then:

    1. If |key| is undefined, then:

        1. Let |key| be the result of running the steps to
            [=generate a key=] for |store|.

            "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}. Abort this
            algorithm without taking any further steps.

        1. If |store| also uses [=in-line keys=], then run the
            steps to [=inject a key into a value using a key path=]
            with |value|, |key| and |store|'s [=object-store/key
            path=].

    1. Otherwise, run the steps to [=possibly update the key generator=]
        for |store| with |key|.

1. If the |no-overwrite flag| was given to these steps and is set, and
    a [=object-store/record=] already exists in |store| with its key [=equal to=]
    |key|, then this operation failed with a "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}.
    Abort this algorithm without taking any further steps.

1. If a [=object-store/record=] already exists in |store| with its key [=equal
    to=] |key|, then remove the [=object-store/record=] from |store| using the
    steps to [=delete records from an object store=].

1. Store a record in |store| containing |key| as its key and
    [=!=] <a abstract-op>StructuredSerializeForStorage</a>(|value|)
    as its value. The record is stored in the object store's
    [=object-store/list of records=] such that the list is sorted

1. For each |index| which [=reference=] |store|:

        |value|, |index|'s [=index/key path=], and |index|'s
        [=multiEntry flag=].

    1. If |index key| is an exception, or invalid, or failure, take no
        further actions for |index|, and continue these steps
        for the next index.

        <aside class=note>

        [=object-store/record=] with [=/key=] [=equal to=] |index
        key|, and |index| has its [=unique flag=] set, then this
        operation failed with a "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}. Abort this
        algorithm without taking any further steps.

    1. If |index|'s [=multiEntry flag=] is set and |index key| is
        an [=array key=], and if |index| already contains a
        [=object-store/record=] with [=/key=] [=equal to=] any of the
        [=subkeys=] of |index key|, and |index| has its [=unique
        flag=] set, then this operation failed with a
        "{{ConstraintError}}" {{DOMException}}. Abort this algorithm without taking any
        further steps.

    1. If |index|'s [=multiEntry flag=] is unset, or if |index key|
        is not an [=array key=] then store a record in |index|
        containing |index key| as its key and |key| as its value. The
        record is stored in |index|'s [=index/list of records=]
        such that the list is sorted primarily on the records keys,
        and secondarily on the records values, in [=ascending=] order.

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>convert a value to a key</dfn> are as follows. These
steps take two arguments, an ECMAScript value |input|, and an optional
set |seen|. The result of these steps is a [=/key=] or invalid, or the
steps may throw an exception.

1. If |seen| was not given, let |seen| be a new empty set.

1. If |input| is in |seen| return invalid.

1. Jump to the appropriate step below:

    <dl class=switch>

      <!-- Number -->
      <dt>If [=/Type=](|input|) is Number</dt>
      <dd>
        1. If |input| is NaN then return invalid.

            1. Let |hop| be [=?=] [=HasOwnProperty=](|input|, |index|).

            1. If |hop| is false, return invalid.

            1. Let |entry| be [=?=] [=Get=](|input|, |index|).

            1. Let |key| be the result of running the steps to

<div class=algorithm>

The steps to <dfn>convert a value to a multiEntry key</dfn> are as
follows. These steps take one argument, an ECMAScript value |input|.
The result of these steps is a [=/key=] or invalid, or the
steps may throw an exception.

1. If [=IsArray=](|input|), then:

    1. Let |len| be [=?=] ToLength( [=?=] [=Get=](|input|, "`length`")).

    1. Let |seen| be a new set containing only |input|.

    1. Let |keys| be a new empty set.

    1. Let |index| be 0.

    1. While |index| is less than |len|:

        1. Let |entry| be [=Get=](|input|, |index|).

        1. If |entry| is not an [=abrupt completion=], then:

                 [=convert a value to a key=] with arguments
                 |entry| and |seen|.

             1. If |key| is not invalid or an [=abrupt completion=],
                 add |key| to |keys| if there are no other members of
                 |keys| [=equal to=] |key|.

        1. Increase |index| by 1.

    1. Return a new [=array key=] with [=key/value=] set to
        a list of the members of |keys|.

1. Otherwise, return the result of running the steps to [=convert a
    value to a key=] with argument |input|.
    Rethrow any exceptions.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  These steps are similar to those to [=convert a value to a key=]
  but if the top-level value is an [=Array=] then members which can
  not be converted to keys are ignored, and duplicates are removed.

  For example, the value `[10, 20, null, 30, 20]` is
  converted to an [=array key=] with [=subkeys=] 10, 20, 30.

# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## User tracking ## {#user-tracking}

A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier stored in
its client-side database to track a user across multiple sessions,
building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction with a
site that is aware of the user's real id object (for example an
e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could
allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy
than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk
of user tracking:


<dl>
<dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
<dd>
User agents may restrict access to the database objects
to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
the API for pages from other domains running in `iframe`s.
</dd>

<dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents may automatically delete stored data after a period of
time.

This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the site
would then only be able to track the user across multiple sessions
when she authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by making a purchase
or logging in to a service).

However, this also puts the user's data at risk.
</dd>

<dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
<dd>

User agents should present the database feature to the user in a way
that associates them strongly with HTTP session cookies. [[COOKIES]]

This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
suspicion.

</dd>

<dt>Site-specific safe-listing of access to databases</dt>
<dd>

User agents may require the user to authorize access to databases
before a site can use the feature.

</dd>

<dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents may record the [=/origins=] of sites that contained content
from third-party origins that caused data to be stored.

If this information is then used to present the view of data
currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
prune. Combined with a blocklist ("delete this data and prevent
this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
the use of persistent storage to sites that she trusts.

</dd>

<dt>Shared blocklists</dt>
<dd>

User agents may allow users to share their persistent storage
domain blocklists.

This would allow communities to act together to protect their
privacy.

</dd>
</dl>

While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
pass all this information to the third party along with any
identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
created.

However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
sites, using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
separate sessions into coherent user profiles.


## Cookie resurrection ## {#cookie-resurrection}

If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
persistent storage features described in this specification separately
from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely to delete
data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to use the two
features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a user's
attempts to protect his privacy.


## Sensitivity of data ## {#sensitivity-of-data}

User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
mechanism.

To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.

# Security Considerations # {#security}
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## DNS spoofing attacks ## {#dns-spoofing-attacks}

Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use TLS. Pages using TLS
can be sure that only pages using TLS that have certificates
identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
databases.


## Cross-directory attacks ## {#cross-directory-attacks}

Different authors sharing one host name, for example users hosting
content on `geocities.com`, all share one set of databases.

There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these features,
as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data and
overwrite it.

<aside class=note>
  Even if a path-restriction feature was made available, the usual DOM
  scripting security model would make it trivial to bypass this
  protection and access the data from any path.
</aside>

## Implementation risks ## {#implementation-risks}

The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
features are letting hostile sites read information from other
domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then read
from other domains.

Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be read
from their domain causes *information leakage*, For example, a
user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by another
domain for targeted advertising; or a user's work-in-progress
confidential documents stored by a word-processing site could be
examined by the site of a competing company.

Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
other domains can result in *information spoofing*, which is
equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
the user's actions on the victim site.

Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described in
this specification is important for user security.

If origins or database names are used to construct paths for
persistence to a file system they must be appropriately escaped to
prevent an adversary from accessing information from other origins
using relative paths such as "`../`".

## Persistence risks ## {#persistence-risks}

Practical implementations will persist data to a non-volatile storage
medium. Data will be serialized when stored and deserialized when
retrieved, although the details of the serialization format will be
user-agent specific. User agents are likely to change their
serialization format over time. For example, the format may be updated
to handle new data types, or to improve performance. To satisfy the
operational requirements of this specification, implementations must
therefore handle older serialization formats in some way. Improper
handling of older data can result in security issues. In addition to
basic serialization concerns, serialized data could encode assumptions
which are not valid in newer versions of the user agent.

A practical example of this is the [=RegExp=] type. The <a
abstract-op>StructuredSerializeForStorage</a> operation allows serializing [=RegExp=]
objects. A typical user agent will compile a regular expression into
native machine instructions, with assumptions about how the input data
is passed and results returned. If this internal state was serialized
as part of the data stored to the database, various problems could
arise when the internal representation was later deserialized. For
example, the means by which data was passed into the code could have
changed. Security bugs in the compiler output could have been
identified and fixed in updates to the user agent, but remain in the
serialized internal state.

User agents must identify and handle older data appropriately. One
approach is to include version identifiers in the serialization
format, and to reconstruct any internal state from script-visible
state when older data is encountered.
