Abstract: This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications,
  as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data. This includes:

  * A {{FileList}} interface, which represents an array of individually selected files from the underlying system. The user interface for selection can be invoked via <code>&lt;input type="file"></code>, i.e. when the input element is in the <code>File Upload</code> state [[HTML]].
  * A {{Blob}} interface, which represents immutable raw binary data, and allows access to ranges of bytes within the {{Blob}} object as a separate {{Blob}}.
  * A {{File}} interface, which includes readonly informational attributes about a file such as its name and the date of the last modification (on disk) of the file.
  * A {{FileReader}} interface, which provides methods to read a {{File}} or a {{Blob}}, and an event model to obtain the results of these reads.
  * A <a section href="#url">URL scheme</a> for use with binary data such as files, so that they can be referenced within web applications.

  Additionally, this specification defines objects to be used within threaded web applications for the synchronous reading of files.

  [[#requirements]] covers the motivation behind this specification.

  This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably:
  {{XMLHttpRequest}} (e.g. with an overloaded {{XMLHttpRequest/send()}} method for {{File}} or {{Blob}} arguments),
  {{Worker/postMessage()}},
  {{DataTransfer}} (part of the drag and drop API defined in [[HTML]])
  and Web Workers.
  Additionally, it should be possible to programmatically obtain a list of files from the <{input}> element
  when it is in the <code>File Upload</code> state [[HTML]].
  These kinds of behaviors are defined in the appropriate affiliated specifications.
Status Text: Previous discussion of this specification has taken place on two other mailing lists: <a href="mailto:public-webapps@w3.org">public-webapps@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/">archive</a>) and <a href="mailto:public-webapi@w3.org">public-webapi@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/">archive</a>). Ongoing discussion will be on the <a href="mailto:public-webapps@w3.org">public-webapps@w3.org</a> mailing list.

  This draft consists of changes made to the previous Last Call Working Draft. Please send comments to the <a href="mailto:public-webapi@w3.org">public-webapi@w3.org</a> as described above.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

*This section is informative.*

Web applications should have the ability to manipulate as wide as possible a range of user input,
including files that a user may wish to upload to a remote server or manipulate inside a rich web application.
This specification defines the basic representations for files,
lists of files,
errors raised by access to files,
and programmatic ways to read files.
Additionally, this specification also defines an interface that represents "raw data"
which can be asynchronously processed on the main thread of conforming user agents.
The interfaces and API defined in this specification can be used with other interfaces and APIs exposed to the web platform.

The {{File}} interface represents file data typically obtained from the underlying file system,
and the {{Blob}} interface
("Binary Large Object" - a name originally introduced to web APIs in <a href="https://developers.google.com/gears/?csw=1">Google Gears</a>)
represents immutable raw data.
{{File}} or {{Blob}} reads should happen asynchronously on the main thread,
with an optional synchronous API used within threaded web applications.
An asynchronous API for reading files prevents blocking and UI "freezing" on a user agent's main thread.
This specification defines an asynchronous API based on an *event model*
to read and access a {{File}} or {{Blob}}’s data.
A {{FileReader}} object provides asynchronous read methods to access that file's data
through event handler content attributes and the firing of events.
The use of events and event handlers allows separate code blocks the ability
to monitor the *progress of the read*
(which is particularly useful for remote drives or mounted drives,
  where file access performance may vary from local drives)
and error conditions that may arise during reading of a file.
An example will be illustrative.

<div class="example">
  In the example below, different code blocks handle progress, error, and success conditions.

  <pre highlight="js">
  function startRead() {
    // obtain input element through DOM

    var file = document.getElementById('file').files[0];
    if(file){
      getAsText(file);
    }
  }

  function getAsText(readFile) {

    var reader = new FileReader();

    // Read file into memory as UTF-16
    reader.readAsText(readFile, "UTF-16");

    // Handle progress, success, and errors
    reader.onprogress = updateProgress;
    reader.onload = loaded;
    reader.onerror = errorHandler;
  }

  function updateProgress(evt) {
    if (evt.lengthComputable) {
      // evt.loaded and evt.total are ProgressEvent properties
      var loaded = (evt.loaded / evt.total);
      if (loaded &lt; 1) {
        // Increase the prog bar length
        // style.width = (loaded * 200) + "px";
      }
    }
  }

  function loaded(evt) {
    // Obtain the read file data
    var fileString = evt.target.result;
    // Handle UTF-16 file dump
    if(utils.regexp.isChinese(fileString)) {
      //Chinese Characters + Name validation
    }
    else {
      // run other charset test
    }
    // xhr.send(fileString)
  }

  function errorHandler(evt) {
    if(evt.target.error.name == "NotReadableError") {
      // The file could not be read
    }
  }
  </pre>
</div>

<h2 id="terminology">
Terminology and Algorithms</h2>

When this specification says to <dfn id="terminate-an-algorithm" lt="terminate an algorithm|terminate this algorithm">terminate an algorithm</dfn>
the user agent must terminate the algorithm after finishing the step it is on.
Asynchronous <a>read methods</a> defined in this specification may return before the algorithm in question is terminated,
and can be terminated by an {{FileReader/abort()}} call.

The algorithms and steps in this specification use the following mathematical operations:

* max(a,b) returns the maximum of a and b,
  and is always performed on integers as they are defined in WebIDL [[WebIDL]];
  in the case of max(6,4) the result is 6.
  This operation is also defined in ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]].
* min(a,b) returns the minimum of a and b,
  and is always performed on integers as they are defined in WebIDL [[WebIDL]];
  in the case of min(6,4) the result is 4.
  This operation is also defined in ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]].
* Mathematical comparisons such as &lt; (less than), ≤ (less than or equal to), and > (greater than) are as in ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]].

The term <dfn id="UnixEpoch">Unix Epoch</dfn> is used in this specification to refer to the time 00:00:00 UTC on January 1 1970
(or 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ISO 8601);
this is the same time that is conceptually "<code>0</code>" in ECMA-262 [[ECMA-262]].

<h2 id="blob-section">
The Blob Interface and Binary Data</h2>

A {{Blob}} object refers to a <a>byte</a> sequence,
and has a {{Blob/size}} attribute which is the total number of bytes in the byte sequence,
and a {{Blob/type}} attribute,
which is an ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the <a>byte</a> sequence.

Each {{Blob}} must have an internal <dfn id="snapshot-state" for=Blob>snapshot state</dfn>,
which must be initially set to the state of the underlying storage,
if any such underlying storage exists.
Further normative definition of <a>snapshot state</a> can be found for {{File}}s.

<pre class="idl">
[Constructor(optional sequence&lt;BlobPart> blobParts,
             optional BlobPropertyBag options),
 Exposed=(Window,Worker), Serializable]
interface Blob {

  readonly attribute unsigned long long size;
  readonly attribute DOMString type;

  // slice Blob into byte-ranged chunks
  Blob slice([Clamp] optional long long start,
            [Clamp] optional long long end,
            optional DOMString contentType);
};

enum EndingType { "transparent", "native" };

dictionary BlobPropertyBag {
  DOMString type = "";
  EndingType endings = "transparent";
};

typedef (BufferSource or Blob or USVString) BlobPart;
</pre>

{{Blob}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=],
given |value| and |serialized|, are:

1. Set |serialized|.\[[SnapshotState]] to |value|'s [=snapshot state=].

2. Set |serialized|.\[[ByteSequence]] to |value|'s underlying byte sequence.

Their [=deserialization step=], given |serialized| and |value|, are:

1. Set |value|'s [=snapshot state=] to |serialized|.\[[SnapshotState]].

2. Set |value|'s underlying byte sequence to |serialized|.\[[ByteSequence]].

<h3 id="constructorBlob">
Constructors</h3>

<div algorithm="blob-constructor">
The {{Blob()}} constructor can be invoked with zero or more parameters.
When the {{Blob()}} constructor is invoked,
user agents must run the following steps:

1. If invoked with zero parameters,
  return a new {{Blob}} object consisting of 0 bytes,
  with {{Blob/size}} set to 0,
  and with {{Blob/type}} set to the empty string.

1. Let |bytes| be the result of [=processing blob parts=] given {{blobParts}} and {{Blob/Blob(blobParts, options)/options}}.

1. If the {{BlobPropertyBag/type}} member of the optional {{Blob/Blob(blobParts, options)/options}} argument is provided
  and is not the empty string,
  run the following sub-steps:

  1. Let |t| be the {{BlobPropertyBag/type}} dictionary member.
    If |t| contains any characters outside the range U+0020 to U+007E,
    then set |t| to the empty string and return from these substeps.
  1. Convert every character in |t| to [=ASCII lowercase=].

1. Return a {{Blob}} object referring to |bytes| as its associated <a>byte</a> sequence,
  with its {{Blob/size}} set to the length of |bytes|,
  and its {{Blob/type}} set to the value of |t| from the substeps above.

<h4 id="constructorParams">
Constructor Parameters</h4>

The {{Blob()}} constructor can be invoked with the parameters below:

<dl>
  <dt>A <dfn id="dfn-blobParts" argument for="Blob/Blob(blobParts, options)"><code>blobParts</code></dfn> <code>sequence</code>
  <dd>which takes any number of the following types of elements, and in any order:
    * {{BufferSource}} elements.
    * {{Blob}} elements.
    * {{USVString}} elements.

  <dt id="dfn-BlobPropertyBagMembers">An *optional* {{BlobPropertyBag}}
  <dd>which takes these optional members:
    * <dfn id="dfn-BPtype" dict-member for="BlobPropertyBag">type</dfn>,
      the ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the {{Blob}}.
      Normative conditions for this member are provided in the [[#constructorBlob]].
    * <dfn dict-member for="BlobPropertyBag">endings</dfn>,
      an enum which can take the values {{"transparent"}} or {{"native"}}.
      By default this is set to {{"transparent"}}. If set to {{"native"}},
      [=convert line endings to native|line endings will be converted to native=]
      in any {{USVString}} elements in {{blobParts}}.

1. For each |element| in |parts|:

  1. If |element| is a {{USVString}}, run the following substeps:

    1. Let |s| be |element|.

    1. If the {{BlobPropertyBag/endings}} member of |options| is {{"native"}},
      set |s| to the result of [=converting line endings to native=] of |element|.

    1. Append the result of [=UTF-8 encoding=] |s| to |bytes|.

      Note: The algorithm from WebIDL [[WebIDL]] replaces unmatched surrogates in an invalid utf-16 string
      with U+FFFD replacement characters.
      Scenarios exist when the {{Blob}} constructor may result in some data loss
      due to lost or scrambled character sequences.

  1. If |element| is a {{BufferSource}}, <a lt="get a copy of the buffer source">get
    a copy of the bytes held by the buffer source</a>, and append those bytes to |bytes|.

  1. If |element| is a {{Blob}},

1. Append |token| to |result|.

1. While |position| is not past the end of |s|:

  1. If the [=code point=] at |position| within |s| equals U+000D CR:

    1. Append |native line ending| to |result|.

    1. Advance |position| by 1.

    1. If |position| is not past the end of |s|
      and the [=code point=] at |position| within |s| equals U+000A LF
      advance |position| by 1.

  1. Otherwise if the [=code point=] at |position| within |s| equals U+000A LF,

Attributes</h3>

<dl dfn-type="attribute" dfn-for="Blob">
  <dt><dfn id="dfn-size">size</dfn>
  <dd>Returns the size of the <a>byte</a> sequence in number of bytes.
    On getting, conforming user agents must return the total number of bytes that can be read by a {{FileReader}} or {{FileReaderSync}} object,
    or 0 if the {{Blob}} has no bytes to be read.

  <dt><dfn id="dfn-type">type</dfn>
  <dd>The ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the {{Blob}}.
    On getting, user agents must return the type of a {{Blob}}

    such that when it is converted to a <a>byte</a> sequence,
    it is a <a>parsable MIME type</a>,
    or the empty string &ndash; 0 bytes &ndash; if the type cannot be determined.

    The {{Blob/type}} attribute can be set by the web application itself through constructor invocation
    and through the {{Blob/slice()}} call;
    in these cases, further normative conditions for this attribute are in [[#constructorBlob]],
    [[#file-constructor]],
    and [[#slice-method-algo]] respectively.
    User agents can also determine the {{Blob/type}} of a {{Blob}},
    especially if the <a>byte</a> sequence is from an on-disk file;
    in this case, further normative conditions are in the <a>file type guidelines</a>.

    Note: The type <var ignore>t</var> of a {{Blob}} is considered a <a>parsable MIME type</a>,
    if performing the <a>parse a MIME type</a> algorithm to a byte sequence converted from
    the ASCII-encoded string representing the Blob object's type does not return undefined.

    Note: Use of the {{Blob/type}} attribute informs the <a>encoding determination</a>
    and determines the `Content-Type` header when [=/fetching=] [=blob URLs=].

Methods and Parameters</h3>

<h4 id="slice-method-algo">
The slice method</h4>

The <dfn id="dfn-slice" method for=Blob lt="slice(start, end, contentType), slice(start, end), slice(start), slice()">slice()</dfn> method
returns a new {{Blob}} object with bytes ranging from
the optional {{start}} parameter
up to but not including the optional {{end}} parameter,
and with a {{Blob/type}} attribute that is the value of the optional {{contentType!!argument}} parameter.
It must act as follows:

1. Let |O| be the {{Blob}} <a>context object</a> on which the {{slice()}} method is being called.
2. The optional <dfn argument for="Blob/slice(start, end, contentType)" id="dfn-start">start</dfn> parameter
  is a value for the start point of a {{slice()}} call,
  and must be treated as a byte-order position,
  with the zeroth position representing the first byte.
  User agents must process {{Blob/slice()}} with {{start}} normalized according to the following:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>If the optional {{start}} parameter is not used as a parameter when making this call, let |relativeStart| be 0.
    <li>If {{start}} is negative, let |relativeStart| be <code>max(({{Blob/size}} + {{start}}), 0)</code>.
    <li>Else, let |relativeStart| be <code>min(start, size)</code>.
    </ol>

3. The optional <dfn argument for="Blob/slice(start, end, contentType)" id="dfn-end">end</dfn> parameter
  is a value for the end point of a {{slice()}} call.
  User agents must process {{Blob/slice()}} with {{end}} normalized according to the following:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>If the optional {{end}} parameter is not used as a parameter when making this call, let |relativeEnd| be {{Blob/size}}.
    <li>If {{end}} is negative, let |relativeEnd| be <code>max((size + end), 0)</code>.
    <li>Else, let |relativeEnd| be <code>min(end, size)</code>.
  </ol>

4. The optional <dfn argument for="Blob/slice(start, end, contentType)" id="dfn-contentTypeBlob">contentType</dfn> parameter
  is used to set the ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the Blob.
  User agents must process the {{Blob/slice()}} with {{contentType}} normalized according to the following:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>If the {{contentType}} parameter is not provided, let |relativeContentType| be set to the empty string.
    <li>Else let |relativeContentType| be set to {{contentType}} and run the substeps below:
      1. If |relativeContentType| contains any characters outside the range of U+0020 to U+007E,
        then set |relativeContentType| to the empty string and return from these substeps.
      2. Convert every character in |relativeContentType| to [=ASCII lowercase=].
  </ol>

5. Let |span| be <code>max((relativeEnd - relativeStart), 0)</code>.

6. Return a new {{Blob}} object |S| with the following characteristics:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>|S| refers to |span| consecutive <a>byte</a>s from |O|,
      beginning with the <a>byte</a> at byte-order position |relativeStart|.

    <li>|S|.{{Blob/type}} = |relativeContentType|.
  </ol>

<div class="example">
  The examples below illustrate the different types of {{slice()}} calls possible. Since the
  {{File}} interface inherits from the {{Blob}} interface, examples are based on the use of the {{File}} interface.

  <pre class="lang-javascript">

    var file = document.getElementById('file').files[0];

      // Note the use of negative number

      var fileChunkFromEnd = file.slice(-(Math.round(file.size/2)));

      // slice file into 1/2 chunk starting at beginning of file

      var fileChunkFromStart = file.slice(0, Math.round(file.size/2));

<h2 id="file-section">
The File Interface</h2>

A {{File}} object is a {{Blob}} object with a {{File/name}} attribute, which is a string;
it can be created within the web application via a constructor,
or is a reference to a <a>byte</a> sequence from a file from the underlying (OS) file system.

If a {{File}} object is a reference to a <a>byte</a> sequence originating from a file on disk,
then its <a>snapshot state</a> should be set to the state of the file on disk at the time the {{File}} object is created.

Note: This is a non-trivial requirement to implement for user agents,
and is thus not a *must* but a *should* [[RFC2119]].
User agents should endeavor to have a {{File}} object's <a>snapshot state</a>
set to the state of the underlying storage on disk at the time the reference is taken.
If the file is modified on disk following the time a reference has been taken,
the {{File}}'s <a>snapshot state</a> will differ from the state of the underlying storage.
User agents may use modification time stamps and other mechanisms to maintain <a>snapshot state</a>,
but this is left as an implementation detail.

When a {{File}} object refers to a file on disk,
user agents must return the {{Blob/type}} of that file,
and must follow the <dfn export>file type guidelines</dfn> below:

* User agents must return the {{Blob/type}} as an ASCII-encoded string in lower case,
  such that when it is converted to a corresponding byte sequence,
  it is a <a>parsable MIME type</a>,
  or the empty string &ndash; 0 bytes &ndash; if the type cannot be determined.
* When the file is of type <code>text/plain</code>
  user agents must NOT append a charset parameter to the <i>dictionary of parameters</i> portion of the media type [[!MIMESNIFF]].
* User agents must not attempt heuristic determination of encoding,

Constructor</h3>

<div algorithm="file-constructor">
The {{File}} constructor is invoked with two or three parameters,
depending on whether the optional dictionary parameter is used.
When the {{File()}} constructor is invoked,
user agents must run the following steps:

1. Let |bytes| be the result of [=processing blob parts=] given {{fileBits}}
  and {{File/File(fileBits, fileName, options)/options}}.


2. Let |n| be a new string of the same size as the {{fileName}} argument to the constructor.
  Copy every character from {{fileName}} to |n|,
  replacing any "/" character (U+002F SOLIDUS) with a ":" (U+003A COLON).

  Note: Underlying OS filesystems use differing conventions for file name;
  with constructed files, mandating UTF-16 lessens ambiquity when file names are converted to <a>byte</a> sequences.

3. If the optional {{FilePropertyBag}} dictionary argument is used,
  then run the following substeps:

  1. If the {{BlobPropertyBag/type}} member is provided and is not the empty string,
    let |t| be set to the {{BlobPropertyBag/type}} dictionary member.
    If |t| contains any characters outside the range U+0020 to U+007E,
    then set |t| to the empty string and return from these substeps.
  2. Convert every character in |t| to [=ASCII lowercase=].
  3. If the {{FilePropertyBag/lastModified}} member is provided,
    let |d| be set to the  {{FilePropertyBag/lastModified}} dictionary member.
    If it is not provided,
    set |d| to the current date and time
    represented as the number of milliseconds since the <a>Unix Epoch</a>
    (which is the equivalent of <code>Date.now()</code> [[ECMA-262]]).

    Note: Since ECMA-262 {{Date}} objects convert to <code>long long</code> values
    representing the number of milliseconds since the <a>Unix Epoch</a>,
    the {{FilePropertyBag/lastModified}} member could be a {{Date}} object [[ECMA-262]].

4. Return a new {{File}} object |F| such that:
  2. |F| refers to the |bytes| <a>byte</a> sequence.
  3. |F|.{{Blob/size}} is set to the number of total bytes in |bytes|.
  4. |F|.{{File/name}} is set to |n|.
  5. |F|.{{Blob/type}} is set to |t|.
  6. |F|.{{File/lastModified}} is set to |d|.

Attributes</h3>

<dl dfn-type=attribute dfn-for=File>
  <dt><dfn id="dfn-name">name</dfn>
  <dd>The name of the file.
    On getting, this must return the name of the file as a string.
    There are numerous file name variations and conventions used by different underlying OS file systems;
    this is merely the name of the file, without path information.
    On getting, if user agents cannot make this information available,
    they must return the empty string.
    If a {{File}} object is created using a constructor,
    further normative conditions for this attribute are found in [[#file-constructor]].

  <dt><dfn id="dfn-lastModified">lastModified</dfn>
  <dd>The last modified date of the file.
    On getting, if user agents can make this information available,
    this must return a <code>long long</code> set to the time the file was last modified
    as the number of milliseconds since the <a>Unix Epoch</a>.
    If the last modification date and time are not known,
    the attribute must return the current date and time
    as a <code>long long</code> representing the number of milliseconds since the <a>Unix Epoch</a>;
    this is equivalent to <code class="lang-javascript">Date.now()</code> [[ECMA-262]].
    If a {{File}} object is created using a constructor,
    further normative conditions for this attribute are found in [[#file-constructor]].
</dl>

The {{File}} interface is available on objects that expose an attribute of type {{FileList}};
these objects are defined in HTML [[HTML]].
The {{File}} interface, which inherits from {{Blob}}, is immutable,
and thus represents file data that can be read into memory at the time a <a>read operation</a> is initiated.
User agents must process reads on files that no longer exist at the time of read as <a lt="file read error">errors</a>,
throwing a {{NotFoundError}} exception
if using a {{FileReaderSync}} on a Web Worker [[Workers]]
or firing an {{error!!event}} event
with the {{error!!attribute}} attribute returning a {{NotFoundError}}.

<div class="example">
  In the examples below, metadata from a file object is displayed meaningfully, and a file object is created with a name and a last modified date.

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
  var file = document.getElementById("filePicker").files[0];
  var date = new Date(file.lastModified);
  println("You selected the file " + file.name + " which was modified on " + date.toDateString() + ".");

  ...

  // Generate a file with a specific last modified date

  var d = new Date(2013, 12, 5, 16, 23, 45, 600);

<h2 id="filelist-section">
The FileList Interface</h2>

Note: The {{FileList}} interface should be considered "at risk"
since the general trend on the Web Platform is to replace such interfaces
with the {{Array}} platform object in ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]].
In particular, this means syntax of the sort <code class="lang-javascript">filelist.item(0)</code> is at risk;
most other programmatic use of {{FileList}} is unlikely to be affected by the eventual migration to an {{Array}} type.

This interface is a list of {{File}} objects.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker), Serializable]
interface FileList {
  getter File? item(unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
};
</pre>

{{FileList}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=],
given |value| and |serialized|, are:

1. Set |serialized|.\[[Files]] to an empty [=list=].

2. For each |file| in |value|, append the [=sub-serialization=] of |file| to
   |serialized|.\[[Files]].

Their [=deserialization step=], given |serialized| and |value|, are:

1. [=list/For each=] |file| of |serialized|.\[[Files]], add the [=sub-deserialization=] of |file| to |value|.

<div class="example">
  Sample usage typically involves DOM access to the <code>&lt;input type="file"></code> element within a form,
  and then accessing selected files.

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    // uploadData is a form element
    // fileChooser is input element of type 'file'
    var file = document.forms['uploadData']['fileChooser'].files[0];

    // alternative syntax can be
    // var file = document.forms['uploadData']['fileChooser'].files.item(0);

    if(file)
    {

<h2 id="reading-data-section">
Reading Data</h2>

<h3 id="readOperationSection">
The Read Operation</h3>

The algorithm below defines a <a>read operation</a>,
which takes a {{Blob}} and a <a>synchronous flag</a> as input,
and reads <a>byte</a>s into a byte stream
which is returned as the |result| of the <a>read operation</a>,
or else fails along with a <a>failure reason</a>.
Methods in this specification invoke the <a>read operation</a>
with the <a>synchronous flag</a> either set or unset.

The <dfn id="synchronousFlag">synchronous flag</dfn> determines if a read operation is synchronous or asynchronous,
and is *unset* by default.
Methods may set it.
If it is set,
the <a>read operation</a> takes place synchronously.
Otherwise, it takes place asynchronously.

To perform a <dfn id="readOperation">read operation</dfn> on a {{Blob}} and the <a>synchronous flag</a>,
run the following steps:

1. Let |s| be a a new [=/body=],
  |b| be the {{Blob}} to be read from,
  and |bytes| initially set to an empty byte sequence.
  Set the |length| on |s| to the {{Blob/size}} of |b|.
  While there are still bytes to be read in |b|,
  perform the following substeps:

  1. If the <a>synchronous flag</a> is set, follow the steps below:
    1. Let |bytes| be the byte sequence that results from reading a <a>chunk</a> from |b|.
      If a <a>file read error</a> occurs reading a <a>chunk</a> from |b|,
      return |s| with the error flag set,
      along with a <a>failure reason</a>,
      and <a>terminate this algorithm</a>.

      Note: Along with returning failure,
      the synchronous part of this algorithm must return the <a>failure reason</a> that occurred
      for <a lt="throw">throwing an exception</a> by synchronous methods
      that invoke this algorithm with the <a>synchronous flag</a> set.

    2. If there are no errors,
      push |bytes| to |s|,
      and increment |s|'s |transmitted| [[Fetch]]
      by the number of bytes in |bytes|.
      Reset |bytes| to the empty byte sequence
      and continue reading <a>chunk</a>s as above.

    3. When all the bytes of |b| have been read into |s|,
      return |s|
      and <a>terminate this algorithm</a>.

  2. Otherwise, the <a>synchronous flag</a> is unset.
    Return |s| and process the rest of this algorithm asynchronously.

  3. Let |bytes| be the byte sequence that results from reading a <a>chunk</a> from |b|.
    If a <a>file read error</a> occurs reading a <a>chunk</a> from |b|,
    set the error flag on |s|,
    and <a>terminate this algorithm</a> with a <a>failure reason</a>.

    Note: The asynchronous part of this algorithm must signal the <a>failure reason</a> that occurred
    for asynchronous error reporting by methods expecting |s|
    and which invoke this algorithm with the <a>synchronous flag</a> unset.

  4. If no <a>file read error</a> occurs,
    push |bytes| to |s|,
    and increment |s|'s |transmitted| [[Fetch]]
    by the number of bytes in |bytes|.
    Reset |bytes| to the empty byte sequence
    and continue reading <a>chunk</a>s as above.

To perform an <dfn id="task-read-operation">annotated task read operation</dfn>
on a {{Blob}} |b|,
perform the steps below:

1. Perform a <a>read operation</a> on |b| with the <a>synchronous flag</a> unset,
  along with the additional steps below.
2. If the <a>read operation</a> terminates with a <a>failure reason</a>,
  <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn id="process-read-error">process read error</dfn> with the <a>failure reason</a>
  and terminate this algorithm.
3. When the first <a>chunk</a> is being pushed to the [=/body=] |s| during the <a>read operation</a>,
  <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn id="process-read">process read</dfn>.
4. Once the [=/body=] |s| from the <a>read operation</a> has at least one <a>chunk</a> read into it,
  or there are no <a>chunk</a>s left to read from |b|,
  <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn id="process-read-data">process read data</dfn>.
  Keep <a lt="queue a task">queuing tasks</a> to <a>process read data</a>
  for every <a>chunk</a> read or every 50ms,
  whichever is *least frequent*.
5. When all of the <a>chunk</a>s from |b| are read into the [=/body=] |s| from the <a>read operation</a>,
  <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn id="process-read-EOF">process read EOF</dfn>.

Use the <a>file reading task source</a> for all these tasks.


<h3 id="blobreader-task-source">
The File Reading Task Source</h3>

This specification defines a new generic <a>task source</a> called the <dfn id="fileReadingTaskSource">file reading task source</dfn>,
which is used for all <a lt="queue a task">tasks that are queued</a> in this specification

({{FileReaderSync}} makes available several <a>synchronous read methods</a>.
  Collectively, the sync and async read methods of {{FileReader}} and {{FileReaderSync}}
  are referred to as just <dfn lt="read method">read methods</dfn>.)

<h5 id="filedata-attr">
The {{FileReader/result}} attribute</h5>

On getting, the <dfn attribute for=FileReader id="dfn-result">result</dfn> attribute returns a {{Blob}}'s data
as a {{DOMString}}, or as an {{ArrayBuffer}}, or <code>null</code>,
depending on the <a>read method</a> that has been called on the {{FileReader}},
and any errors that may have occurred.

The list below is normative for the {{FileReader/result}} attribute
and is the conformance criteria for this attribute:

* On getting,
  if the {{FileReader/readyState}} is {{FileReader/EMPTY}}
  (no read method has been called)
  then the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return <code>null</code>.
* On getting,
  if an error in reading the {{File}} or {{Blob}} has occurred
  (using *any* <a>read method</a>)
  then the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return <code>null</code>.
* On getting, if the {{FileReader/readAsDataURL()}} <a>read method</a> is used,
  the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return a {{DOMString}}
  that is a Data URL [[!RFC2397]] encoding of the {{File}} or {{Blob}}'s data.
* On getting, if the {{FileReader/readAsBinaryString()}} <a>read method</a> is called
  and no error in reading the {{File}} or {{Blob}} has occurred,
  then the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return a {{DOMString}}
  representing the {{File}} or {{Blob}}'s data as a <dfn>binary string</dfn>,
  in which every byte is represented by a code unit of equal value [0...255].
* On getting, if the {{FileReader/readAsText()}} <a>read method</a> is called
  and no error in reading the {{File}} or {{Blob}} has occurred,
  then the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return a string
  representing the {{File}} or {{Blob}}'s data as a text string,
  and should decode the string into memory in the format specified by the <a>encoding determination</a> as a {{DOMString}}.
* On getting, if the {{FileReader/readAsArrayBuffer()}} <a>read method</a> is called
  and no error in reading the {{File}} or {{Blob}} has occurred,
  then the {{FileReader/result}} attribute must return an {{ArrayBuffer}} object.

<h5 id="readAsDataURL">
The {{FileReader/readAsDataURL()}} method</h5>

When the <dfn method for=FileReader id="dfn-readAsDataURL">readAsDataURL(blob)</dfn> method is called,
the user agent must run the steps below.

1. If {{FileReader/readyState}} = {{FileReader/LOADING}}
  throw an {{InvalidStateError}} exception and <a>terminate this algorithm</a>.
3. Otherwise set {{FileReader/readyState}} to {{FileReader/LOADING}}.
4. Initiate an <a>annotated task read operation</a> using the <code>blob</code> argument as |input|
  and handle <a lt="queue a task">tasks queued</a> on the <a>file reading task source</a> per below.
5. To <a>process read error</a> with a <a>failure reason</a>,
  proceed to [[#dfn-error-steps]].

7. To <a>process read data</a> <a>fire a progress event</a> called {{progress}} at the <a>context object</a>.
8. To <a>process read EOF</a> run these substeps:
  1. Set {{FileReader/readyState}} to {{FileReader/DONE}}.
  2. Set the {{FileReader/result}} attribute to the [=/body=] returned by the <a>read operation</a> as a DataURL [[!RFC2397]];
    on getting, the {{FileReader/result}} attribute returns the <code>blob</code> as a Data URL [[!RFC2397]].

    * Use the <code>blob</code>'s {{Blob/type}} attribute as part of the Data URL if it is available
      in keeping with the Data URL specification [[!RFC2397]].
    * If the {{Blob/type}} attribute is not available on the <code>blob</code> return a Data URL without a media-type. [[!RFC2397]].
      Data URLs that do not have media-types [[RFC2046]] must be treated as plain text by conforming user agents. [[!RFC2397]].
  3. <a>Fire a progress event</a> called {{load}} at the <a>context object</a>.
  4. Unless {{FileReader/readyState}} is {{FileReader/LOADING}}
    <a>fire a progress event</a> called {{loadend}} at the <a>context object</a>.

9. <a>Terminate this algorithm</a>.

<h5 id="readAsDataText">

1. If {{FileReader/readyState}} = {{FileReader/LOADING}} throw an {{InvalidStateError}} and <a>terminate this algorithm</a>.
3. Otherwise set {{FileReader/readyState}} to {{FileReader/LOADING}}.
4. Initiate an <a>annotated task read operation</a> using the <code>blob</code> argument as |input|

5. To <a>process read error</a> with a <a>failure reason</a>,
  proceed to the [[#dfn-error-steps]].
6. To <a>process read</a> <a>fire a progress event</a> called {{loadstart}} at the <a>context object</a>.
7. To <a>process read data</a> <a>fire a progress event</a> called {{progress}} at the <a>context object</a>.
8. To <a>process read EOF</a> run these substeps:

Blob Parameters</h5>

The <a>asynchronous read methods</a>,

<h3 id="enctype">
Determining Encoding</h3>

When reading {{Blob}} objects using the {{FileReader/readAsText()}} <a>read method</a>,
the following <dfn id="encoding-determination">encoding determination</dfn> steps must be followed:

1. Let |encoding| be null.
2. If the {{FileReader/readAsText()/label}} argument is present when calling the method,
  set |encoding| to the result of the <a>getting an encoding</a> from {{FileReader/readAsText()/label}}.
3. If the <a>getting an encoding</a> steps above return failure,
  then set |encoding| to null.
4. If |encoding| is null,
  and the {{FileReader/readAsText()/blob}} argument's {{Blob/type}} attribute is present,
  and it uses a Charset Parameter [[RFC2046]],
  set |encoding| to the result of <a>getting an encoding</a>
  for the portion of the Charset Parameter that is a <i>label</i> of an encoding.

  <div class="example">
    If <code>blob</code> has a {{Blob/type}} attribute of <code>text/plain;charset=utf-8</code>
    then <a>getting an encoding</a> is run using <code>"utf-8"</code> as the label.
    Note that user agents must parse and extract the portion of the Charset Parameter that constitutes a <i>label</i> of an encoding.
  </div>
5. If the <a>getting an encoding</a> steps above return failure,
  then set |encoding| to null.
6. If |encoding| is null,
  then set encoding to utf-8.
7. <a>Decode</a> this <code>blob</code> using fallback encoding |encoding|,
  and return the result.
  On getting, the {{FileReader/result}} attribute of the {{FileReader}} object
  returns a string in |encoding| format.
  The synchronous {{FileReaderSync/readAsText()}} method of the {{FileReaderSync}} object
  returns a string in |encoding| format.

<h3 id="events">
Events</h3>

The {{FileReader}} object must be the event target for all events in this specification.

When this specification says to <dfn>fire a progress event</dfn> <i>called e</i>
(for some {{ProgressEvent}} <code>e</code>
at a given {{FileReader}} <code>reader</code> as the <a>context object</a>),
the following are normative:

* The progress event <code>e</code> does not bubble.  <code>e.bubbles</code> must be false [[DOM]]
* The progress event <code>e</code> is NOT cancelable. <code>e.cancelable</code> must be false [[DOM]]

<h4 id="event-summary">

<h4 id="eventInvariants">
Summary of Event Invariants</h4>

*This section is informative.*

The following are invariants applicable to <a lt="fire an event">event firing</a>
for a given asynchronous <a>read method</a> in this specification:

1. Once a {{loadstart}} has been fired,
  a corresponding {{loadend}} fires at completion of the read,
  UNLESS any of the following are true:

  * the <a>read method</a> has been cancelled using {{FileReader/abort()}}
    and a new <a>read method</a> has been invoked
  * the event handler function for a {{load}} event initiates a new read
  * the event handler function for a {{error!!event}} event initiates a new read.

  Note: The events {{loadstart}} and {{loadend}} are not coupled in a one-to-one manner.

  <div class="example">
    This example showcases "read-chaining":
    initiating another read from within an event handler while the "first" read continues processing.

    <pre class="lang-javascript">
      // In code of the sort...
      reader.readAsText(file);
      reader.onload = function(){reader.readAsText(alternateFile);}

      .....

      //... the loadend event must not fire for the first read

      reader.readAsText(file);
      reader.abort();
      reader.onabort = function(){reader.readAsText(updatedFile);}

      //... the loadend event must not fire for the first read
    </pre>
  </div>
2. One {{progress}} event will fire when <code>blob</code> has been completely read into memory.
3. No {{progress}} event fires before {{loadstart}}.
4. No {{progress}} event fires after any one of {{abort}}, {{load}}, and {{error!!event}} have fired.
  At most one of {{abort}}, {{load}}, and {{error!!event}} fire for a given read.
5. No {{abort}}, {{load}}, or {{error!!event}} event fires after {{loadend}}.

<h3 id="readingOnThreads">
Reading on Threads</h3>

Web Workers allow for the use of synchronous {{File}} or {{Blob}} read APIs,
since such reads on threads do not block the main thread.
This section defines a synchronous API, which can be used within Workers [[Web Workers]].
Workers can avail of both the asynchronous API (the {{FileReader}} object)
*and* the synchronous API (the {{FileReaderSync}} object).

<h4 id="FileReaderSync">
The {{FileReaderSync}} API</h4>

This interface  provides methods to <dfn id="read-method-sync" lt="synchronous read method">synchronously read</dfn>
{{File}} or {{Blob}} objects into memory.

<h5 id="filereadersyncConstrctr">
Constructors</h5>

When the {{FileReaderSync()}} constructor is invoked,
the user agent must return a new {{FileReaderSync}} object.

  * Use the <code>blob</code>'s {{Blob/type}} attribute as part of the Data URL if it is available
    in keeping with the Data URL specification [[!RFC2397]].
  * If the {{Blob/type}} attribute is not available on the <code>blob</code> return a Data URL without a media-type. [[!RFC2397]].
    Data URLs that do not have media-types [[RFC2046]] must be treated as plain text by conforming user agents. [[!RFC2397]].

<h5 id="readAsArrayBufferSyncSection">
The {{FileReaderSync/readAsArrayBuffer()}} method</h5>

When the <dfn method for=FileReaderSync id="dfn-readAsArrayBufferSync">readAsArrayBuffer(blob)</dfn> method is called,

<h2 id=url>
A URL for Blob and File reference</h2>

This section defines a [=url/scheme=] for a [=/URL=] used to refer to {{Blob}} objects (and {{File}} objects).

Note: other specifications, such as [[MEDIA-SOURCE]] extend this scheme to also refer to other types of objects.

<h3 id="url-intro">
Introduction</h3>

*This section is informative.*

[=Blob URL|Blob (or object) URLs=] are URLs like
`blob:http://example.com/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.
This enables integration of {{Blob}}s and {{File}}s with other Web Platform APIs
that are only designed to be used with URLs, such as the <{img}> element.
[=Blob URLs=] can also be used to navigate to as well as to trigger downloads of
locally generated data.

For this purpose two static methods are exposed on the {{URL}} interface,
{{URL/createObjectURL(blob)}} and {{URL/revokeObjectURL(url)}}.
The first method creates a mapping from a [=/URL=] to a {{Blob}},
and the second method revokes said mapping.
As long as the mapping exist the {{Blob}} can't be garbage collected,
so some care must be taken to revoke the URL as soon as the reference is no longer needed.
All URLs are revoked when the global that created the URL itself goes away.

<h3 id="url-model">
Model</h3>

Each user agent must maintain a <dfn id="BlobURLStore" export>blob URL store</dfn>.
A [=blob URL store=] is a [=map=]
where [=map/keys=] are [=valid URL strings=]
and [=map/values=] are [=blob URL Entries=].

A <dfn>blob URL entry</dfn> consists of
an <dfn for="blob URL entry">object</dfn> (typically a {{Blob}},
but other specs can extend this to refer to other types of objects),
and an <dfn for="blob URL entry">environment</dfn> (an [=environment settings object=]).

[=map/Keys=] in the [=blob URL store=] (also known as <dfn lt="blob URL|object URL" export>blob URLs</dfn>)
are [=valid URL strings=] that when [=URL parser|parsed=]
result in a [=/URL=] with a [=url/scheme=] equal to "`blob`",
an [=empty host=], and a [=url/path=] consisting of one element itself also a [=valid URL string=].

<div algorithm="createBlobURL">

1. Let |serialized| be the <a lt="ASCII serialization of an origin">ASCII serialization</a> of |origin|.
1. If |serialized| is "`null`", set it to an implementation-defined value.

1. Generate a UUID [[!RFC4122]] as a string and append it to |result|.

<div algorithm="resolveURLOrigin">

1. Return a new [=opaque origin=], if |nested url| is failure, and |nested url|'s [=url/origin=] otherwise.

</div>

Note: The effect of this algorithm is that the origin of a blob URL is always
the same as that of the environment that created the URL,
as long as the URL hasn't been revoked yet.
If the URL was revoked the serialization of the origin will still remain the same
as the serialization of the origin of the environment that created the blob URL,
but for opaque origins the origin itself might be distinct.
This difference isn't observable though, since a revoked blob URL can't be resolved/fetched anymore anyway.

Issue: The [[URL]] spec should be updated to refer to this algorithm to resolve the origin of a blob URL when the URL is first parsed.
This is tracked in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/FileAPI/issues/63">issue #63</a> and in

1. Remove from |store| any entries for which the [=map/value=]'s [=blob URL entry/environment=] is equal to |environment|.

Issue: This needs a similar hook when a worker is unloaded.

Creating and Revoking a blob URL</h3>

<a>Blob URLs</a> are created and revoked using static methods exposed on the {{URL}} object.
Revocation of a <a>blob URL</a> decouples the <a>blob URL</a> from the resource it refers to,
and if it is dereferenced after it is revoked,
user agents must act as if a <a>network error</a> has occurred.
This section describes a supplemental interface to the URL specification [[URL]]
and presents methods for <a>blob URL</a> creation and revocation.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,DedicatedWorker,SharedWorker)]
partial interface URL {
  static DOMString createObjectURL(Blob blob);
  static void revokeObjectURL(DOMString url);
};
</pre>

<div algorithm="createObjectURL">
The <dfn method for=URL id="dfn-createObjectURL">createObjectURL(|blob|)</dfn> static method must
return the result of [=adding an entry to the blob URL store=] for |blob|.
</div>

<div algorithm="revokeObjectURL">
The <dfn method for=URL id="dfn-revokeObjectURL">revokeObjectURL(|url|)</dfn> static method must run these steps:

1. Let |url record| be the result of [=URL parser|parsing=] |url|.
1. If |url record|'s [=url/scheme=] is not "`blob`", return.
1. Let |origin| be the result of [=resolving the origin=] of |url record|.
1. Let |settings| be the [=current settings object=].
1. If |origin| is not [=same origin=] with |settings|'s [=environment settings object/origin=], return.
1. [=Remove an entry from the Blob URL Store=] for |url|.

Note: This means that rather than throwing some kind of error, attempting to revoke a URL that isn't registered will silently fail.
User agents might display a message on the error console is this happens.

Note: Attempts to dereference |url| after it has been revoked will result in a [=network error=].
Requests that were started before the |url| was revoked should still succeed.
</div>

<div class="example">
  In the example below,
  <code>window1</code> and <code>window2</code> are separate,
  but in the <a>same origin</a>;
  <code>window2</code> could be an <{iframe}> inside <code>window1</code>.

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    myurl = window1.URL.createObjectURL(myblob);
    window2.URL.revokeObjectURL(myurl);
  </pre>

  Since a user agent has one global [=blob URL store=],
  it is possible to revoke an object URL from a different window than from which it was created.
  The <code>URL.{{revokeObjectURL()}}</code> call
  ensures that subsequent dereferencing of <code>myurl</code>
  results in a the user agent acting as if a <a>network error</a> has occurred.
</div>

<h4 id="examplesOfCreationRevocation">
Examples of blob URL Creation and Revocation</h4>

<a>Blob URL</a>s are strings that are used to [=/fetch=] {{Blob}} objects,
and can persist for as long as the <code>document</code> from which they were minted
using <code>URL.{{createObjectURL()}}</code>--
see [[#lifeTime]].

This section gives sample usage of creation and revocation of <a>blob URL</a>s with explanations.

<div class="example">
  In the example below, two <{img}> elements [[HTML]] refer to the same <a>blob URL</a>:

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    img1.src = url;
    img2.src = url;
  </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
  In the example below,  <code>URL.{{revokeObjectURL()}}</code> is explicitly called.

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    var blobURLref = URL.createObjectURL(file);
    img1 = new Image();
    img2 = new Image();

    // Both assignments below work as expected
    img1.src = blobURLref;
    img2.src = blobURLref;

    // ... Following body load
    // Check if both images have loaded
    if(img1.complete && img2.complete) {
      // Ensure that subsequent refs throw an exception
      URL.revokeObjectURL(blobURLref);
    } else {
      msg("Images cannot be previewed!");
      // revoke the string-based reference
      URL.revokeObjectURL(blobURLref);
    }
  </pre>
</div>

The example above allows multiple references to a single <a>blob URL</a>,
and the web developer then revokes the <a>blob URL</a> string after both image objects have been loaded.
While not restricting number of uses of the <a>blob URL</a> offers more flexibility,
it increases the likelihood of leaks;
developers should pair it with a corresponding call to <code>URL.{{revokeObjectURL()}}</code>.

<h2 id="security-discussion">
Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

*This section is informative.*

This specification allows web content to read files from the underlying file system,
as well as provides a means for files to be accessed by unique identifiers,
and as such is subject to some security considerations.
This specification also assumes that the primary user interaction is with the <code>&lt;input type="file"/></code> element of HTML forms [[HTML]],
and that all files that are being read by {{FileReader}} objects have first been selected by the user.
Important security considerations include preventing malicious file selection attacks (selection looping),
preventing access to system-sensitive files,
and guarding against modifications of files on disk after a selection has taken place.

* <dfn id="selection-looping">Preventing selection looping</dfn>.
  During file selection, a user may be bombarded with the file picker associated with <code>&lt;input type="file"/></code>
  (in a "must choose" loop that forces selection before the file picker is dismissed)
  and a user agent may prevent file access to any selections by making the  {{FileList}} object returned be of size 0.
* <dfn id="sensitive-files">System-sensitive files</dfn>
  (e.g. files in /usr/bin, password files, and other native operating system executables)
  typically should not be exposed to web content,
  and should not be accessed via <a>blob URLs</a>.
  User agents may <a>throw</a> a {{SecurityError}} exception for synchronous read methods,
  or return a {{SecurityError}} exception for asynchronous reads.

Issue: This section is provisional; more security data may supplement this in subsequent drafts.

<h2 id="requirements">
Requirements and Use Cases</h2>

This section covers what the requirements are for this API,
as well as illustrates some use cases.
This version of the API does not satisfy all use cases;
subsequent versions may elect to address these.

* Once a user has given permission,
  user agents should provide the ability to read and parse data directly from a local file programmatically.

  <div class="example">
    A lyrics viewer.
    User wants to read song lyrics from songs in his plist file.
    User browses for plist file.
    File is opened, read, parsed, and presented to the user as a sortable, actionable list within a web application.
    User can select songs to fetch lyrics.
    User uses the "browse for file" dialog.
  </div>
* Data should be able to be stored locally so that it is available for later use,
  which is useful for offline data access for web applications.

  <div class="example">
    A Calendar App.
    User's company has a calendar.
    User wants to sync local events to company calendar,
    marked as "busy" slots (without leaking personal info).
    User browses for file and selects it.
    The <code>text/calendar</code> file is parsed in the browser,
    allowing the user to merge the files to one calendar view.
    The user wants to then save the file back to his local calendar file (using "Save As"?).
    The user can also send the integrated calendar file back to the server calendar store asynchronously.
  </div>
* User agents should provide the ability to save a local file programmatically given an amount of data and a file name.

  Note: While this specification doesn't provide an explicit API call to trigger downloads,
  the HTML5 specification has addressed this.
  The <{a/download}> attribute of the <{a}> element initiates a download,
  saving a {{File}} with the name specified.
  The combination of this API and the <{a/download}> attribute on <{a}> elements
  allows for the creation of files within web applications,
  and the ability to save them locally.

  <div class="example">
    A Spreadsheet App.
    User interacts with a form, and generates some input.
    The form then generates a CSV (Comma Separated Variables) output for the user to import into a spreadsheet,
    and uses "Save...".
    The generated output can also be directly integrated into a web-based spreadsheet,
    and uploaded asynchronously.
  </div>
* User agents should provide a streamlined programmatic ability to send data from a file to a remote server
  that works more efficiently than form-based uploads today.

  <div class="example">
    A Video/Photo Upload App.
    User is able to select large files for upload,
    which can then be "chunk-transfered" to the server.
  </div>
* User agents should provide an API exposed to script that exposes the features above.
  The user is notified by UI anytime interaction with the file system takes place,
  giving the user full ability to cancel or abort the transaction.
  The user is notified of any file selections,
  and can cancel these.
  No invocations to these APIs occur silently without user intervention.
