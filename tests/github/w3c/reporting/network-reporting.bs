Abstract:
  This document extends the generic reporting framework from the Reporting API
  with a mechanisms for web developers to associate groups of reporting
  endpoints with origins they control, and defines how reports can reliably be
  sent to those endpoints, in order to be able to report on network conditions,
  or other concerns which exceed the scope of a single document, in a consistent
  manner.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  This document extends the concepts defined in [[REPORTING]] to enable a class
  of reports which are not tied to the lifetime of any particular document. This
  enables network errors to be reported on, even (or especially) in cases where
  a document could not be loaded.

  Decoupling reports from documents implies two major differences from the
  document-centred reporting defined in [[REPORTING]]: First, configuration of
  reporting must be done at the origin level, rather than through document
  response headers. Second, the reports are queued and delivered by the user
  agent separately from document reports.

  <h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>

  This specification aims to provide a best-effort report delivery system that
  executes out-of-band with website activity. The user agent will be able to do
  a better job prioritizing and scheduling delivery of reports, as it has an
  overview of cross-origin activity that individual websites do not, and can
  deliver reports based on error conditions that would prevent a website from
  loading in the first place.

  The delivery is not, however, guaranteed in a strict sense. We spell out a
  reasonable set of retry rules in the algorithms below, but it's quite possible
  for a report to be dropped on the floor if things go badly.

  Reporting can generate a good deal of traffic, so we allow developers to set
  up groups of <a for="/" data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a>, using a failover and
  load-balancing mechanism inspired by the DNS <a>SRV record</a>.  The user
  agent will do its best to deliver a particular report to <strong>at most
  one</strong> endpoint in a group.  Endpoints can be assigned weights to
  distribute load, with each endpoint receiving a specified fraction of
  reporting traffic.  Endpoints can be assigned priorities, allowing developers
  to set up fallback collectors that are only tried when uploads to primary
  collectors fail.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. wants to collect Network Error Log reports for its site.
    It can do so by serving an origin policy manifest with the following key,
    to define a set of reporting endpoints named "`endpoint-1`":

    <pre>
      {
      "<a>network_reporting_endpoints</a>": {
        "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">group</a>": "endpoint-1",
        "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">max_age</a>": 10886400,
        "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">endpoints</a>": [
          { "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">url</a>": "https://example.com/reports", "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">priority</a>": 1 },
          { "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">url</a>": "https://backup.com/reports", "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">priority</a>": 2 }
        ] }
      }
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct NEL reports to that group:

    <pre>
      NEL: { ..., "<a lt="reports directive">report-to</a>": "endpoint-1" }
    </pre>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2 id="concept">Concepts</h2>

  <h3 id="concept-endpoint-groups">Endpoint groups</h3>

  An <dfn export>endpoint group</dfn> is a set of <a
  data-lt="network reporting endpoint">network reporting endpoints</a> that will
  be used together for backup and failover purposes.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>name</dfn>, which is an ASCII
  string.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has an <dfn
  for="endpoint group" export attribute>endpoints</dfn> list, which is a list of
  <a data-lt="network reporting endpoint">network reporting endpoints</a>.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint group"
  export attribute>subdomains</dfn> flag, which is either "`include`" or
  "`exclude`".

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint group"
  export attribute>ttl</dfn> representing the number of seconds the group
  remains valid for an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint group"
  export attribute>creation</dfn> which is the timestamp at which the group was
  added to an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  A <a>endpoint group</a> is <dfn for="endpoint group"
  id="endpoint-group-expired">expired</dfn> if its {{endpoint group/creation}}
  plus its {{endpoint group/ttl}} represents a time in the past.

  <h3 id="concept-network-endpoint">Network reporting endpoints</h3>

  A <dfn>network reporting endpoint</dfn> is an <a for="/">endpoint</a>, which
  is extended with these additional attributes:

  Each <a>network reporting endpoint</a> has a <dfn
  for="network reporting endpoint" export attribute>priority</dfn>, which is a
  non-negative integer.

  Each <a>network reporting endpoint</a> has a <dfn
  for="network reporting endpoint" export attribute>weight</dfn>, which is a
  non-negative integer.

  Each <a>network reporting endpoint</a> has a <dfn
  for="network reporting endpoint" export attribute>retry_after</dfn>, which is
  either `null`, or a timestamp after which delivery should be retried.

  An <a>network reporting endpoint</a> is <dfn
  for="network reporting endpoint">pending</dfn> if its
  {{network reporting endpoint/retry_after}} is not `null`, and represents a
  time in the future.

  <h3 id="concept-client">Clients</h3>

  A <dfn export>client</dfn> represents a particular origin's relationship to
  a set of <a for="/" data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has an <dfn for="client" export attribute>origin</dfn>,
  which is an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has an <dfn for="client" export
  attribute>endpoint-groups</dfn> list, which is a list of <a>endpoint
  groups</a>, each of which MUST have a distinct {{endpoint group/name}}.
  (The algorithm in [[#process-configuration]] guarantees this by keeping only
  the first entry in the configuration member with a particular name.)

  <h3 id="concept-failover-load-balancing">Failover and load balancing</h3>

  The <a>network reporting endpoints</a> in an <a>endpoint group</a> that all
  have the same {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} form a <dfn
  export>failover class</dfn>. <a>Failover classes</a> allow the developer to
  provide backup collectors (those with higher
  {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} values) that will only receive reports
  if **all** of the primary collectors (those with lower
  {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} values) fail.

  Developers can assign each <a>network reporting endpoint</a> in a <a>failover
  class</a> a {{network reporting endpoint/weight}}, which determines how report
  traffic is balanced across the <a>failover class</a>.

  The algorithm that implements these rules is described in
  [[#choose-endpoint]].

  Note: The {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} and
  {{network reporting endpoint/weight}} fields have the same semantics as the
  corresponding fields in a DNS <a>SRV record</a>.

  Note: Failover and load balancing is a feature that would be generally useful
  outside of Reporting.  Reporting delegates to the [[FETCH]] API to actually
  upload reports once an endpoint has been selected.  If, in the future, the
  Fetch API adds native support for failover and load balancing of requests, a
  future version of this specification will be updated to use it instead of this
  bespoke mechanism.

  <h3 id="concept-storage">Storage</h3>

  A conformant user agent MUST provide a <dfn>reporting cache</dfn>, which
  is a storage mechanism that maintains a set of <a>endpoint groups</a>
  that websites have instructed the user agent to associate with their
  <a spec="html">origins</a>, and a set of <a>reports</a> which are queued for
  delivery.

  This storage mechanism is opaque, vendor-specific, and not exposed to the
  web, but it MUST provide the following methods which will be used in the
  algorithms this document defines:

  1.  Insert, update, and remove <a>clients</a>.
  2.  Enqueue and dequeue <a>reports</a> for delivery.
  3.  Retrieve a list of <a>client</a> objects for an <a spec="html">origin</a>.
  4.  Retrieve a list of queued <a>report</a> objects.
  5.  Clear the cache.

<section>
  <h2 id="endpoint-delivery">Endpoint Delivery</h2>

  A server MAY define a set of <a>endpoint groups</a> for an origin it controls
  through an <a>origin policy manifest</a> [[!ORIGIN-POLICY]].

  <a>Endpoint groups</a> are specified with the `"network_reporting_endpoints"`
  member, which defines the <a>endpoint groups</a> to be associated with that
  origin.

  This member is defined in [[#network_reporting_endpoints-policy-item]], and
  its processing in [[#process-configuration]].

  <h3 id="network_reporting_endpoints-policy-item">The
  "network_reporting_endpoints" policy item</h3>

  The <dfn>`network_reporting_endpoints`</dfn> member defines the <a>endpoint
  groups</a> to be associated with the origin.

  If present, the member must be an array of objects.

  Each object in the array defines a <a>endpoint group</a> to which
  reports may be delivered, and will be parsed as defined in
  [[#process-configuration]].

  The following subsections define the set of known members which may be
  specified for each object in the array.  Future versions of this document may
  define additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members
  when parsing the configuration.

  <h4 id="id-member">The `group` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints">`group`</dfn> member is a
  string that associates a {{endpoint group/name}} with the <a>endpoint
  group</a>.

  If present, the member's value MUST be a string. If not present, the
  <a>endpoint group</a> will be given the {{endpoint group/name}}
  "`default`".

  <h4 id="include-subdomains-member">The `include_subdomains` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints">`include_subdomains`</dfn>
  member is a boolean that enables this <a>endpoint group</a> for all
  subdomains of the current <a spec="html">origin</a>'s [=origin/host=].

  <h4 id="max-age-member">The `max_age` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints" export>`max_age`</dfn>
  member defines the <a>endpoint group</a>'s lifetime, as a non-negative
  integer number of seconds.

  The member's value MUST be a non-negative number.

  A value of "`0`" will cause the <a>endpoint group</a> to be removed
  from the user agent's <a>reporting cache</a>.

  <h4 id="endpoints-member">The `endpoints` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints" export>`endpoints`</dfn>
  member defines the list of <a for="/" data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a> that
  belong to this <a>endpoint group</a>.

  The member's value MUST be an array of JSON objects.

  The following subsections define the initial set of known members in each
  JSON object in the array. Future versions of this document may define
  additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members when
  parsing the elements of the array.

  <!--
  Note: If a group resolves to multiple <a>endpoints</a>, the user agent will
  deliver a particular <a>report</a> to <strong>at most one</strong>
  <a>endpoint</a> in that group on a best-effort basis.
  -->

  <h4 id="endpoints-url-member">The `endpoints.url` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints">`url`</dfn> member is a
  string that defines the location of the <a for="/">endpoint</a>.

  The member's value MUST be a string. Moreover, the URL that the member's value
  represents MUST be <a>potentially trustworthy</a> [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]].
  Non-secure endpoints will be ignored.

  <h4 id="endpoints-priority-member">The `endpoints.priority` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints">`priority`</dfn> member is
  a number that defines which failover class the <a for="/">endpoint</a> belongs
  to.

  The member's value, if present, MUST be a non-negative integer.

  <h4 id="endpoints-weight-member">The `endpoints.weight` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="network_reporting_endpoints">`weight`</dfn> member is a
  number that defines load balancing for the failover class that the <a
  for="/">endpoint</a> belongs to.

  The member's value, if present, MUST be a non-negative integer.

  <h3 id="process-configuration" algorithm>
    Process origin policy configuration
  </h3>

  Given a <a>map</a> (|parsed|), and an <a spec="html">origin</a> (|origin|),
  this algorithm extracts a list of <a>network reporting endpoints</a>
  and <a>endpoint groups</a> for |origin|, and updates the <a>reporting
  cache</a> accordingly.

  Note: This algorithm is called from around step 9 of
  [[ORIGIN-POLICY#parse-a-string-into-an-origin-policy]], and only updates the
  <a>reporting cache</a> if the |response| has been delivered securely.

  ISSUE: Origin Policy monkey patching. Talk to Domenic.

  1.  Let |groups| be an empty list.

  2.  If |parsed|["network_reporting_endpoints"] exists and is a list, then for
      each |item| in |parsed|["network_reporting_endpoints"]:

      1.  If |item| has no member named "<a
          for="network_reporting_endpoints">`max_age`</a>", or that member's
          value is not a number, skip to the next |item|.

      2.  If |item| has no member named "<a
          for="network_reporting_endpoints">`endpoints`</a>", or that member's
          value is not an array, skip to the next |item|.

      3.  Let |name| be |item|'s "<a
          for="network_reporting_endpoints">`group`</a>" member's value if
          present, and "`default`" otherwise.

      4.  If there is already a <a>endpoint group</a> in |groups| whose
          {{endpoint group/name}} is |name|, skip to the next |item|.

      5.  Let |endpoints| be an empty list.

      6.  For each |endpoint item| in the value of |item|'s "<a
          for="network_reporting_endpoints">`endpoints`</a>" member:

          1.  If |endpoint item| has no member named "<a
              for="network_reporting_endpoints">`url`</a>", or that member's
              value is not a string, or if that value is not an
              <a>absolute-URL string</a> or a <a>path-absolute-URL string</a>,
              skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          2.  Let |endpoint url| be the result of executing the <a>URL
              parser</a> on |endpoint item|'s "<a
              for="network_reporting_endpoints">`url`</a>" member's value, with
              <a spec="url">base URL</a> set to |response|'s <a for="response"
              attribute>url</a>. If |endpoint url| is failure, skip to the next
              |endpoint item|.

          3.  If |endpoint item| has a member named "<a
              for="network_reporting_endpoints">`priority`</a>", whose value is
              not a non-negative integer, skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          4.  If |endpoint item| has a member named "<a
              for="network_reporting_endpoints">`weight`</a>", whose value is
              not a non-negative integer, skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          5.  Let |endpoint| be a new <a>network reporting endpoint</a> whose
              properties are set as follows:

              :   {{endpoint/name}}
              ::  `null`
              :   {{endpoint/url}}
              ::  |endpoint url|
              :   {{network reporting endpoint/priority}}
              ::  The value of the |endpoint item|'s "<a
                  for="network_reporting_endpoints">`priority`</a>" member, if
                  present; `1` otherwise.
              :   {{network reporting endpoint/weight}}
              ::  The value of the |endpoint item|'s "<a
                  for="network_reporting_endpoints">`weight`</a>" member, if
                  present; `1` otherwise.
              :   {{endpoint/failures}}
              ::  0
              :   {{network reporting endpoint/retry_after}}
              ::  `null`

          5.  Add |endpoint| to |endpoints|.

      7.  Let |group| be a new <a>endpoint group</a> whose properties
          are set as follows:

          :   {{endpoint group/name}}
          ::  |name|
          :   {{endpoint group/subdomains}}
          ::  "`include`" if |item| has a member named "<a
              for="network_reporting_endpoints">`include_subdomains`</a>" whose
              value is `true`, "`exclude`" otherwise.
          :   {{endpoint group/ttl}}
          ::  |item|'s "<a for="network_reporting_endpoints">`max_age`</a>"
              member's value.
          :   {{endpoint group/creation}}
          ::  The current timestamp
          :   {{endpoint group/endpoints}}
          ::  |endpoints|

      8.  Add |group| to |groups|.

  3.  Let |client| be a new <a>client</a> whose properties are set as follows:

      :   {{client/origin}}
      ::  |origin|
      :   {{client/endpoint-groups}}
      ::  |groups|

  4.  If there is already an entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for |origin|,
      remove it.

  5. Insert |client| into the <a>reporting cache</a> for |origin|.

  <h2 id="report-generation">Report Generation</h2>

  Network reports can be generated with or without an active document. If a
  document is present, and can be considered the source of the report, then the
  report generated may be visible to reporting observers in that document.

  When a user agent is to <dfn export>generate a network report</dfn>, given a
  string (|type|), another string (|endpoint group|), a serializable object
  (|data|), and an optional <a>Document</a> (|document|), it must run the
  following steps:

  1.  If |document| is given, then

      1.  Let |settings| be |document|'s [=environment settings object=].

      2.  Let |report| be the result of running [[REPORTING#queue-report]] with
          |data|, |type|, |endpoint group| and |settings|.

  2.  Otherwise, let |report| be the result of running
      [[REPORTING#queue-report]] with |data|, |type|, and |endpoint group|.

  3. Append |report| to the <a>reporting cache</a>.

  <h2 id="report-delivery">Report Delivery</h2>

  Over time, various features will queue up a list of <a>reports</a> in the
  user agent's <a>reporting cache</a>. The user agent will periodically grab
  the list of currently pending reports, and deliver them to the associated
  endpoints. This document does not define a schedule for the user agent to
  follow, and assumes that the user agent will have enough contextual
  information to deliver reports in a timely manner, balanced against impacting
  a user's experience.

  That said, a user agent SHOULD make an effort to deliver reports as soon as
  possible after queuing, as a report's data might be significantly more useful
  in the period directly after its generation than it would be a day or a week
  later.

  <h3 id="choose-endpoint">
    Choose an |endpoint| from a |group|
  </h3>

  Note: This algorithm is the same as the <a for="SRV">target selection
    algorithm</a> used for DNS <a>SRV records</a>.

  Given an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|), this algorithm chooses an arbitrary
  eligible <a for="/">endpoint</a> from the group, if there is one, taking into
  account the {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} and
  {{network reporting endpoint/weight}} of the <a for="/"
  data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a>.

  1.  Let |endpoints| be a copy of |group|'s {{endpoint group/endpoints}} list.

  2.  Remove every |endpoint| from |endpoints| that is
      <a for="network reporting endpoint">pending</a>.

  3.  If |endpoints| is empty, return `null`.

  4.  Let |priority| be the minimum {{network reporting endpoint/priority}}
      value of each |endpoint| in |endpoints|.

  5.  Remove every |endpoint| from |endpoints| whose
      {{network reporting endpoint/priority}} value is not equal to |priority|.

  6.  If |endpoints| is empty, return `null`.

  7.  Let |total weight| be the sum of the {{network reporting endpoint/weight}}
      value of each |endpoint| in |endpoints|.

  8.  Let |weight| be a random number &ge; 0 and &le; |total weight|.

  9.  For each |endpoint| in |endpoints|:

      1.  If |weight| is less than or equal to |endpoint|'s
          {{network reporting endpoint/weight}}, return |endpoint|.

      2.  Subtract |endpoint|'s {{network reporting endpoint/weight}} from
          |weight|.

  10. It should not be possible to fall through to here, since the random number
      chosen earlier will be less than or equal to |total weight|.

  <h3 id="send-reports" algorithm>
    Send reports
  </h3>

  A user agent sends reports by executing the following steps:

  1.  Let |reports| be a copy of the list of queued <a>report</a> objects in
      <a>reporting cache</a>.

  2.  Let |endpoint map| be an empty map of <a>network reporting endpoint</a>
      objects to lists of <a>report</a> objects.

  3.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  Let |origin| be the <a>origin</a> of |report|'s [=report/url=].

      2.  Let |client| be the entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for
          |origin|.

      3.  If there exists an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|) in
          |client|'s {{client/endpoint-groups}} list whose
          {{endpoint group/name}} is |report|'s [=report/destination=]:

          1.  Let |endpoint| be the result of executing [[#choose-endpoint]] on
              |group|.

          2.  If |endpoint| is not `null`:

              1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports for
                  |endpoint|.

              2.  Skip to the next |report|.

      4.  If |origin| is a [=tuple origin=] whose [=origin/host=] is a
          [=domain=]:

          1.  For each |parent domain| that is a <a>superdomain match</a>
              for |origin|'s [=origin/host=] [[!RFC6797]], considering longer
              domains first:

              1.  Let |parent origin| be a copy of |origin|, with its
                  [=origin/host=] replaced with |parent domain|.

              2.  Let |client| be the entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for
                  |parent origin|.

              3.  If there exists an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|) in
                  |client|'s {{client/endpoint-groups}} list whose {{endpoint
                  group/name}} is |report|'s [=report/destination=] <b>and</b>
                  whose {{endpoint group/subdomains}} flag is "`include`":

                  1.  Let |endpoint| be the result of executing
                      [[#choose-endpoint]] on |group|.

                  2.  If |endpoint| is not `null`:

                      1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports
                          for |endpoint|.

                      2.  Skip to the next |report|.

          Note: This algorithm ensures that more specific {{endpoint
          group/subdomains}} policies take precendence over less specific ones,
          and that {{endpoint group/subdomains}} policies are ignored for any
          non-[=domain=] origins (e.g., for a request to a raw IP address).

      5.  If we reach this step, the |report| did not match any <a>network
          reporting endpoint</a> and the user agent MAY remove |report| from the
          <a>reporting cache</a> directly. Depending on load, the user agent MAY
          instead wait for [[#gc]] at some point in the future.

  4.  For each (|endpoint|, |reports|) pair in |endpoint map|:

      1.  Let |origin map| be an empty map of <a spec="html">origins</a> to
          lists of <a>report</a> objects.

      2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

          1.  Let |origin| be the <a>origin</a> of |report|'s [=report/url=].

          2.  Append |report| to |origin map|'s list of reports for |origin|.

      3.  For each (|origin|, |per-origin reports|) pair in |origin map|,
          execute the following steps asynchronously:

          1.  Let |result| be the result of executing [[REPORTING#try-delivery]]
              on |endpoint|, |origin|, and |per-origin reports|.

          2.  If |result| is "`Success`":

              1.  Set |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}} to 0, and its
                  {{network reporting endpoint/retry_after}} to `null`.

              2.  Remove each <a>report</a> in |reports| from the <a>reporting
                  cache</a>.

              Otherwise, if |result| is "`Remove Endpoint`":

              1.  Remove |endpoint| from the reporting cache.

                  Note: |reports| remain in the reporting cache for potential
                  delivery to other endpoints.

              Otherwise (if |result| is "`Failure`"):

              1.  Increment |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}}.

              2.  Set |endpoint|'s {{network reporting endpoint/retry_after}} to
                  a point in the future which the user agent chooses.

                  Note: We don't specify a particular algorithm here, but user
                  agents are encouraged to employ some sort of exponential
                  backoff algorithm which increases the retry period with the
                  number of failures, with the addition of some random jitter to
                  ensure that temporary failures don't lead to a crush of
                  reports all being retried on the same schedule.

                  ISSUE: Add in a reasonable reference describing a good
                  algorithm.  Wikipedia, if nothing else.

  Note: User agents MAY decide to attempt delivery for only a subset of the
  collected reports or endpoints (because, for example, sending all the reports
  at once would consume an unreasonable amount of bandwidth, etc). As reports
  are only removed from the cache when they're successfully delivered, skipped
  reports will simply be delivered later.

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

  The user agent SHOULD attempt to deliver reports as soon as possible to
  provide feedback to developers as quickly as possible. However, when this
  desire is balanced against the impact on the user, the user wins. With that
  in mind, the user agent MAY delay delivery of reports based on its knowledge
  of the user's activities and context.

  For instance, the user agent SHOULD prioritize the transmission of reporting
  data lower than other network traffic. The user's explicit activities on a
  website should preempt reporting traffic.

  The user agent MAY choose to withhold report delivery entirely until the user
  is on a fast, cheap network in order to prevent unnecessary data cost.

  The user agent MAY choose to prioritize reports from particular origins over
  others (perhaps those that the user visits most often?)

  <h3 id="gc">Garbage Collection</h3>

  Periodically, the user agent SHOULD walk through the cached <a>reports</a>
  and <a for="/" data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a>, and discard those that are no
  longer relevant. These include:

  *   <a>endpoint groups</a> which are <a for="endpoint group">expired</a>.
  *   <a>endpoint groups</a> which have not been used in some arbitrary
      period of time (perhaps a ~week?)
  *   <a>reports</a> whose [=report/attempts=] exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable.)
  *   <a>reports</a> which have not been delivered in some arbitrary period of
      time (perhaps ~2 days?)

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="capability-urls">Capability URLs</h3>

  Some URLs are valuable in and of themselves. To mitigate the possibility
  that such URLs will be leaked via this reporting mechanism, we strip out
  credential information and fragment data from the URL we store as a
  <a>report</a>'s originator. It is still possible, however, for a feature
  to unintentionally leak such data via a report's [=report/body=]. Implementers
  SHOULD ensure that URLs contained in a report's body are similarly stripped.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="network-leakage">Network Leakage</h3>

  Because this reporting mechanism is out-of-band, and doesn't rely on a page
  being open, it's entirely possible for a report generated while a user is on
  one network to be sent while the user is on another network, even if they
  don't explicitly open the page from which the report was sent.

  ISSUE(w3c/BackgroundSync#107): Consider mitigations. For example, we could
  drop reports if we change from one network to another.

  <h3 id="fingerprinting-clock-skew">Clock Skew</h3>

  Each report is delivered along with an `age` property, rather than the
  timestamp at which it was generated. We do this because each user's local
  clock will be skewed from the clock on the server by an arbitrary amount.
  The difference between the time the report was generated and the time it
  was sent will be stable, regardless of clock skew, and we can avoid the
  fingerprinting risk of exposing the clock skew via this API.

  <h3 id="correlation">Cross-origin correlation</h3>

  If multiple origins all use the same reporting endpoint, that endpoint may
  learn that a particular user has interacted with a certain set of websites,
  as it will receive origin-tagged reports from each. This doesn't seem worse
  than the status quo ability to track the same information from cooperative
  origins, and doesn't grant any new tracking ability above and beyond what's
  possible with `<img>` today.

  <h3 id="subdomains">Subdomains</h3>

  This specification allows any resource on a host to declare a set of reporting
  endpoints for that host and each of its subdomains. This doesn't have privacy
  implications in and of itself (beyond those noted in [[#clear-cache]]), as the
  reporting endpoints themselves don't take any real action, as features will
  need to opt-into using these reporting endpoints explicitly. Those features
  certainly will have privacy implications, and should carefully consider
  whether they should be enabled across origin boundaries.

  <h3 id="clear-cache">Clearing the reporting cache</h3>

  A user agent's <a>reporting cache</a> contains data about a user's activity
  on the web, and user agents ought to handle this data carefully. In
  particular, if a user agent gives users the ability to clear their site data,
  browsing history, browsing cache, or similar, the user agent MUST also clear
  the <a>reporting cache</a>. Note that this includes both the pending reports
  themselves, as well as the endpoints to which they would be sent. Both MUST
  be cleared.

  <h3 id="disable">Disabling Reporting</h3>

  Reporting is, to some extent, a question of commons. In the aggregate, it
  seems useful for everyone for reports to be delivered. There is direct benefit
  to developers, as they can fix bugs, which means there's indirect benefit to
  users, as the sites they enjoy will be more stable and enjoyable. As a
  concrete example, Content Security Policy grants something like herd immunity
  to cross-site scripting attacks by alerting developers about potential holes
  in their sites' defenses. Fixing those bugs helps every user, even those whose
  user agents don't support Content Security Policy.

  The calculus, of course, depends on the nature of data that's being delivered,
  and the relative maliciousness of the reporting endpoints, but that's the
  value proposition in broad strokes.

  That said, it can't be the case that this general benefit be allowed to take
  priority over the ability of a user to individually opt-out of such a system.
  Sending reports costs bandwidth, and potentially could reveal some small
  amount of additional information above and beyond what a website can obtain
  in-band ([[NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING]], for instance). User agents MUST allow
  users to disable reporting with some reasonable amount of granularity in order
  to maintain the priority of constituencies espoused in
  [[HTML-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]].
