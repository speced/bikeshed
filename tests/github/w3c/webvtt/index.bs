<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT</dfn> (Web Video Text Tracks) format is intended for marking up external text
track resources in connection with the HTML &lt;track> element.</p>

<p>WebVTT files provide captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions
[[MAUR]], chapters for content navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is
time-aligned with audio or video content.</p>

<p>The majority of the current version of this specification is dedicated to describing how to use
WebVTT files for captioning or subtitling. There is minimal information about chapters and
time-aligned metadata and nothing about video descriptions at this stage.</p>

<p>In this section we provide some example WebVTT files as an introduction.</p>


<h3 id=introduction-caption>A simple caption file</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>The main use for WebVTT files is captioning or subtitling video content. Here is a sample file
that captions an interview:</p>

<pre>
WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We are in New York City

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We're actually at the Lucern Hotel, just down the street

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>from the American Museum of Natural History

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And with me is Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Astrophysicist, Director of the Hayden Planetarium

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>at the AMNH.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Thank you for walking down here.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And I want to do a follow-up on the last conversation we did.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.500 align:right size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>When we e-mailed&mdash;

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500 align:left size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>Didn't we talk about enough in that conversation?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.500 align:right size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>No! No no no no; 'cos 'cos obviously 'cos

00:32.500 --> 00:33.500 align:left size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>&lt;i>Laughs&lt;/i>

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>You know I'm so excited my glasses are falling off here.
</pre>

<p>You can see that a WebVTT file in general consists of a sequence of text segments associated with
a time-interval, called a cue (<a lt="WebVTT cue">definition</a>). Beyond captioning and subtitling,
WebVTT can be used for time-aligned metadata, typically in use for delivering name-value pairs in
cues. WebVTT can also be used for delivering chapters, which helps with contextual navigation around
an audio/video file. Finally, WebVTT can be used for the delivery of text video descriptions, which
is text that describes the visual content of time-intervals and can be synthesized to speech to help
vision-impaired users understand context.</p>

<p class=note>This version of WebVTT focuses on solving the captioning and subtitling use cases.
More specification work is possible for the other use cases. A decision on what type of use case a
WebVTT file is being used for is made by the software that is using the file. For example, if in use
with a HTML file through a &lt;track> element, the <a lt="text track kind">kind</a> attribute
defines how the WebVTT file is to be interpreted.</p>

<p>The following subsections provide an overview of some of the key features of the WebVTT file
format, particularly when in use for captioning and subtitling.</p>


<h3 id=introduction-multiple-lines>Caption cues with multiple lines</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>Line breaks in cues are honored. User agents will also insert extra line breaks if necessary to
fit the cue in the cue's width. In general, therefore, authors are encouraged to write cues all on
one line except when a line break is definitely necessary.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>These captions on a public service announcement video demonstrate line breaking:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
 Never drink liquid nitrogen.

 00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
 &mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
 &mdash; You could die.

 00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 The Organisation for Sample Public Service Announcements accepts no liability for the content of this advertisement, or for the consequences of any actions taken on the basis of the information provided.
 </pre>

 <p>The first cue is simple, it will probably just display on one line. The second will take two
 lines, one for each speaker. The third will wrap to fit the width of the video, possibly taking
 multiple lines. For example, the three cues could look like this:</p>

 <!-- 50 -->
 <pre>
 &nbsp;          <samp>Never drink liquid nitrogen.</samp>

         <samp>&mdash; It will perforate your stomach.</samp>
                 <samp>&mdash; You could die.</samp>

     <samp>The Organisation for Sample Public Service</samp>
     <samp>Announcements accepts no liability for the</samp>
     <samp>content of this advertisement, or for the</samp>
      <samp>consequences of any actions taken on the</samp>
         <samp>basis of the information provided.</samp>
 </pre>

 <p>If the width of the cues is smaller, the first two cues could wrap as well, as in the following
 example. Note how the second cue's explicit line break is still honored, however:</p>

 <!-- 25 -->
 <pre>
 &nbsp;     <samp>Never drink</samp>
     <samp>liquid nitrogen.</samp>

   <samp>&mdash; It will perforate</samp>
       <samp>your stomach.</samp>
     <samp>&mdash; You could die.</samp>

   <samp>The Organisation for</samp>
   <samp>Sample Public Service</samp>
   <samp>Announcements accepts</samp>
   <samp>no liability for the</samp>
      <samp>content of this</samp>
   <samp>advertisement, or for</samp>
    <samp>the consequences of</samp>
   <samp>any actions taken on</samp>
     <samp>the basis of the</samp>
   <samp>information provided.</samp>
 </pre>

 <p>Also notice how the wrapping is done so as to keep the line lengths balanced.</p>

</div>


<h3 id=styling>Styling captions</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>CSS style sheets that apply to an HTML page that contains a <a element>video</a> element can
target WebVTT cues and regions in the video using the ''::cue'', ''::cue()'', ''::cue-region'' and
''::cue-region()'' pseudo-elements.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, an HTML page has a CSS style sheet in a <a element>style</a> element that
 styles all cues in the video with a gradient background and a text color, as well as changing the
 text color for all <a>WebVTT Bold Objects</a> in cues in the video.</p>

 <pre>
 &lt;!doctype html>
 &lt;html>
  &lt;head>
   &lt;title>Styling WebVTT cues&lt;/title>
   &lt;style>
    video::cue {
      background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
      color: papayawhip;
    }
    video::cue(b) {
      color: peachpuff;
    }
   &lt;/style>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
   &lt;video controls autoplay src="video.webm">
    &lt;track default src="track.vtt">
   &lt;/video>
  &lt;/body>
 &lt;/html>
 </pre>

</div>

<p>CSS style sheets can also be embedded in WebVTT files themselves.</p>

<p>Style blocks are placed after any headers but before the first cue, and start with the line
"STYLE". Comment blocks can be interleaved with style blocks.</p>

<p>Blank lines cannot appear in the style sheet. They can be removed or be filled with a space or a
CSS comment (e.g. <code>/**/</code>).</p>

<p>The string "<code>--></code>" cannot be used in the style sheet. If the style sheet is wrapped in
"<code>&lt;!--</code>" and "<code>--></code>", then those strings can just be removed. If
"<code>--></code>" appears inside a CSS string, then it can use CSS escaping e.g.
"<code>--\></code>".</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>This example shows how cues can be styled with style blocks in WebVTT.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 STYLE
 ::cue {
   background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
   color: papayawhip;
 }
 /* Style blocks cannot use blank lines nor "dash dash greater than" */

 NOTE comment blocks can be used between style blocks.

 STYLE
 ::cue(b) {
   color: peachpuff;
 }

 hello
 00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello &lt;b>world&lt;/b>.

 NOTE style blocks cannot appear after the first cue.
 </pre>

</div>

<h3 id=introduction-other-features>Other caption and subtitling features</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>WebVTT also supports some less-often used features.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, the cues have an identifier:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 test
 00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 This is a test.

 123
 00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 That's an, an, that's an L!

 crédit de transcription
 00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
 Transcrit par Célestes&trade;
 </pre>

 <p>This allows a style sheet to specifically target the cues.</p>

 <pre>
 /* style for cue: test */
 ::cue(#test) { color: lime; }
 </pre>

 <p>Due to the syntax rules of CSS, some characters need to be escaped with CSS character escape
 sequences. For example, an ID that starts with a number 0-9 needs to be escaped. The ID
 <code>123</code> can be represented as "\31 23" (31 refers to the Unicode code point for "1"). See
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes">Using character escapes in markup
 and CSS</a> for more information on CSS escapes.</p>

 <pre>
 /* style for cue: 123 */
 ::cue(#\31 23) { color: lime; }
 /* style for cue: crédit de transcription */
 ::cue(#crédit\ de\ transcription) { color: red; }
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

 <p>This example shows how classes can be used on elements, which can be helpful for localization or
 maintainability of styling, and also how to indicate a language change in the cue text.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 04:02.500 --> 04:05.000
 J'ai commencé le basket à l'âge de 13, 14 ans

 04:05.001 --> 04:07.800
 Sur les &lt;i.foreignphrase>&lt;lang en>playground&lt;/lang>&lt;/i>, ici à Montpellier
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, each cue says who is talking using voice spans. In the first cue, the span
 specifying the speaker is also annotated with two classes, "first" and "loud". In the third cue,
 there is also some italics text (not associated with a specific speaker). The last cue is annotated
 with just the class "loud".</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 &lt;v.first.loud Esme>It's a blue apple tree!

 00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 &lt;v Mary>No way!

 00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 &lt;v Esme>Hee!&lt;/v> &lt;i>laughter&lt;/i>

 00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 &lt;v.loud Mary>That's awesome!
 </pre>

 <p>Notice that as a special exception, the voice spans don't have to be closed if they cover the
 entire cue text.</p>

 <p>Style sheets can style these spans:</p>

 <pre>
 ::cue(v[voice="Esme"]) { color: cyan }
 ::cue(v[voice="Mary"]) { color: lime }
 ::cue(i) { font-style: italic }
 ::cue(.loud) { font-size: 2em }
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">
 <p>This example shows how to position cues at explicit positions in the video viewport.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000 position:10%,line-left align:left size:35%
 Where did he go?

 00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:90% align:right size:35%
 I think he went down this lane.

 00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:45%,line-right align:center size:35%
 What are you waiting for?
 </pre>

 <p>Since the cues in these examples are horizontal, the "position" setting refers to a percentage
 of the width of the video viewpoint. If the text were vertical, the "position" setting would refer
 to the height of the video viewport.</p>

 <p>The "line-left" or "line-right" only refers to the physical side of the box to which the
 "position" setting applies, in a way which is agnostic regarding the horizontal or vertical
 direction of the cue. It does not affect or relate to the direction or position of the text itself
 within the box.</p>

 <p>The cues cover only 35% of the video viewport's width - that's the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue
 box</a>'s "size" for all three cues.</p>

 <p>The first cue has its <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> positioned at the 10% mark. The
 "line-left" and "line-right" within the "position" setting indicates which side of the <a
 lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> the position refers to. Since in this case the text is horizontal,
 "line-left" refers to the left side of the box, and the cue box is thus positioned between the 10%
 and the 45% mark of the video viewport's width, probably underneath a speaker on the left of the
 video image. If the cue was vertical, "line-left" positioning would be from the top of the video
 viewport's height and the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> would cover 35% of the video
 viewport's height.</p>

 <p>The text within the first cue's cue box is aligned using the "align" cue setting. For
 left-to-right rendered text, "start" alignment is the left of that box, for right-to-left rendered
 text the right of the box. So, independent of the directionality of the text, it will stay
 underneath that speaker. Note that "center" position alignment of the cue box is the default for
 start aligned text, in order to avoid having the box move when the base direction of the text
 changes (from left-to-right to right-to-left or vice versa) as a result of translation.</p>

 <p>The second cue has its <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> right aligned at the 90% mark of the
 video viewport width ("right" aligned text right aligns the box). The same effect can be achieved
 with "position:55%,line-left", which explicitly positions the cue box. The third cue has center
 aligned text within the same positioned cue box as the first cue.</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
 <p>This example shows two regions containing rollup captions for two different speakers. Fred's
 cues scroll up in a region in the left half of the video, Bill's cues scroll up in a region on the
 right half of the video. Fred's first cue disappears at 12.5sec even though it is defined until
 20sec because its region is limited to 3 lines and at 12.5sec a fourth cue appears:</p>

<h3 id=introduction-comments>Comments in WebVTT</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>Comments can be included in WebVTT files.</p>

<p>Comments are just blocks that are preceded by a blank line, start with the word
"<code>NOTE</code>" (followed by a space or newline), and end at the first blank line.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>Here, a one-line comment is used to note a possible problem with a cue.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
 Never drink liquid nitrogen.

 NOTE I'm not sure the timing is right on the following cue.

 NOTE
 This file was written by Jill. I hope
 you enjoy reading it. Some things to
 bear in mind:
 - I was lip-reading, so the cues may
 not be 100% accurate
 - I didn't pay too close attention to
 when the cues should start or end.

<h3 id=introduction-chapters>Chapters example</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>A WebVTT file can consist of chapters, which are navigation markers for the video.</p>

<p>Chapters are plain text, typically just a single line.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, a talk is split into each slide being a chapter.</p>

<h3 id=introduction-metadata>Metadata example</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>A WebVTT file can consist of time-aligned metadata.</p>

<p>Metadata can be any string and is often provided as a JSON construct.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot provide blank lines inside a metadata block, because the blank line
signifies the end of the WebVTT cue.</p>

<h2 id=conformance>Conformance</h2>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative
parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in
the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY"
and "OPTIONAL". For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this
specification. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space
characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>


<h3 id=conformance-classes>Conformance classes</h3>

<p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for user agents (relevant to implementors)
and <a>WebVTT files</a> (relevant to authors and authoring tool implementors).</p>

<p class=note>[[#syntax]] defines what consists of a valid <a>WebVTT file</a>. Authors need to
follow the requirements therein, and are encouraged to use a conformance checker. [[#parsing]]
defines how user agents are to interpret a file labelled as <a>text/vtt</a>, for both valid and
invalid <a>WebVTT files</a>. The parsing rules are more tolerant to author errors than the syntax
allows, in order to provide for extensibility and to still render cues that have some syntax
errors.</p>

<p class=example>For example, the parser will create two cues even if the blank line between them is
skipped. This is clearly a mistake, so a conformance checker will flag it as an error, but it is
still useful to render the cues to the user.</p>

<p>User agents fall into several (possibly overlapping) categories with different conformance
requirements.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>User agents that support scripting</dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply. The user agent must also be
 conforming implementations of the IDL fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL
 specification. [[!WEBIDL]]</p></dd>

 <dt>User agents with no scripting support</dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply, except those in
 [[#dom-construction-rules]] and [[#api]].</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn>User agents that do not support CSS</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply, except parts of [[#parsing]] that
 relate to stylesheets and CSS, and all of [[#rendering]] and [[#css-extensions]]. The user agent
 must instead only render the text inside <a>WebVTT caption or subtitle cue text</a> in an
 appropriate manner and specifically support the color classes defined in [[#default-classes]]. Any
 other styling instructions are optional.</p> </dd>

 <dt><dfn>User agents that do not support a full HTML CSS engine</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply, including the color classes defined
 in [[#default-classes]]. However, the user agent will need to apply the CSS related features in
 [[#parsing]], [[#rendering]] and [[#css-extensions]] in such a way that the rendered results are
 equivalent to what a full CSS supporting renderer produces.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn>User agents that support a full HTML CSS engine</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply. However, only a limited set of CSS
 styles is allowed because <a>user agents that do not support a full HTML CSS engine</a> will need
 to implement CSS functionality equivalents. User agents that support a full CSS engine must
 therefore limit the CSS styles they apply for WebVTT so as to enable identical rendering without
 bleeding in extra CSS styles that are beyond the WebVTT specification.</p></dd>

 <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>
 <dd><p>Conformance checkers must verify that a <a>WebVTT file</a> conforms to the applicable
 conformance criteria described in this specification. The term "validator" is equivalent to
 conformance checker for the purpose of this specification.</p></dd>

 <dt>Authoring tools</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Authoring tools must generate conforming <a>WebVTT files</a>. Tools that convert other formats
  to <a>WebVTT</a> are also considered to be authoring tools.</p>

  <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming <a>WebVTT file</a>, it may preserve the
  conformance errors in sections of the file that were not edited during the editing session (i.e.
  an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool must not
  claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>


<h3 id=unicode-normalization>Unicode normalization</h3>

<p>Implementations of this specification must not normalize Unicode text during processing.</p>

<p class=example>For example, a cue with an identifier consisting of the characters U+0041 LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER A followed by U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE (a decomposed character sequence), or the
character U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN (a compatibility character), will not match a selector targeting a
cue with an ID consisting of the character U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (a
precomposed character).</p>


<h2 id=data-model>Data model</h2>
<!-- Describe metadata, caption/subtitle, chapter & description cues -->

<p class=note>The box model of WebVTT consists of three key elements: the video viewport, cues, and
regions. The video viewport is the rendering area into which cues and regions are rendered. Cues are
boxes consisting of a set of cue lines. Regions are subareas of the video viewport that are used to
group cues together. Cues are positioned either inside the video viewport directly or inside a
region, which is positioned inside the video viewport.</p>

<p class=note>The position of a cue inside the video viewport is defined by a set of cue settings.
The position of a region inside the video viewport is defined by a set of region settings. Cues that
are inside regions can only use a limited set of their cue settings. Specifically, if the cue has a
"vertical", "line" or "size" setting, the cue drops out of the region. Otherwise, the cue's width is
calculated to be relative to the region width rather than the viewport. </p>

<h3 id=model-overview>Overview</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>The WebVTT file is a container file for chunks of data that are time-aligned with a video or
audio resource. It can therefore be regarded as a serialisation format for time-aligned data.</p>

<p>A WebVTT file starts with a header and then contains a series of data blocks. If a data block has
a start and end time, it is called a WebVTT cue. A comment is another kind of data block.</p>

<p>Different kinds of data can be carried in WebVTT files. The HTML specification identifies
captions, subtitles, chapters, audio descriptions and metadata as data kinds and specifies which one
is being used in the <a>text track kind</a> attribute of the <a>text track</a> element
[[!HTML]].</p>

<p>A WebVTT file must only contain data of one kind, never a mix of different kinds of data. The
data kind of a WebVTT file is externally specified, such as in a HTML file's <a>text track</a>
element. The environment is responsible for interpreting the data correctly.</p>

<p>WebVTT caption or subtitle cues are rendered as overlays on top of a video viewport or into a
region, which is a subarea of the video viewport.</p>

<h3 id=model-cues>WebVTT cues</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT cue</dfn> is a <a>text track cue</a> [[!HTML]] that additionally consist of the
following: </p>

<dl>

 <dt><dfn lt="cue text">A cue text</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>The raw text of the cue, and rules for its interpretation.</p>

 </dd>

</dl>


<h3 id=cues>WebVTT caption or subtitle cues</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT caption or subtitle cue</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT cue</a> that has the following
additional properties allowing the <a>cue text</a> to be rendered and converted to a DOM
fragment:</p>

<dl>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT cue box">A cue box</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>The cue box of a <a>WebVTT cue</a> is a box within which the text of all lines of the cue is to
  be rendered. It is either rendered into the video's viewport or a region inside the viewport if
  the cue is part of a region.</p>

  <p class="note">The position of the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> within the video viewport's
  or region's dimensions depends on the value of the <a>WebVTT cue position</a> and the <a>WebVTT
  cue line</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Lines are wrapped within the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a>'s <a lt="WebVTT
  cue size">size</a> if lines' lengths make this necessary.</p>

 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT cue writing direction">A writing direction</dfn></dt>

  </ul>

  <p class=note>The <a lt="WebVTT cue writing direction">writing direction</a> affects the

 <dd>
  <p>The <a lt="WebVTT cue line">line</a> defines positioning of the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue

  <p>By default, the <a lt="WebVTT cue line">line</a> is set to <a lt="WebVTT cue line

  <p>If the <a lt="WebVTT cue writing direction">writing direction</a> is <a lt="WebVTT cue

    <p class="note">Although the <a>WebVTT parser</a> will not set the <a lt="WebVTT cue

   <li><p>If the <a>WebVTT cue snap-to-lines flag</a> of the <a>WebVTT cue</a> is false, return the

   <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT cue end alignment">End alignment</dfn></dt>
   <dd>The text of each line is individually aligned towards the end side of the box, where the end

   <dd>The text is aligned to the box's right side (for <a lt="WebVTT cue horizontal writing

  </dl>

  <p>By default, the <a lt="WebVTT cue text alignment">text alignment</a> is set to <a lt="WebVTT
  cue center alignment">center</a>.</p>

  <p class=note>The base direction of each line in a cue (which is used by the Unicode Bidirectional
  Algorithm to determine the order in which to display the characters in the line) is determined by
  looking up the first strong directional character in each line, using the CSS
  ''unicode-bidi/plaintext'' algorithm. In the occasional cases where the first strong character on
  a line would produce the wrong base direction for that line, the author can use an U+200E
  LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK or U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK character at the start of the line to correct it.
  [[!BIDI]]</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, the second cue will have a right-to-left base direction, rendering as
   "<samp><bdo dir=ltr>.I think ,&#x064A;&#x0644;&#x0627;&#x0639;</bdo></samp>". (Note that the text
   below shows all characters left-to-right; a text editor would not necessarily have the same
   rendering.)</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
   What was his name again?

   00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
   <bdo dir=ltr>&#x0639;&#x0627;&#x0644;&#x064A;, I think.</bdo>
   </pre>

   <p>To change that line to left-to-right base direction, start the line with an U+200E
   LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK character (it can be escaped as "<code>&amp;lrm;</code>").</p>
  </div>

  <p class=note>Where the base direction of some embedded text within a line needs to be different
  from the surrounding text on that line, this can be achieved by using the paired Unicode bidi
  formatting code characters.</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, assuming no bidi formatting code characters are used, the cue text is
   rendered as "<samp><bdo dir=ltr>I've read the book 3 &#x5D3;&#x5E0;&#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D5;&#x5E0;
   times!</bdo></samp>" (i.e. the "3" is on the wrong side of the book title) because of the effect
   of the Unicode Bidirection Algorithm. (Again, the text below shows all characters
   left-to-right.)</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
   <bdo dir=ltr>I've read the book &#x5E0;&#x5D5;&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5E0;&#x5D3; 3 times!</bdo>
   </pre>

   <p>If a U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE (FSI) character was placed before the book title and a U+2069
   POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE (PDI) character after it, the rendering would be the intended "<samp><bdo
   dir=ltr>I've read the book &#x5D3;&#x5E0;&#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D5;&#x5E0; 3 times!</bdo></samp>".
   (Those characters can be escaped as "<code>&amp;#x2068;</code>" and "<code>&amp;#x2069;</code>",
   respectively.)</p>
  </div>

  <p class=note>The default text alignment is <a lt="WebVTT cue center alignment">center
  alignment</a> regardless of the base direction of the cue text. To make the text alignment of each
  line match the base direction of the line (e.g. left for English, right for Hebrew), use <a
  lt="WebVTT cue start alignment">start alignment</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT cue end alignment">end
  alignment</a> for the opposite alignment.</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, <a lt="WebVTT cue start alignment">start alignment</a> is used. The first
   line is left-aligned because the base direction is left-to-right, and the second line is
   right-aligned because the base direction is right-to-left.</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 align:start
   Hello!
   <bdo dir=ltr>&#x5E9;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5DD;!</bdo>
   </pre>

   <p>This would render as follows:</p>

   <!-- 50 -->
   <pre>
   <samp>Hello!</samp>
                                               <samp><bdo dir=ltr>!&#x5DD;&#x5D5;&#x5DC;&#x5E9;</bdo></samp>
   </pre>
  </div>

  <p class=note>The <a lt="WebVTT cue left alignment">left alignment</a> and <a lt="WebVTT cue right

<h3 id=regions>WebVTT caption or subtitle regions</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region</dfn> represents a subpart of the video viewport and provides a limited
rendering area for <a lt="WebVTT caption or subtitle cue">WebVTT caption or subtitle cues</a>.</p>

<p class=note>Regions provide a means to group caption or subtitle cues so the cues can be rendered
together, which is particularly important when scrolling up.</p>

<p>Each <a>WebVTT region</a> consists of:</p>

<dl>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region identifier">An identifier</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>An arbitrary string of zero or more characters other than U+0020 SPACE or U+0009 CHARACTER
  TABULATION character. The string must not contain the substring "-->" (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D
  HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN). Defaults to the empty string.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region width">A width</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>A number giving the width of the box within which the text of each line of the containing cues
  is to be rendered, to be interpreted as a percentage of the video width. Defaults to 100.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region lines">A lines value</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>A number giving the number of lines of the box within which the text of each line of the
  containing cues is to be rendered. Defaults to 3.</p>

  <p class="note">Since a WebVTT region defines a fixed rendering area, a cue that has more lines
  than the region allows will be clipped. For scrolling regions, the clipping happens at the top,
  for non-scrolling regions it happens at the bottom.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region anchor">A region anchor point</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Two numbers giving the x and y coordinates within the region which is anchored to the video
  viewport and does not change location even when the region does, e.g. because of font size
  changes. Defaults to (0,100), i.e. the bottom left corner of the region.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region viewport anchor">A region viewport anchor point</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Two numbers giving the x and y coordinates within the video viewport to which the region anchor
  point is anchored. Defaults to (0,100), i.e. the bottom left corner of the video viewport.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region scroll">A scroll value</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>One of the following:</p>
  <dl>
   <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region scroll none">None</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Indicates that the cues in the region are not to scroll and instead stay fixed at the
   location they were first painted in.</dd>

   <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT region scroll up">Up</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Indicates that the cues in the region will be added at the bottom of the region and push any
   already displayed cues in the region up until all lines of the new cue are visible in the
   region.</dd>
   <!-- in the future we may introduce scroll="down"-->
  </dl>
 </dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
 <p>The following diagram illustrates how anchoring of a region to a video viewport works. The black
 cross is the anchor, orange explains the anchor's offset within the region and green the anchor's

 <p id=regionsExplained>Image description: Within the video viewport, there is a WebVTT region.
 Inside the region, there is an anchor point marked with a black cross. The vertical and horizontal
 distance from the video viewport's edges to the anchor is marked with green arrows, representing
 the region viewport anchor X and Y offsets. The vertical and horizontal distance from the region's
 edges to the anchor is marked with orange arrows, representing the region anchor X and Y offsets.
 The size of the region is represented by the region width for the horizontal axis, and region lines

<h3 id=region-settings>WebVTT region settings</h3>

<p>A <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> can contain a reference to a <a>WebVTT region</a>. To define a
region, a <a>WebVTT region definition block</a> is specified.</p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT region settings list</dfn> consists of zero or more of the following components,
in any order, separated from each other by one or more U+0020 SPACE characters, U+0009 CHARACTER
TABULATION (tab) characters, or <a>WebVTT line terminators</a>, except that the string must not
contain two consecutive <a>WebVTT line terminators</a>. Each component must not be included more
than once per <a>WebVTT region settings list</a> string.</p>

<ul>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region identifier setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region width setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region lines setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region anchor setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region viewport anchor setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region scroll setting</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region settings list</a> gives configuration options regarding the
dimensions, positioning and anchoring of the region. For example, it allows a group of cues within a
region to be anchored in the center of the region and the center of the video viewport. In this
example, when the font size grows, the region grows uniformly in all directions from the center.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region identifier setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>id</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>An arbitrary string of one or more characters other than <a>ASCII whitespace</a>. The string
 must not contain the substring "<code>--></code>" (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E
 GREATER-THAN SIGN).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A <a>WebVTT region identifier setting</a> must be unique amongst all the <a lt="WebVTT region
identifier setting">WebVTT region identifier settings</a> of all <a lt="WebVTT region">WebVTT
regions</a> of a <a>WebVTT file</a>.</p>

<p>A <a>WebVTT region identifier setting</a> must be present in each <a>WebVTT cue settings
list</a>. Without an identifier, it is not possible to associate a <a>WebVTT cue</a> with a
<a>WebVTT region</a> in the syntax.</p>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region identifier setting</a> gives a name to the region so it can be
referenced by the cues that belong to the region.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region width setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>width</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region width setting</a> provides a fixed width as a percentage of the
video width for the region into which cues are rendered and based on which alignment is
calculated.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region lines setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>lines</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>One or more <a>ASCII digits</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region lines setting</a> provides a fixed height as a number of lines
for the region into which cues are rendered. As such, it defines the height of the roll-up region if
it is a scroll region.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region anchor setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>regionanchor</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+002C COMMA character (,).</p></li>
 <li><p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region anchor setting</a> provides a tuple of two percentages that
specify the point within the region box that is fixed in location. The first percentage measures the
x-dimension and the second percentage y-dimension from the top left corner of the region box. If no
<a>WebVTT region anchor setting</a> is given, the anchor defaults to 0%, 100% (i.e. the bottom left
corner).</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region viewport anchor setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the
order given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>viewportanchor</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+002C COMMA character (,).</p></li>
 <li><p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region viewport anchor setting</a> provides a tuple of two percentages
that specify the point within the video viewport that the region anchor point is anchored to. The
first percentage measures the x-dimension and the second percentage measures the y-dimension from
the top left corner of the video viewport box. If no region viewport anchor is given, it defaults to
0%, 100% (i.e. the bottom left corner).</p>

<p class="note">For browsers, the region maps to an absolute positioned CSS box relative to the
video viewport, i.e. there is a relative positioned box that represents the video viewport relative
to which the regions are absolutely positioned. Overflow is hidden.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region scroll setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>scroll</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>The string "<code>up</code>".</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region scroll setting</a> specifies whether cues rendered into the
region are allowed to move out of their initial rendering place and roll up, i.e. move towards the
top of the video viewport. If the scroll setting is omitted, cues do not move from their rendered
position.</p>

<p class="note">Cues are added to a region one line at a time below existing cue lines. When an
existing rendered cue line is removed, and it was above another already rendered cue line, that cue
line moves into its space, thus scrolling in the given direction. If there is not enough space for a
new cue line to be added to a region, the top-most cue line is pushed off the visible region (thus
slowly becoming invisible as it moves into overflow:hidden). This eventually makes space for the new
cue line and allows it to be added.</p>

<p class="note">When there is no scroll direction, cue lines are added in the empty line closest to
the line in the bottom of the region. If no empty line is available, the oldest line is
replaced.</p>


<h3 id=cue-settings>WebVTT cue settings</h3>

<p>A <a>WebVTT cue setting</a> is part of a <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> and provides
configuration options regarding the position and alignment of the cue box and the cue text
within.</p>

<p class="note">For example, a set of WebVTT cue settings may allow a cue box to be aligned to the
left or positioned at the top right with the cue text within center aligned.</p>

<p>The current available <a>WebVTT cue settings</a> that may appear in a <a>WebVTT cue settings
list</a> are:</p>

<ul class="brief">
 <li>A <a>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT size cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT alignment cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region cue setting</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these setting must not be included more than once per <a>WebVTT cue settings
list</a>.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT cue setting</a> that consists of the
following components, in the order given:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The string "<code>vertical</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>One of the following strings as the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: "<code>rl</code>",
 "<code>lr</code>".</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</a> configures the cue to use vertical text
layout rather than horizontal text layout. Vertical text layout is sometimes used in Japanese, for
example. The default is horizontal layout.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT line cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>line</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>
  As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>:

     "<code>end</code>"</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a> configures the offset of the cue box from the video
viewport's edge in the direction orthogonal to the <a lt="WebVTT cue writing direction">writing
direction</a>. For horizontal cues, this is the vertical offset from the top of the video viewport,
for vertical cues, it's the horizontal offset. The offset is for the <a lt="WebVTT cue line start
alignment">start</a>, <a lt="WebVTT cue line center alignment">center</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT cue line
end alignment">end</a> of the cue box, depending on the <a>WebVTT cue line alignment</a> value - <a
lt="WebVTT cue line start alignment">start</a> by default. The offset can be given either as a
percentage of the relevant writing-mode dependent video viewport dimension or as a line number. Line
numbers are based on the size of the first line of the cue. Positive line numbers count from the
start of the video viewport (the first line is numbered 0), negative line numbers from the end of
the video viewport (the last line is numbered &#x2212;1).</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT position cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>position</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>
  As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>:
  <ol>
   <li>a position value consisting of: a <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</li>

     <li>One of the following strings: "<code>line-left</code>", "<code>center</code>",
     "<code>line-right</code>"</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a> configures the indent position of the <a
lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> in the direction orthogonal to the <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a>.
For horizontal cues, this is the horizontal position. The cue position is given as a percentage of
the video viewport. The positioning is for the <a lt="WebVTT cue position line-left
alignment">line-left</a>, <a lt="WebVTT cue position center alignment">center</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT
cue position line-right alignment">line-right</a> of the cue box, depending on the cue's <a lt="cue

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT size cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>size</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: a <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT size cue setting</a> configures the size of the <a lt="WebVTT cue
box">cue box</a> in the same direction as the <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a>. For horizontal
cues, this is the width of the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a>. It is given as a percentage of
the width of the video viewport.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT alignment cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order

 "<code>center</code>", "<code>end</code>", "<code>left</code>", "<code>right</code>"</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT alignment cue setting</a> configures the alignment of the text within
the cue. The "<code>start</code>" and "<code>end</code>" keywords are relative to the cue text's
lines' base direction; for left-to-right English text, "<code>start</code>" means left-aligned.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>region</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: a <a>WebVTT region identifier</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A <a>WebVTT region cue setting</a> configures a cue to become part of a region by referencing the
region's identifier unless the cue has a <a lt="WebVTT vertical text cue setting">"vertical"</a>, <a
lt="WebVTT line cue setting">"line"</a> or <a lt="WebVTT size cue setting">"size"</a> cue setting.
If a cue is part of a region, its cue settings for <a lt="WebVTT position cue

<h3 id=properties-of-cue-sequences>Properties of cue sequences</h3>


<h4 id=file-using-only-nested-cues>WebVTT file using only nested cues</h4>

<p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all follow the following rules is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file
using only nested cues</dfn>:</p>

<p>given any two cues |cue1| and |cue2| with start and end time offsets (|x1|, |y1|) and (|x2|,
|y2|) respectively,</p>

<ul>
 <li>either |cue1| lies fully within |cue2|, i.e. |x1| >= |x2| and |y1| &lt;= |y2|</li>
 <li>or |cue1| fully contains |cue2|, i.e. |x1| &lt;= |x2| and |y1| >= |y2|.</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">

 <p>The following example matches this definition:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 01:24.000
 Introduction

 00:00.000 --> 00:44.000
 Topics

 00:44.000 --> 01:19.000
 Presenters

 01:24.000 --> 05:00.000
 Scrolling Effects

 01:35.000 --> 03:00.000
 Achim's Demo

 03:00.000 --> 05:00.000
 Timeline Panel
 </pre>

 <p>Notice how you can express the cues in this WebVTT file as a tree structure:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   WebVTT file
   <ul>
    <li>
     Introduction
     <ul>
      <li>Topics</li>
      <li>Presenters</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Scrolling Effects
     <ul>
      <li>Achim's Demo</li>
      <li>Timeline Panel</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>If the file has cues that can't be expressed in this fashion, then they don't match the
 definition of a <a>WebVTT file using only nested cues</a>. For example:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 01:00.000
 The First Minute

 00:30.000 --> 01:30.000
 The Final Minute
 </pre>

 <p>In this ninety-second example, the two cues partly overlap, with the first ending before the
 second ends and the second starting before the first ends. This therefore is not a <a>WebVTT file
 using only nested cues</a>.</p>

</div>


<h3 id=types-of-webvtt-files>Types of WebVTT files</h3>

<p>The syntax definition of WebVTT files allows authoring of a wide variety of WebVTT files with a
mix of cues. However, only a small subset of WebVTT file types are typically authored.</p>

<p>Conformance checkers, when validating <a>WebVTT files</a>, may offer to restrict syntax checking
for validating these types.</p>

<h4 id=file-using-metadata-content>WebVTT file using metadata content</h4>

<p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all have a <a>cue payload</a> that is <a>WebVTT metadata text</a>
is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file using metadata content</dfn>.</p>

<h4 id=file-using-chapter-title-text>WebVTT file using chapter title text</h4>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT file using chapter title text</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT file using only nested cues</a>
whose cues all have a <a>cue payload</a> that is <a>WebVTT chapter title text</a>.</p>


<h4 id=file-using-cue-text>WebVTT file using caption or subtitle cue text</h4>

<p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all have a <a>cue payload</a> that is <a>WebVTT caption or
subtitle cue text</a> is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file using caption or subtitle cue text</dfn>.</p>


<h2 id=default-classes>Default classes for WebVTT Caption or Subtitle Cue Components</h2>

<p>Many captioning formats have simple ways of specifying a limited subset of text colors and
background colors for text. Therefore, the WebVTT spec makes available a set of default <a>cue
component class names</a> for <a>WebVTT caption or subtitle cue components</a> that authors can use
in a standard way to mark up colored text and text background.</p>

<p class=note>User agents that support CSS style sheets may implement this section through adding
User Agent stylesheets.</p>

<p><a>WebVTT caption or subtitle cue components</a> that have one or more <a lt="cue component class
names">class names</a> matching those in the first cell of a row in the table below must set their

<p class=note>If your background is captioning, don't get confused: The color for the class

608/708).</p>

<p class=note>Do not use the classes <code>blue</code> and <code>black</code> on the default dark
background, since they result in unreadable text. In general, please refer to WCAG for guidance on
color contrast [[WCAG20]] and make sure to take into account the text color, background color and
also the video's color.</p>

<h2 id=parsing>Parsing</h2>

<p>WebVTT file parsing is the same for all types of WebVTT files, including captions, subtitles,
chapters, or metadata. Most of the steps will be skipped for chapters or metadata files.</p>


<h3 id=file-parsing algorithm>WebVTT file parsing</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT parser</dfn>, given an input byte stream, a <a>text track list of cues</a>
|output|, and a collection of <a spec=cssom>CSS style sheets</a> |stylesheets|, must decode the byte
stream using the <a lt="UTF-8 decode">UTF-8 decode</a> algorithm, and then must parse the resulting
string according to the <a>WebVTT parser algorithm</a> below. This results in <a>WebVTT cues</a>
being added to |output|, and <a spec=cssom>CSS style sheets</a> being added to |stylesheets|.
[[!RFC3629]]</p>

<p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a>, specifically its conversion and parsing steps, is typically run
asynchronously, with the input byte stream being updated incrementally as the resource is
downloaded; this is called an <dfn>incremental WebVTT parser</dfn>.</p>

<p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a> verifies a file signature before parsing the provided byte stream. If the
stream lacks this WebVTT file signature, then the parser aborts.</p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT parser algorithm</dfn> is as follows:</p>

<ol algorithm="WebVTT parser algorithm">

 <li>
  <p>Let |input| be the string being parsed, after conversion to Unicode, and with the following
  transformations applied:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>Replace all U+0000 NULL characters by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace each U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair by a single
   U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace all remaining U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters by U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   characters.</p></li>

  </ul>

 </li>

 <li><p>Let |position| be a pointer into |input|, initially pointing at the start of the string. In
 an <a>incremental WebVTT parser</a>, when this algorithm (or further algorithms that it uses) moves
 the |position| pointer, the user agent must wait until appropriate further characters from the byte
 stream have been added to |input| before moving the pointer, so that the algorithm never reads past
 the end of the |input| string. Once the byte stream has ended, and all characters have been added
 to |input|, then the |position| pointer may, when so instructed by the algorithms, be moved past
 the end of |input|.</p></li>

 <li>Let |seen cue| be false.</li>

 <!-- SIGNATURE CHECK -->

 <li><p>If |input| is less than six characters long, then abort these steps. The file does not start
 with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not successfully
 processed.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |input| is exactly six characters long but does not exactly equal "<code>WEBVTT</code>",
 then abort these steps. The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and
 was therefore not successfully processed.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |input| is more than six characters long but the first six characters do not exactly
 equal "<code>WEBVTT</code>", or the seventh character is not a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009
 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, or a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, then abort these steps.
 The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not
 successfully processed.</p></li>

 <li><p><a>collect a sequence of code points</a> that are <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
 characters.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |position| is past the end of |input|, then abort these steps. The file was successfully
 processed, but it contains no useful data and so no <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> were added
 to |output|.</p></li>

 <li><p>The character indicated by |position| is a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character. Advance
 |position| to the next character in |input|.</p></li>

 processed, but it contains no useful data and so no <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> were added

 <li><p><i>Header</i>: If the character indicated by |position| is not a U+000A LINE FEED (LF)

 advance |position| to the next character in |input|.</p></li>

 <li><p><a>collect a sequence of code points</a> that are U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |regions| be an empty <a>text track list of regions</a>.</p></li>

 <li>

  <p><i>Block loop</i>: While |position| doesn't point past the end of |input|:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><a>Collect a WebVTT block</a>, and let |block| be the returned value.</p></li>

   <li><p>If |block| is a <a>WebVTT cue</a>, add |block| to the <a>text track list of cues</a>
   |output|.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if |block| is a <a spec=cssom>CSS style sheet</a>, add |block| to
   |stylesheets|.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if |block| is a <a>WebVTT region object</a>, add |block| to |regions|.</p></li>

   <!-- handle new block types here -->

   <li><p><a>collect a sequence of code points</a> that are U+000A LINE FEED (LF)

  </ol>

 </li>

 <li><p><i>End</i>: The file has ended. Abort these steps. The <a>WebVTT parser</a> has finished.
 The file was successfully processed.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>When the algorithm above says to <dfn>collect a WebVTT block</dfn>, optionally with a flag <i>in
header</i> set, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

|position| to the next character in |input|. When it says to unconsume a character, it means to move

in this specification. Finally, this context is <em>not</em> "as part of an attribute" (when it

<h2 id=rendering>Rendering</h2>

<p class="note">This section describes in some detail how to visually render <a>WebVTT caption or
subtitle cues</a> in a user agent. The processing model is quite tightly linked to media elements in
HTML, where CSS is available. <a>User agents that do not support CSS</a> are expected to render
plain text only, without styling and positioning features. <a>User agents that do not support a full
HTML CSS engine</a> are expected to render an equivalent visual representation to what a user agent
with a full CSS engine would render.</p>


<h3 id=processing-model algorithm>Processing model</h3>

<p>The <dfn>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</dfn> render the <a>text tracks</a>
of a <a>media element</a> (specifically, a <a element>video</a> element), or of another playback
mechanism, by applying the steps below. All the <a lt="text track">text tracks</a> that use these
rules for a given <a>media element</a>, or other playback mechanism, are rendered together, to avoid
overlapping subtitles from multiple tracks. A fallback language |language| may be set when calling
this algorithm.</p>

<p class="note">In HTML, audio elements don't have a visual rendering area and therefore, this
algorithm will abort for audio elements. When authors do create WebVTT captions or subtitles for
audio resources, they need to publish them in a video element for rendering by the user agent.</p>

<p>The output of the steps below is a set of CSS boxes that covers the rendering area of the
<a>media element</a> or other playback mechanism, which user agents are expected to render in a
manner suiting the user.</p>

<p>The rules are as follows:</p>

<ol algorithm="rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks">

 <li><p>If the <a>media element</a> is an <a element>audio</a> element, or is another playback
 mechanism with no rendering area, abort these steps.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |video| be the <a>media element</a> or other playback mechanism.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |output| be an empty list of absolutely positioned CSS block boxes.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the user agent is <a lt="expose a user interface to the user">exposing a user
 interface</a> for |video|, add to |output| one or more completely transparent positioned CSS block
 boxes that cover the same region as the user interface.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the last time these rules were run, the user agent was not <a lt="expose a user interface
 to the user">exposing a user interface</a> for |video|, but now it is, optionally let |reset| be
 true. Otherwise, let |reset| be false.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |tracks| be the subset of |video|'s <a>list of text tracks</a> that have as their
 <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> these <a>rules for updating the display of
 WebVTT text tracks</a>, and whose <a>text track mode</a> is <a lt="text track
 showing">showing</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |cues| be an empty list of <a lt="text track cue">text track cues</a>.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>Apply the following steps for each |regionNode|:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Prepare some variables for the application of CSS properties to |regionNode| as follows:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>Let |regionWidth| be the <a>WebVTT region width</a>. Let |width| be
     ''|regionWidth|&#x2009;vw'' (''vw'' is a CSS unit). [[!CSS-VALUES]]</p></li>

     <li><p>Let |viewportAnchorX| be the x dimension of the <a>WebVTT region anchor</a> and

    </ul>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Apply the terms of the CSS specifications to |regionNode| within the following constraints,
    thus obtaining a CSS box |box| positioned relative to an initial containing block:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>No style sheets are associated with |regionNode|. (The regionNodes are subsequently

<h3 id=obtaining-css-boxes algorithm>Obtaining CSS boxes</h3>

<p>When the processing algorithm above requires that the user agent <dfn>obtain a set of CSS
boxes</dfn> |boxes|, then apply the terms of the CSS specifications to |nodes| within the following
constraints: [[!CSS22]]</p>

<ul>

 <li><p>The <i>document tree</i> is the tree of <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a>
 rooted at |nodes|.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>For the purpose of selectors in STYLE blocks of a WebVTT file, the style sheet must apply to a
  hypothetical document that contains a single empty element with no explicit name, no namespace, no
  attributes, no classes, no IDs, and unknown primary language, that acts like the <a>media
  element</a> for the <a>text tracks</a> that were sourced from the given WebVTT file. The selectors
  must not match other <a>text tracks</a> for the same <a>media element</a>. In this hypothetical
  document, the element must not match any selector that would match the element itself.</p>

  <p class=note>This element exists only to be the <a spec=selectors>originating element</a> for the
  ''::cue'', ''::cue()'', ''::cue-region'' and ''::cue-region()'' pseudo-elements.</p>
 </li>

 <li>
  <p>For the purpose of determining the <a spec=css-cascade>cascade</a> of the declarations in STYLE
  blocks of a WebVTT file, the relative order of appearance of the style sheets must be the same
  order as they were added to the collection, and the order of appearance of the collection must be
  after any style sheets that apply to the associated <a element>video</a> element's document.</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>For example, given the following (invalid) HTML document:</p>

   <pre>
   &lt;!doctype html>
   &lt;title>Invalid cascade example&lt;/title>
   &lt;video controls autoplay src="video.webm">
    &lt;track default src="track.vtt">
   &lt;/video>
   &lt;style>
    ::cue { color:red }
   &lt;/style>
   </pre>

   <p>...and the "track.vtt" file contains:</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   STYLE
   ::cue { color:lime }

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
   Red or green?
   </pre>

   <p>The ''color:lime'' declaration would win, because it is last in the <a
   spec=css-cascade>cascade</a>, even though the <a element>style</a> element is after the <a
   element>video</a> element in the document order.</p>
  </div>
 </li>

 <li>

  <p id=style-no-external-resources>For the purpose of resolving URLs in STYLE blocks of a WebVTT
  file, or any URLs in resources referenced from STYLE blocks of a WebVTT file, if the URL's scheme
  is not "<code>data</code>", then the user agent must act as if the URL failed to resolve.</p>

  <p><strong class=advisement>Supporting external resources with ''@import'' or 'background-image'
  would be a new ability for <a>media elements</a> and <a element>track</a> elements to issue
  network requests as the user watches the video, which could be a privacy issue.</strong></p>

 </li>

 <li><p>For the purposes of processing by the CSS specification, <a lt="WebVTT Internal Node
 Object">WebVTT Internal Node Objects</a> are equivalent to elements with the same
 contents.</p></li>

 <li>For the purposes of processing by the CSS specification, <a lt="WebVTT Text Object">WebVTT Text
 Objects</a> are equivalent to {{Text}} nodes.</li>

 <li>No style sheets are associated with |nodes|. (The nodes are subsequently restyled using style
 sheets after their boxes are generated, as described below.)</li>

 <li>The children of the |nodes| must be wrapped in an anonymous box whose 'display' property has
 the value ''display/inline''. This is the <dfn>WebVTT cue background box</dfn>.</li>

 <li>Runs of children of <a lt="WebVTT Ruby Object">WebVTT Ruby Objects</a> that are not <a
 lt="WebVTT Ruby Text Object">WebVTT Ruby Text Objects</a> must be wrapped in anonymous boxes whose
 'display' property has the value ''display/ruby-base''. [[!CSS3-RUBY]]</li>

 <li>Properties on <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a> have their values set as
 defined in the next section. (That section uses some of the variables whose values were calculated
 earlier in this algorithm.)</li>

 <li>Text runs must be wrapped according to the CSS line-wrapping rules.</li>

 <li>The video viewport (and initial containing block) is |video|'s rendering area.</li>

</ul>

<p>Let |boxes| be the boxes generated as descendants of the initial containing block, along with
their positions.</p>


<h3 id=applying-css-properties algorithm>Applying CSS properties to <a lt="WebVTT Node
Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a></h3>

<p>When following the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>, user agents must
set properties of <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a> at the CSS user agent cascade
layer as defined in this section. [[!CSS22]]</p>

<p>Initialize the (root) <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> with the following CSS settings:</p>

<p>All other non-inherited properties must be set to their initial values; inherited properties on
the root <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> must inherit their values from the <a>media element</a>
for which the <a>WebVTT cue</a> is being rendered, if any. If there is no <a>media element</a> (i.e.
if the <a>text track</a> is being rendered for another media playback mechanism), then inherited
properties on the root <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> and the <a lt="WebVTT region

<p>When a user agent is rendering one or more <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> according to the
<a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>, <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node

certain pseudo-selectors as defined below. These selectors can begin or stop matching individual <a

rendered, even in between applications of the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text
tracks</a> (which are only run when the set of active cues changes). User agents that support the
pseudo-element described below must dynamically update renderings accordingly. When either
'white-space' or one of the properties corresponding to the 'font' shorthand (including
'line-height') changes value, then the <a>WebVTT cue</a>'s <a>text track cue display state</a> must
be emptied and the <a>text track</a>'s <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> must be
immediately rerun.</p>

<p>Pseudo-elements apply to elements that are matched by selectors. For the purpose of this section,
that element is the <i>matched element</i>. The pseudo-elements defined in the following sections
affect the styling of parts of <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> that are being rendered for the
<i>matched element</i>.</p>

<p class="note">If the <i>matched element</i> is not a <a element>video</a> element, the
pseudo-elements defined below won't have any effect according to this specification.</p>

<p>A CSS user agent that implements the <a>text tracks</a> model must implement the ''::cue'',
''::cue(|selector|)'', ''::cue-region'' and ''::cue-region(|selector|)'' pseudo-elements, and the
'':past'' and '':future'' pseudo-classes.</p>


<h4 id=the-cue-pseudo-element>The ''::cue'' pseudo-element</h4>

<p>The <dfn>::cue</dfn> pseudo-element (with no argument) matches any <a>list of WebVTT Node
Objects</a> constructed for the <i>matched element</i>, with the exception that the properties
corresponding to the 'background' shorthand must be applied to the <a>WebVTT cue background box</a>
rather than the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>.</p>

<p>The following properties apply to the ''::cue'' pseudo-element with no argument; other properties
set on the pseudo-element must be ignored:</p>

<h2 class="no-num" id=privacy-and-security-considerations>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>


<h3 id=fromat-security>Text-based format security</h3>

<p>As with any text-based format, it is possible to construct malicious content that might cause
buffer over-runs, value overflows (e.g. string representations of integers that overflow a given
word length), and the like. Implementers should take care in implementing a parser that over-long
lines, field values, or encoded values do not cause security problems.</p>

<h3 id=styling-security>Styling-related privacy and security</h3>

<p>WebVTT can embed CSS style sheets, which will be applied in user agents that support CSS. Under
these circumstances, the privacy and security considerations of CSS apply, with the following
caveats.</p>

<p>Such style sheets <a href="#style-no-external-resources">cannot fetch any external resources</a>,
and it is important for privacy that user agents do not allow this. Otherwise, WebVTT files could be
authored such that a third party is notified when the user watches a particular video, and even the
current time in that video.</p>

<p>It is possible for a user agent to offer user style sheets, but their presence and nature will
not be detectable by scripts running in the same user agent (e.g. browser) since the CSS object
model for such style sheets is not exposed to script and there is no way to get the computed style
for pseudo-elements other than ''::before'' and ''::after'' with the {{Window/getComputedStyle()}}
API. [[!CSSOM]]</p>

<h3 id=scripting-security>Scripting-related security</h3>

<p>WebVTT does not include or enable scripting. It is important that user agents do not support a
way to execute script embedded in a WebVTT file.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to construct and deliver a file that is designed not to present captions
or subtitles, but instead to provide timed input (‘triggers’) to a script system. A
poorly-written script or script system might then cause security, privacy or other problems;
however, this consideration really applies to the script system. Since WebVTT supplies these
triggers at their timestamps, a malicious file might present such triggers very rapidly, perhaps
causing undue resource consumption.</p>

<h3 id=privacy-of-preference>Privacy of preference</h3>

<p>A user agent that selects, and causes to download or interpret a WebVTT file, might indicate to
the origin server that the user has a need for captions or subtitles, and also the <a lt="honor user
preferences for automatic text track selection">language preference</a> of the user for captions or
subtitles. That is a (small) piece of information about the user. However, the offering of a caption
file, and the choice whether to retrieve and consume it, are really characteristics of the format or
protocol which does the offer (e.g. the HTML element), rather than of the caption format itself.
