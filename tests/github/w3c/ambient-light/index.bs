Introduction {#intro}
============

The Ambient Light Sensor extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
to provide information about ambient light levels,
as detected by the device's main light detector, in terms of lux units.

Scope {#scope}
-----

This document specifies an API designed for [[#usecases-requirements|use cases]]
which require fine grained illuminance data, with low latency, and possibly
sampled at high frequencies.

Common use cases relying on a small set of illuminance values, such as styling
webpages according to ambient light levels are best served by the the
`light-level` CSS media feature [[MEDIAQUERIES-5]] and its accompanying
`matchMedia` API [[CSSOM]] and are out of scope of this API.

Note: it might be worthwhile to provide a <a>high-level</a> Light Level Sensor
which would mirror the `light-level` media feature, but in JavaScript.
This sensor would *not require additional user permission to be activated*
in user agents that exposed the `light-level` media feature.

Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    In this simple example, ambient light sensor is created with
    default configuration. Whenever a new [=sensor readings|reading=] is available,
    it is printed to the console.

    <pre highlight="js">
    const sensor = new AmbientLightSensor();
    sensor.onreading = () => console.log(sensor.illuminance);
    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    sensor.start();
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
    In this example, the exposure value (EV) at ISO 100 is calculated from
    the ambient light [=sensor readings=]. Initially, we check that the user
    agent has permissions to access ambient light [=sensor readings=]. Then,
    the {{AmbientLightSensor/illuminance!!attribute}} value is converted to the
    closest exposure value.

    <pre highlight="js">
    navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'ambient-light-sensor' }).then(result => {
        if (result.state === 'denied') {
            console.log('Permission to use ambient light sensor is denied.');
            return;
        }

        const als = new AmbientLightSensor({frequency: 20});
        als.addEventListener('activate', () => console.log('Ready to measure EV.'));
        als.addEventListener('error', event => console.log(\`Error: ${event.error.name}\`));
        als.addEventListener('reading', () => {
            // Defaut ISO value.
            const ISO = 100;
            // Incident-light calibration constant.
            const C = 250;

            let EV = Math.round(Math.log2((als.illuminance * ISO) / C));
            console.log(\`Exposure Value (EV) is: ${EV}\`);
        });

        als.start();
    });
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
    This example demonstrates how ambient light [=sensor readings=] can be mapped
    to recommended workplace light levels.

    <pre highlight="js">
    const als = new AmbientLightSensor();

    als.onreading = () => {
        let str = luxToWorkplaceLevel(als.illuminance);
        if (str) {
            console.log(\`Light level is suitable for: ${str}.\`);
        }
    };

    als.start();

    function luxToWorkplaceLevel(lux) {
        if (lux > 20 && lux < 100) {
            return 'public areas, short visits';
        } else if (lux > 100 && lux < 150) {
            return 'occasionally performed visual tasks';
        } else if (lux > 150 && lux < 250) {
            return 'easy office work, classes, homes, theaters';
        } else if (lux > 250 && lux < 500) {
            return 'normal office work, groceries, laboratories';
        } else if (lux > 500 && lux < 1000) {
            return 'mechanical workshops, drawing, supermarkets';
        } else if (lux > 1000 && lux < 5000) {
            return 'detailed drawing work, visual tasks of low contrast';
        }

        return;
    }
    </pre>
</div>

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

Ambient Light Sensor provides information about lighting conditions near
the device environment. Potential privacy risks include:

  - Profiling. Ambient Light Sensor can leak information about user's use
    patterns and surrounding. This information can be used to enhance user
    profiling and behavioral analysis.
  - Cross-device linking. Two devices can access web sites that include the
    same third-party script that correlates lighting levels over time.
  - Cross-device communication. A simple broadcast communication method can
    use device screen or camera LED flashes to broadcast messages read
    out with an Ambient Light Sensor in a close by device.
  - Cross-origin leaks. Light emitted from the screen can be reflected back to
    the sensor from nearby reflective surfaces. Malicious sites can embed
    resources from different origins and scale the content to display
    particular pixels to allow distinguishing the contents, pixel by pixel.
  - Hijacking browsing history. Styling visited links to allow distinguishing
    the light levels associated with visited and unvisited links i.e. visited
    links styled as a block of black screen; white for unvisited.

To mitigate these Ambient Light Sensor specific threats, user agents should
use one or both of the following mitigation strategies:
  - <a>limit maximum sampling frequency</a>
  - <a>reduce accuracy</a> of sensor readings

These mitigation strategies complement the [=mitigation strategies|generic mitigations=]
defined in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The <dfn>Ambient Light Sensor</dfn> <a>sensor type</a>'s associated {{Sensor}}
subclass is the {{AmbientLightSensor}} class.

The <a>Ambient Light Sensor</a> has a <a>default sensor</a>,
which is the device's main light detector.

The <a>Ambient Light Sensor</a> has an associated [=sensor permission name=]
which is <a for="PermissionName" enum-value>"ambient-light-sensor"</a>.

The <dfn>current light level</dfn> or <dfn>illuminance</dfn>
is a value that represents the ambient light level
around the hosting device. Its unit is the lux (lx) [[SI]].

Note: The precise lux value reported by
different devices in the same light can be different,
due to differences in detection method, sensor construction, etc.

API {#api}
===

The AmbientLightSensor Interface {#ambient-light-sensor-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions sensorOptions), SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
  interface AmbientLightSensor : Sensor {
    readonly attribute double? illuminance;
  };
</pre>

To construct an {{AmbientLightSensor}} object the user agent must invoke the
[=construct an ambient light sensor object=] abstract operation.

### The illuminance attribute ### {#ambient-light-sensor-reading-attribute}

The <a attribute for="AmbientLightSensor">illuminance</a> attribute of the {{AmbientLightSensor}}
interface represents the [=current light level=] and returns the result of invoking
[=get value from latest reading=] with `this` and "illuminance" as arguments.

Abstract Operations {#abstract-operations}
===================

<h3 dfn export>Construct an ambient light sensor object</h3>

<div algorithm="construct an ambient light sensor object">

    : input
    :: |options|, a {{SensorOptions}} object.
    : output
    :: An {{AmbientLightSensor}} object.

    1.  Let |allowed| be the result of invoking [=check sensor policy-controlled features=]
        with {{AmbientLightSensor}}.
    1.  If |allowed| is false, then:
        1.  [=Throw=] a {{SecurityError}} {{DOMException}}.
    1.  Let |ambient_light_sensor| be the new {{AmbientLightSensor}} object.
    1.  Invoke [=initialize a sensor object=] with |ambient_light_sensor| and |options|.
    1.  Return |ambient_light_sensor|.
</div>

Automation {#automation}
==========
This section extends the [=automation=] section defined in the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
to provide mocking information about the ambient light levels for the purposes of testing a user agent's
implementation of [=Ambient Light Sensor=].


<h3 id="mock-ambient-light-sensor-type">Mock Sensor Type</h3>

The {{AmbientLightSensor}} class has an associated [=mock sensor type=] which is
<a for="MockSensorType" enum-value>"ambient-light"</a>, its [=mock sensor reading values=]
dictionary is defined as follows:

<pre class="idl">
  dictionary AmbientLightReadingValues {
    required double? illuminance;
  };
</pre>

Use Cases and Requirements {#usecases-requirements}
=========

- A Web application provides input for a smart home system to control lighting.
- A Web aplication checks whether light level at work space is sufficient.
- A Web application calculates settings for a camera with manual controls (apperture, shutter speed, ISO).
- A Web application monitors light level changes produced by hovering hand user gesture and
  interprets them to control a game character.

While some of the use cases may benefit from obtaining precise ambient light measurements, the use
cases that convert ambient light level fluctuations to user input events would benefit from
higher [=sampling frequency|sampling frequencies=].

Conformance {#conformance}
===========

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
"MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]

A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> must implement all the requirements
listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.

The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for
conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
