Introduction {#intro}
=====================

In early 2018, Spectre made it clear that a foundational security boundary the web aimed to
maintain was substantially less robust than expected. [[SPECTRE]] This revelation has pushed web
browsers to shift their focus from the platform-level [=origin=] boundary to an OS-level
process boundary. Chromium's threat model, for instance, now asserts that "active web content …
will be able to read any and all data in the address space of the process that hosts it".
[[POST-SPECTRE-RETHINK]] This shift in thinking imposes a shift in development practice, both
for browser vendors, and for web developers. Browsers need to align the origin boundary with the
process boundary through fundamental refactoring projects (for example, [[SITE-ISOLATION]] and
[[PROJECT-FISSION]]). Moreover, browsers must provide web developers with tools to mitigate risk
in the short term, and should push the platform towards safe default behaviors in the long term.
The bad news is that this is going to be a lot of work, much of it falling on the shoulders of
web developers. The good news is that a reasonable set of mitigation primitives exists today,
ready and waiting for use.

This document will summarize the threat model which the Web Application Security Working Group
espouses, point to a set of mitigations which seem promising, and provide concrete recommendations
for developers responsible for protecting users' data.

Threat Model {#threat-model}
----------------------------

Spectre-like side-channel attacks inexorably lead to a model in which active web content
(JavaScript, WASM, probably CSS if we tried hard enough, and so on) can read any and all data which
has entered the address space of the process which hosts it. While this has deep implications for
user agent implementations' internal hardening strategies (stack canaries, ASLR, etc), here we'll
remain focused on the core implication at the web platform level, which is both simple and profound:
any data which flows into a process hosting a given origin is legible to that origin. We must design
accordingly.

In order to determine the scope of data that can be assumed accessible to an attacker, we must make
a few assumptions about the normally-not-web-exposed process model which the user agent implements.
The following seems like a good place to start:

1.  User agents are capable of separating the execution of a web origin's code into a process
    distinct from the agent's core. This separation enables the agent itself to access local
    devices, fetch resources, broker cross-process communication, and so on, in a way which remains
    invisible to any process potentially hosting untrusted code.

2.  User agents are able to make decisions about whether or not a given resource should be delivered
    to a process hosting a given origin based on characteristics of both the request and the
    response (headers, etc).

3.  User agents can consistently separate top-level, cross-origin windows into distinct processes.
    They cannot consistently separate same-site or same-origin windows into distinct processes given
    the potential for synchronous access between the windows.

4.  User agents cannot yet consistently separate framed origins into processes distinct from their
    embedders' origin.
    
    Note: Though some user agents support out-of-process frames [[OOPIF]], no agent supports it
    consistently across a broad range of devices and platforms. Ideally this will change over time,
    as the frame boundary *must* be one we can eventually consider robust.

With this in mind, our general assumption will be that an origin gains access to any resource which
it renders (including images, stylesheets, scripts, frames, etc). Likewise, embedded frames gain
access to their ancestors' content.

ISSUE: [[COI-THREAT-MODEL]] spells out more implications. Bring them in here for more nuance.

TL;DR {#tldr}
-------------

1.  **Decide when (not!) to respond to requests** by examining incoming headers, paying special
    attention to the <a http-header>`Origin`</a> header on the one hand, and various `Sec-Fetch-`
    prefixed headers on the other, as described in [[resource-isolation-policy]].

2.  **Restrict attackers' ability to load your data as a subresource** by setting a
    [=cross-origin resource policy=] (CORP) of `same-origin` (opening up to `same-site`
    or `cross-origin` only when necessary).

3.  **Restrict attackers' ability to frame your data as a document** by opt-ing into framing
    protections via `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` or CSP's more granular [=frame-ancestors=]
    directive (`frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted.embedder`, for example).

4.  **Restrict attackers' ability to obtain a handle to your window** by setting a
    [=cross-origin opener policy=] (COOP). In the best case, you can default to a restrictive
    `same-origin` value, opening up to `same-origin-allow-popups` or `unsafe-none` only if
    necessary.

5.  **Prevent MIME-type confusion attacks** and increase the robustness of passive defenses like
    [=cross-origin read blocking=] (CORB) /
    <a href="https://github.com/annevk/orb">opaque response blocking</a> ([[ORB]]) by setting
    correct `Content-Type` headers, and globally asserting `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

Practical Examples {#examples}
==============================

Subresources {#subresources}
----------------------------

Resources which are intended to be loaded into documents should protect themselves from being used
in unexpected ways. Before walking through strategies for specific kinds of resources, a few headers
seem generally applicable:

1.  Sites should use Fetch Metadata to make good decisions about when to serve resources, as
    described in [[resource-isolation-policy]]. In order to ensure that decision sticks, servers
    should explain its decision to the browser by sending a <a http-header>`Vary`</a> header
    containing `Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User`. This ensures that
    the server has a chance to make different decisions for requests which will be *used*
    differently.

2.  Subresources should opt-out of MIME type sniffing by sending an
    <a http-header>`X-Content-Type-Options`</a> header with a value of `nosniff`. This increases the
    robustness of MIME-based checks like [=cross-origin read blocking=] (CORB) /
    <a href="https://github.com/annevk/orb">opaque response blocking</a> ([[ORB]]), and mitigates
    some well-known risks around type confusion for scripts.

3.  Subresources are intended for inclusion in a given context, not as independently navigable
    documents. To mitigate the risk that navigation to a subresource causes script execution or
    opens an origin up to attack in some other way, servers can assert the following set of headers
    which collectively make it difficult to meaningfully abuse a subresource via navigation:

    *   Using the <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header's to assert the
        <a>`sandbox`</a> directive ensures that these resources remain inactive if navigated to
        directly as a top-level document. No scripts will execute, and the resource will be pushed
        into an [=opaque origin=].

        Note: Some servers deliver `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.name` to obtain
        a similar effect. This was valuable to mitigate vulnerabilities in Flash, but the sandbox
        approach seems to more straightforwardly address the threats we care about today.

    *   Asserting the <a http-header>`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`</a> header with a value of
        `same-origin` prevents cross-origin documents from retaining a handle to the resource's
        window if it's opened in a popup.

    *   The <a http-header>`X-Frame-Options`</a> header with a value of `DENY` prevents the resource
        from being framed.

Most subresources, then, should contain the following block of headers, which you'll see repeated a
few times below:    

<pre highlight="http">
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
</pre>

With these generic protections in mind, let's sift through a few scenarios to determine what headers
a server would be well-served to assert:

### Static Subresources ### {#static-subresources}

By their nature, static resources contain the same data no matter who requests them, and therefore
cannot contain interesting information that an attacker couldn't otherwise obtain. There's no risk
to making these resources widely available, and value in allowing embedders to robustly debug, so
something like the following response headers could be appropriate:

<pre highlight="http">
<strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
Timing-Allow-Origin: *</strong>
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
</pre>

Note: Purely static resources always respond with the same data, no matter the request. There's
therefore little benefit to sending a `Vary` header: it can be safely omitted for these responses.

CDNs are the canonical static resource distribution points, and many use the pattern above. Take
a look at the following common resources' response headers for inspiration:

* <a href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js">`https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js`</a>
* <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js">`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js`</a>
* <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.5.1/dist/jquery.min.js">`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.5.1/dist/jquery.min.js`</a>
* <a href="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js">`https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js`</a>

Similarly, application-specific static resource servers are a good place to look for this practice. Consider:

* <a href="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y2/r/zVvRrO8pOtu.png">`https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y2/r/zVvRrO8pOtu.png`</a>
* <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googlelogo/svg/googlelogo_clr_74x24px.svg">`https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googlelogo/svg/googlelogo_clr_74x24px.svg`</a>

### Dynamic Subresources ### {#dynamic-subresources}

Subresources that contain data personalized to a given user are juicy targets for attackers, and
must be defended by ensuring that they're loaded only in ways that are appropriate for the data
in question. A few cases are well worth considering:

1.  Application-internal resources (private API endpoints, avatar images, uploaded data, etc.)
    should not be available to any cross-origin requestor. These resources should be restricted to
    usage as a subresource in same-origin contexts by sending a
    <a http-header>`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`</a> header with a value of `same-origin`:
    
    <pre highlight="http">
	  <strong>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin</strong>
    Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    </pre>

    This header will prevent cross-origin attackers from loading the resource as a response to a
    `no-cors` request.

    For example, examine the headers returned when requesting endpoints like the following:
    
    *   <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/_/AccountSettingsUi/browserinfo">`https://myaccount.google.com/_/AccountSettingsUi/browserinfo`</a>
    *   <a href="https://twitter.com/i/api/1.1/branch/init.json">`https://twitter.com/i/api/1.1/branch/init.json`</a>
    *   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajax/webstorage/process_keys/?state=0">`https://www.facebook.com/ajax/webstorage/process_keys/?state=0`</a>

2.  Personalized resources intended for cross-origin use (public API endpoints, etc) should
    carefully consider incoming requests' properties before responding. These endpoints can only
    safely be enabled by requiring CORS, and choosing the set of origins for which a given response
    can be exposed by setting the appropriate access-control headers, for example:

    <pre highlight="http">
    <strong>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted.example
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ...
    Access-Control-Allow-...: ...
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin</strong>
    Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    </pre>

    Note: The `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` header is only processed for requests that are _not_
    using CORS for access control ("`no-cors` requests"). Sending
    `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` is therefore not harmful, and works to ensure that
    `no-cors` usage isn't accidentally allowed.
    
    For example, examine the headers returned when requesting endpoints like the following:
    
    *   <a href="https://api.twitter.com/1.1/jot/client_event.json">`https://api.twitter.com/1.1/jot/client_event.json`</a>
    *   <a href="https://play.google.com/log?format=json&hasfast=true">`https://play.google.com/log?format=json&hasfast=true`</a>
    *   <a href="https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view">`https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view`</a>
    *   <a href="https://c.amazon-adsystem.com/e/dtb/bid">`https://c.amazon-adsystem.com/e/dtb/bid`</a>

3.  Personalized resources that are intended for cross-origin `no-cors` embedding, but which don't
    intend to be directly legible in that context (avatar images, authenticated media, etc). These
    should enable cross-origin embedding via `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, but _not_ via CORS
    access control headers:

    <pre highlight="http">
    <strong>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin</strong>
    Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    </pre>

    <div class="note">
        Note: That this allows the resource to be used by any cross-origin document. That's
        reasonable for some use cases, but requiring CORS, and opting-in a small set of origins via
        appropriate access-control headers is a possible alternative for some resources. This
        approach will give those contexts trivial access to the resource's bits, so the granularity
        is a tradeoff. Still, considering this case to be the same as the "personalized resources
        intended for cross-origin use" isn't unreasonable.

        ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#760): If we implemented more granular bindings for CORP headers (along
        the lines of `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: https://trusted.example`), we could avoid this
        tradeoff entirely.
    </div>


    For example:

    *   <a href="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1JBUaX1xSOZRxBk5bRNZWgnzyJoCQC52TIRokACBSmGc=w512">`https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1JBUaX1xSOZRxBk5bRNZWgnzyJoCQC52TIRokACBSmGc=w512`</a>


Documents {#documents}
----------------------

### Fully-Isolated Documents ### {#documents-isolated}

Documents that require users to be signed-in almost certainly contain information that shouldn't be
revealed to attackers. These pages should take care to isolate themselves from other origins, both
by making _a priori_ decisions about whether to serve the page at all (see
[[resource-isolation-policy]], for example), and by giving clients careful instructions about how
the page can be used once delivered. For instance, something like the following set of response
headers could be appropriate:

<pre highlight="http">
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
</pre>

Note: Documents which need to make use of APIs that require full cross-origin isolation (such
as {{SharedArrayBuffer}}), will also need to serve a `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header, as
outlined in [[coop-coep]] and [[cross-origin-isolation-guide]].

Account settings pages, admin panels, and application-specific documents are all good examples of
resources which would benefit from as much isolation as possible. For real-life examples, consider:

*   <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">`https://myaccount.google.com/`</a>


### Documents Expecting to Open Cross-Origin Windows ### {#documents-with-popups}

Not every document that requires sign-in can be fully-isolated from the rest of the internet. It's
often the case that partial isolation is a better fit. Consider sites that depend upon cross-origin
windows for federated workflows involving payments or sign-in, for example. These pages would
generally benefit from restricting attackers' ability to embed them, or obtain their window handle,
but they can't easily lock themselves off from all such vectors via
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. In these cases, something
like the following set of response headers might be appropriate:

<pre highlight="http">
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
</pre>

The only difference between this case and the "Fully-Isolated" case above is the
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` value. `same-origin` will break the opener relationship between the
document and any cross-origin window, regardless of who opened whom.
`same-origin-allow-popups` will break cross-origin opener relationships initiated by a cross-origin
document's use of `window.open()`, but will allow the asserting document to open cross-origin
windows that retain an opener relationship.


### Documents Expecting Cross-Origin Openers ### {#documents-as-popups}

Federated sign-in forms and payment providers are clear examples of documents which intend to be
opened by cross-origin windows, and require that relationship to be maintained in order to
facilitate communication via channels like {{Window/postMessage(message, options)}} or navigation.
These documents cannot isolate themselves completely, but can prevent themselves from being embedded
or fetched cross-origin. Three scenarios are worth considering:

1.  Documents that only wish to be opened in cross-origin popups could loosen their cross-origin
    opener policy by serving the following headers:
    
    <pre highlight="http">
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
    <strong>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none</strong>
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    </pre>

    For example:

    *   ISSUE: Find some links.

2.  Documents that only wish to be framed in cross-origin contexts could loosen their framing
    protections by serving the following headers:

    <pre highlight="http">
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    <strong>X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL</strong>
    </pre>

    <div class="note">
        Note: That this allows embedding by any cross-origin documents. That's reasonable for some
        widgety use cases, but when possible, a more secure alternative would specify a list of origins
        which are allowed to embed the document via the [=frame-ancestors=] CSP directive. That is, in
        addition to the `X-Frame-Options` header above, the following header could also be included to
        restrict the document to a short list of trusted embedders:

        <pre highlight="http">
        Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://trusted1.example https://trusted2.example
        </pre>
    </div>

    For example:

    *   ISSUE: Find some links.

3.  Documents that support both popup and framing scenarios need to loosen both their cross-origin
    opener policies and framing protections by combining the recommendations above, serving the
    following headers:

    <pre class="lang-http">
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
    <strong>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none</strong>
    Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-User
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    <strong>X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL</strong>
    </pre>

    For example:

    *   ISSUE: Find some links.

Implementation Considerations {#considerations}
===============================================

Explicitly Setting Headers with Default Values {#explicit-defaults}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Several recommendations above suggest that developers would be well-served to set headers like
`X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL` or `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none` on responses. These
map to the web's status quo behavior, and seem therefore superfluous. Why should developers
set them?

The core reason is that these defaults are poor fits for today's threats, and we ought to be working
to change them. Proposals like [[EMBEDDING-REQUIRES-OPT-IN]] and [[COOP-BY-DEFAULT]] suggest that
we shift the web's defaults away from requiring developers to opt-into more secure behaviors by
making them opt-out rather than opt-in. This would place the configuration cost on those developers
whose projects require risky settings.

This document recommends setting those less-secure header values explicitly, as that makes it more
likely that we'll be able to shift the web's defaults in the future.

Isolating Local-Scheme Frames {#local-scheme-frames}
----------------------------------------------------

Note that frames loaded from local schemes will generally inherit policies applied to the document
which created them, and may end up in-process with that document if the stars align unfortunately.
Developers are encouraged to explicitly shift these documents to opaque origins, either by using
`data:` URLs directly, or by applying a <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute to frames created using
`<iframe srcdoc="...">`, `blob:` URLs, and so on.

Likewise, user agents are encouraged to take <{iframe/sandbox}> attributes into account when
allocating processes for framed documents, and to align the process boundary with the origin
boundary whenever possible.
