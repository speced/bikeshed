# Introduction # {#introduction}

The [[WEBRTC-NV-USE-CASES]] document describes several functions that
can only be achieved by access to media (requirements N20-N22),
including, but not limited to:
* Funny Hats
* Machine Learning
* Virtual Reality Gaming

These use cases further require that processing can be done in worker
threads (requirement N23-N24).

This specification gives an interface based on [[WEBCODECS]] and [[STREAMS]] to
provide access to such functionality.

This specification provides access to raw media,
which is the output of a media source such as a camera, microphone, screen capture,
or the decoder part of a codec and the input to the
decoder part of a codec. The processed media can be consumed by any destination
that can take a MediaStreamTrack, including HTML &lt;video&gt; tags,
RTCPeerConnection, canvas or MediaRecorder.

This specification explicitly aims to support the following use cases:
- *Video processing*: This is the "Funny Hats" use case, where the input is a single video track and the output is a transformed video track.
  - *Custom video sink*: In this use case, the purpose is not producing a processed {{MediaStreamTrack}}, but to consume the media in a different way. For example, an application could use [[WEBCODECS]] and [[WEBTRANSPORT]] to create an {{RTCPeerConnection}}-like sink, but using different codec configuration and networking protocols.
  - *Multi-source processing*: In this use case, two or more tracks are combined into one. For example, a presentation containing a live weather map and a camera track with the speaker can be combined to produce a weather report application.

Note: There is no WG consensus on whether or not audio use cases should be supported.

Note: The WG expects that the Streams spec will adopt the solutions outlined in
[the relevant explainer](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/main/streams-for-raw-video-explainer.md), to solve some issues with the current Streams specification.

# Specification # {#specification}

This specification shows the IDL extensions for [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]].
It defines some new objects that inherit the {{MediaStreamTrack}} interface, and
can be constructed from a {{MediaStreamTrack}}.

The API consists of two elements. One is a track sink that is
capable of exposing the unencoded media frames from the track to a ReadableStream.
The other one is the inverse of that: it provides a track source that takes
media frames as input.

<!-- ## Extension operation ## {#operation} -->

## MediaStreamTrackProcessor ## {#track-processor}

A {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} allows the creation of a
{{ReadableStream}} that can expose the media flowing through
a given {{MediaStreamTrack}}. If the {{MediaStreamTrack}} is a video track,
the chunks exposed by the stream will be {{VideoFrame}} objects.

This makes {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} effectively a sink in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#the-model-sources-sinks-constraints-and-settings">
MediaStream model</a>.

A {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} internally contains a circular queue
that allows buffering incoming media frames delivered by the track it
is connected to. This buffering allows the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}
to temporarily hold frames waiting to be read from its associated {{ReadableStream}}.
The application can influence the maximum size of the queue via a parameter
provided in the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} constructor. However, the
maximum size of the queue is decided by the UA and can change dynamically,
but it will not exceed the size requested by the application.
If the application does not provide a maximum size parameter, the UA is free
to decide the maximum size of the queue.

When a new frame arrives to the
{{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}, if the queue has reached its maximum size,
the oldest frame will be removed from the queue, and the new frame will be
added to the queue. This means that for the particular case of a queue
with a maximum size of 1, if there is a queued frame, it will aways be
the most recent one.

The UA is also free to remove any frames from the queue at any time. The UA
may remove frames in order to save resources or to improve performance in
specific situations. In all cases, frames that are not dropped
must be made available to the {{ReadableStream}} in the order in which
they arrive to the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}.

A {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} makes frames available to its
associated {{ReadableStream}} only when a read request has been issued on
the stream. The idea is to avoid the stream's internal buffering, which
does not give the UA enough flexibility to choose the buffering policy.

### Interface definition ### {#track-processor-interface}

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=DedicatedWorker]
interface MediaStreamTrackProcessor {
    constructor(MediaStreamTrackProcessorInit init);
    attribute ReadableStream readable;
};

dictionary MediaStreamTrackProcessorInit {
  required MediaStreamTrack track;
  [EnforceRange] unsigned short maxBufferSize;
};
</pre>

Note: There is WG consensus that the interface should be exposed on DedicatedWorker.
There is no WG consensus on whether or not the interface should not be exposed on Window.


### Internal slots ### {#internal-slots-processor}
<dl>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>`[[track]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>Track whose raw data is to be exposed by the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}.</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>`[[maxBufferSize]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>The maximum number of media frames to be buffered by the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}
as specified by the application. It may have no value if the application does
not provide it. Its minimum valid value is 1.</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>`[[queue]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>A [=queue=] used to buffer media frames not yet read by the application</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>`[[numPendingReads]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>An integer whose value represents the number of read requests issued by the
application that have not yet been handled.
</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>`[[isClosed]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>An boolean whose value indicates if the {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} is closed.
</dd>
</dl>

### Constructor ### {#constructor-processor}
<dfn constructor for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor title="MediaStreamTrackProcessor(init)">
  MediaStreamTrackProcessor(|init|)
</dfn>
1. If |init|.{{MediaStreamTrackProcessorInit/track}} is not a valid {{MediaStreamTrack}},
    throw a {{TypeError}}.
2. Let |processor| be a new {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} object.
3. Assign |init|.{{MediaStreamTrackProcessorInit/track}} to |processor|.`[[track]]`.
4. If |init|.{{MediaStreamTrackProcessorInit/maxBufferSize}} has a integer value greater than or equal to 1, assign it to |processor|.`[[maxBufferSize]]`.
6. Set the `[[queue]]` internal slot of |processor| to an empty [=queue=].
7. Set |processor|.`[[numPendingReads]]` to 0.
8. Set |processor|.`[[isClosed]]` to false.
9. Return |processor|.

### Attributes ### {#attributes-processor}
<dl>
<dt><dfn attribute for=MediaStreamTrackProcessor>readable</dfn></dt>
<dd>Allows reading the frames delivered by the {{MediaStreamTrack}} stored
in the `[[track]]` internal slot. This attribute is created the first time it is invoked
according to the following steps:
1. Initialize [=this=].{{MediaStreamTrackProcessor/readable}} to be a new {{ReadableStream}}.
2. <a dfn for="ReadableStream">Set up</a> [=this=].{{MediaStreamTrackProcessor/readable}} with its [=ReadableStream/set up/pullAlgorithm=] set to [=processorPull=] with [=this=] as parameter, [=ReadableStream/set up/cancelAlgorithm=] set to [=processorCancel=] with [=this=] as parameter, and [=ReadableStream/set up/highWatermark=] set to 0.

The <dfn>processorPull</dfn> algorithm is given a |processor| as input. It is defined by the following steps:
1. Increment the value of the |processor|.`[[numPendingReads]]` by 1.
2. [=Queue a task=] to run the [=maybeReadFrame=] algorithm with |processor| as parameter.
3. Return  [=a promise resolved with=] undefined.

The <dfn>maybeReadFrame</dfn> algorithm is given a |processor| as input. It is defined by the following steps:
1. If |processor|.`[[queue]]` is [=queue/empty=], abort these steps.
2. If |processor|.`[[numPendingReads]]` equals zero, abort these steps.
3. [=queue/Dequeue=] a frame from |processor|.`[[queue]]` and [=ReadableStream/Enqueue=] it in |processor|.{{MediaStreamTrackProcessor/readable}}.
4. Decrement |processor|.`[[numPendingReads]]` by 1.
5. Go to step 1.

The <dfn>processorCancel</dfn> algorithm is given a |processor| as input.
It is defined by running the following steps:
1. Run the [=processorClose=] algorithm with |processor| as parameter.
3. Return  [=a promise resolved with=] undefined.

The <dfn>processorClose</dfn> algorithm is given a |processor| as input.
It is defined by running the following steps:
1. If |processor|.`[[isClosed]]` is true, abort these steps.
2. Disconnect |processor| from |processor|.`[[track]]`. The mechanism to do this is UA specific and the result is that |processor| is no longer a sink of |processor|.`[[track]]`.
3. [$ReadableStreamDefaultControllerClose|Close$] |processor|.{{MediaStreamTrackProcessor/readable}}.[=ReadableStream/[[controller]]=].
4. [=list/Empty=] |processor|.`[[queue]]`.
5. Set |processor|.`[[isClosed]]` to true.

</dd>
</dl>

### Handling interaction with the track ### {#processor-handling-interaction-with-track}
When the `[[track]]` of a {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} |processor| delivers a
frame to |processor|, the UA MUST execute the [=handleNewFrame=] algorithm
with |processor| as parameter.

The <dfn>handleNewFrame</dfn> algorithm is given a |processor| as input.
It is defined by running the following steps:
1. If |processor|.`[[maxBufferSize]]` has a value and |processor|.`[[queue]]` has |processor|.`[[maxBufferSize]]` elements, [=queue/dequeue=] an item from |processor|.`[[queue]]`.
2. [=queue/Enqueue=] the new frame in |processor|.`[[queue]]`.
3. [=Queue a task=] to run the [=maybeReadFrame=] algorithm with |processor| as parameter.

At any time, the UA MAY [=list/remove=] any frame from |processor|.`[[queue]]`.
The UA may decide to remove frames from |processor|.`[[queue]]`, for example,
to prevent resource exhaustion or to improve performance in certain situations.
</dd>

<p class="note">
The application may detect that frames have been dropped by noticing that there
is a gap in the timestamps of the frames.
</p>
</dl>

When the `[[track]]` of a {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} |processor|
[=track|ends=], the [=processorClose=] algorithm must be
executed with |processor| as parameter.


## VideoTrackGenerator ## {#video-track-generator}
A {{VideoTrackGenerator}} allows the creation of a video source for a
{{MediaStreamTrack}} in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#the-model-sources-sinks-constraints-and-settings">
MediaStream model</a> that generates its frames from a Stream of {{VideoFrame}} objects. It has two readonly
attributes: a {{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} {{WritableStream}} and a
{{VideoTrackGenerator/track}} {{MediaStreamTrack}}.

The {{VideoTrackGenerator}} is the underlying sink] of its
{{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} attribute. The {{VideoTrackGenerator/track}} attribute
is the output. Further tracks connected to the same {{VideoTrackGenerator}} can be
created using the {{MediaStreamTrack/clone}} method on the
{{VideoTrackGenerator/track}} attribute.

The {{WritableStream}} accepts {{VideoFrame}} objects.
When a {{VideoFrame}} is written to {{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}},
the frame's `close()` method is automatically invoked, so that its internal
resources are no longer accessible from JavaScript.

Note: There is consensus in the WG that a source capable of generating a MediaStreamTrack of kind "video" should exist.
There is no WG consensus on whether or not a source capable of generating a MediaStreamTrack of kind "audio" should exist.


### Interface definition ### {#video-generator-interface}
<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=DedicatedWorker]
interface VideoTrackGenerator {
  constructor();
  readonly attribute WritableStream writable;
  attribute boolean muted;
  readonly attribute MediaStreamTrack track;
};
</pre>

Note: There is WG consensus that this interface should be exposed on DedicatedWorker.
There is no WG consensus on whether or not it should be exposed on Window.

### Internal slots ### {#internal-slots}
<dl>
<dt><dfn attribute for=VideoTrackGenerator>`[[track]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>The {{MediaStreamTrack}} output of this source</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=VideoTrackGenerator>`[[isMuted]]`</dfn></dt>
<dd>A boolean whose value indicates whether this source and all the
{{MediaStreamTrack}}s it sources, are currently {{MediaStreamTrack/muted}} or not.
</dd>
</dl>

### Constructor ### {#video-generator-constructor}
<dfn constructor for=VideoTrackGenerator title="VideoTrackGenerator(init)">
  VideoTrackGenerator()
</dfn>
1. Let |generator| be a new {{VideoTrackGenerator}} object.
1. Let |track| be a newly [=Create a MediaStreamTrack|created=] {{MediaStreamTrack}} with <var>source</var> set to |generator| and <var>tieSourceToContext</var> set to <code>false</code>.
1. Initialize |generator|.{{VideoTrackGenerator/track}} to |track|.
4. Return |generator|.

### Attributes ### {#video-generator-attributes}
<dl>
<dt><dfn attribute for=VideoTrackGenerator>writable</dfn></dt>
<dd>Allows writing video frames to the {{VideoTrackGenerator}}. When this attribute
is accessed for the first time, it MUST be initialized with the following steps:
1. Initialize [=this=].{{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} to be a new {{WritableStream}}.
2. <a dfn for="WritableStream">Set up</a> [=this=].{{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}}, with its [=WritableStream/set up/writeAlgorithm=] set to [=writeFrame=] with |this| as parameter, with [=WritableStream/set up/closeAlgorithm=] set to [=closeWritable=] with |this| as parameter and [=WritableStream/set up/abortAlgorithm=] set to [=closeWritable=] with |this| as parameter.

The <dfn>writeFrame</dfn> algorithm is given a |generator| and a |frame| as input. It is defined by running the following steps:
1. If |frame| is not a {{VideoFrame}} object, return [=a promise rejected with= a {{TypeError}}.
1. If |generator|.`[[isMuted]]` is false, send the media data backing |frame| to all live tracks sourced from |generator|.
1. Invoke the `close` method of |frame|.
1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] undefined.

<p class="note">
When the media data is sent to a track, the UA may apply processing
(e.g., cropping and downscaling) to ensure that the media data sent
to the track satisfies the track's constraints. Each track may receive a
different version of the media data depending on its constraints.
</p>

The <dfn>closeWritable</dfn> algorithm is given a |generator| as input.
It is defined by running the following steps.
1. For each track `t` sourced from |generator|, [=track|end=] `t`.
2. Return [=a promise resolved with=] undefined.

</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=VideoTrackGenerator>muted</dfn></dt>
<dd>Mutes the {{VideoTrackGenerator}}. The getter steps are to return
[=this=].`[[isMuted]]`. The setter steps, given a value |newValue|, are as follows:
1. If |newValue| is equal to [=this=].`[[isMuted]]`, abort these steps.
1. Set [=this=].`[[isMuted]]` to |newValue|.
1. Unless one has been queued already this run of the event loop, [=queue a task=] to run the following steps:
    1. Let |settledValue| be [=this=].`[[isMuted]]`.
    1. For each live track sourced by [=this=], [=queue a task=] to [=set a track's muted state=] to |settledValue|.

</dd>
<dt><dfn attribute for=VideoTrackGenerator>track</dfn></dt>
<dd>The {{MediaStreamTrack}} output. The getter steps are to return
[=this=].`[[track]]`.
</dd>
</dl>

### Specialization of MediaStreamTrack behavior ### {#video-generator-as-track}
A {{VideoTrackGenerator}} acts as the source for one or more {{MediaStreamTrack}}s.
This section adds clarifications on how a {{MediaStreamTrack}} sourced from a
{{VideoTrackGenerator}} behaves.

#### stop #### {#video-generator-stop}
The {{MediaStreamTrack/stop}} method stops the track. When the last track
sourced from a {{VideoTrackGenerator}} ends, that {{VideoTrackGenerator}}'s
{{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} is [=WritableStream/closing|closed=].


#### Constrainable properties #### {#generator-constrainable-properties}

The following constrainable properties are defined for any {{MediaStreamTrack}}s sourced from
a {{VideoTrackGenerator}}:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Property Name
      </th>
      <th>
        Values
      </th>
      <th>
        Notes
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr id="def-constraint-width">
      <td>
        width
      </td>
      <td>
        {{ConstrainULong}}
      </td>
      <td>
        As a setting, this is the width, in pixels, of the latest
        frame received by the track.
        As a capability, `max` MUST reflect the
        largest width a {{VideoFrame}} may have, and `min`
        MUST reflect the smallest width a {{VideoFrame}} may have.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="def-constraint-height">
      <td>
        height
      </td>
      <td>
        {{ConstrainULong}}
      </td>
      <td>
        As a setting, this is the height, in pixels, of the latest
        frame received by the track.
        As a capability, `max` MUST reflect the largest height
        a {{VideoFrame}} may have, and `min` MUST reflect
        the smallest height a {{VideoFrame}} may have.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="def-constraint-frameRate">
      <td>
        frameRate
      </td>
      <td>
        {{ConstrainDouble}}
      </td>
      <td>
        As a setting, this is an estimate of the frame rate based on frames
        recently received by the track.
        As a capability `min` MUST be zero and
        `max` MUST be the maximum frame rate supported by the system.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="def-constraint-aspect">
      <td>
        aspectRatio
      </td>
      <td>
        {{ConstrainDouble}}
      </td>
      <td>
        As a setting, this is the aspect ratio of the latest frame
        delivered by the track;
        this is the width in pixels divided by height in pixels as a
        double rounded to the tenth decimal place. As a capability,
        `min` MUST be the
        smallest aspect ratio supported by a {{VideoFrame}}, and `max` MUST be
        the largest aspect ratio supported by a {{VideoFrame}}.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="def-constraint-resizeMode">
      <td>
        resizeMode
      </td>
      <td>
        {{ConstrainDOMString}}
      </td>
      <td>
        As a setting, this string should be one of the members of
        {{VideoResizeModeEnum}}. The value "{{VideoResizeModeEnum/none}}"
        means that the frames output by the MediaStreamTrack are unmodified
        versions of the frames written to the
        {{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} backing
        the track, regardless of any constraints.
        The value "{{VideoResizeModeEnum/crop-and-scale}}" means
        that the frames output by the MediaStreamTrack may be cropped and/or
        downscaled versions
        of the source frames, based on the values of the width, height and
        aspectRatio constraints of the track.
        As a capability, the values "{{VideoResizeModeEnum/none}}" and
        "{{VideoResizeModeEnum/crop-and-scale}}" both MUST be present.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The {{MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints}} method applied to a video {{MediaStreamTrack}}
sourced from a {{VideoTrackGenerator}} supports the properties defined above.
It can be used, for example, to resize frames or adjust the frame rate of the track.
Note that these constraints have no effect on the {{VideoFrame}} objects
written to the {{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}} of a {{VideoTrackGenerator}},
just on the output of the track on which the constraints have been applied.
Note also that, since a {{VideoTrackGenerator}} can in principle produce
media data with any setting for the supported constrainable properties,
an {{MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints}} call on a track
backed by a {{VideoTrackGenerator}} will generally not fail with
{{OverconstrainedError}} unless the given constraints
are outside the system-supported range, as reported by
{{MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities}}.

#### Events and attributes #### {#generator-events-attributes}
Events and attributes work the same as for any {{MediaStreamTrack}}.
It is relevant to note that if the {{VideoTrackGenerator/writable}}
stream of a {{VideoTrackGenerator}} is closed, all the live
tracks connected to it are ended and the `ended` event is fired on them.

# Examples # {#examples}
## Video Processing ## {#video-processing}
Consider a face recognition function `detectFace(videoFrame)` that returns a face position
(in some format), and a manipulation function `blurBackground(videoFrame, facePosition)` that
returns a new VideoFrame similar to the given `videoFrame`, but with the
non-face parts blurred. The example also shows the video before and after
effects on video elements.

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
// main.js

const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video:true});
const videoBefore = document.getElementById('video-before');
const videoAfter = document.getElementById('video-after');
videoBefore.srcObject = stream.clone();

const [track] = stream.getVideoTracks();
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage({track}, [track]);

const {data} = await new Promise(r => worker.onmessage);
videoAfter.srcObject = new MediaStream([data.track]);

// worker.js

self.onmessage = async ({data: {track}}) => {
  const source = new VideoTrackGenerator();
  parent.postMessage({track: source.track}, [source.track]);

  const {readable} = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({track});
  const transformer = new TransformStream({
    async transform(frame, controller) {
      const facePosition = await detectFace(frame);
      const newFrame = blurBackground(frame, facePosition);
      frame.close();
      controller.enqueue(newFrame);
    }
  });
  await readable.pipeThrough(transformer).pipeTo(source.writable);
};
</pre>

## Multi-consumer post-processing with constraints ## {#multi-consumer-constraints}
A common use case is to remove the background from live camera video fed into a
video conference, with a live self-view showing the result. It's desirable for
the self-view to have a high frame rate even if the frame rate used for actual
sending may dip lower due to back pressure from bandwidth constraints. This can
be achieved by applying constraints to a track clone, avoiding having to process
twice.

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
// main.js

const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video:true});
const [track] = stream.getVideoTracks();
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage({track}, [track]);

const {data} = await new Promise(r => worker.onmessage);
const selfView = document.getElementById('video-self');
selfView.srcObject = new MediaStream([data.track.clone()]); // 60 fps

await data.track.applyConstraints({width: 320, height: 200, frameRate: 30});
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
pc.addTrack(data.track); // 30 fps

// worker.js

self.onmessage = async ({data: {track}}) => {
  const source = new VideoTrackGenerator();
  parent.postMessage({track: source.track}, [source.track]);

  const {readable} = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({track});
  const transformer = new TransformStream({transform: myRemoveBackgroundFromVideo});
  await readable.pipeThrough(transformer).pipeTo(source.writable);
};
</pre>

## Multi-consumer post-processing with constraints in a worker ## {#multi-consumer-worker}
Being able to show a higher frame-rate self-view is also relevant when sending
video frames over WebTransport in a worker. The same technique above may be used
here, except constraints are applied to a track clone in the worker.

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
// main.js

const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video:true});
const [track] = stream.getVideoTracks();
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage({track}, [track]);

const {data} = await new Promise(r => worker.onmessage);
const selfView = document.getElementById('video-self');
selfView.srcObject = new MediaStream([data.track]); // 60 fps

// worker.js

self.onmessage = async ({data: {track}}) => {
  const source = new VideoTrackGenerator();
  const sendTrack = source.track.clone();
  parent.postMessage({track: source.track}, [source.track]);

  await sendTrack.applyConstraints({width: 320, height: 200, frameRate: 30});

  const wt = new WebTransport("https://webtransport.org:8080/up");

  const {readable} = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({track});
  const transformer = new TransformStream({transform: myRemoveBackgroundFromVideo});
  await readable.pipeThrough(transformer)
    .pipeThrough({writable: source.writable, readable: sendTrack.readable}),
    .pipeThrough(createMyEncodeVideoStream({
      codec: "vp8",
      width: 640,
      height: 480,
      bitrate: 1000000,
    }))
    .pipeThrough(new TransformStream({transform: mySerializer}));
    .pipeTo(wt.createUnidirectionalStream()); // 30 fps
};
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p>The above example avoids using the `tee()` function to serve multiple
consumers, due to its issues with real-time streams.</p>
<p>For brevity, the example also over-simplifies using a WebCodecs wrapper to
encode and send video frames over a single WebTransport stream (incurring
head-of-line blocking).</p>
</div>

# Implementation advice # {#implementation-advice}

This section is informative.

## Use with multiple consumers ## {#multi-consumers}

There are use cases where the programmer may desire that a single stream of frames
is consumed by multiple consumers.

Examples include the case where the result of a background blurring function should
be both displayed in a self-view and encoded using a {{VideoEncoder}}.

For cases where both consumers are consuming unprocessed frames, and synchronization
is not desired, instantianting multiple {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} objects is a robust solution.

For cases where both consumers intend to convert the result of a processing step into a
{{MediaStreamTrack}}
using a {{VideoTrackGenerator}}, for example when feeding a processed stream
to both a &lt;video&gt& tag and an {{RTCPeerConnection}}, attaching the resulting {{MediaStreamTrack}}
to multiple sinks may be the most appropriate mechanism.

For cases where the downstream processing takes frames, not streams, the frames can
be cloned as needed and sent off to the downstream processing; "clone" is a cheap operation.

When the stream is the output of some processing, and both branches need a Stream object
to do further processing, one needs a function that produces two streams from one stream.

However, the standard tee() operation is problematic
in this context:

*   It defeats the backpressure mechanism that guards against excessive queueing
*   It creates multiple links to the same buffers, meaning that the question of which
    consumer gets to destroy() the buffer is a difficult one to address

Therefore, the use of tee() with Streams containing media should only be done when
fully understanding the implications. Instead, custom elements for splitting streams
more appropriate to the use case should be used.

*   If both branches require the ability to dispose of the frames, clone() the frame
    and enqueue distinct copies in both queues. This corresponds to the function
    ReadableStreamTee(stream, cloneForBranch2=true). Then choose one of the
    alternatives below.

*   If one branch requires all frames, and the other branch tolerates dropped frames,
    enqueue buffers in the all-frames-required stream and use the backpressure signal
    from that stream to stop reading from the source. If backpressure signal from the
    other stream indicates room, enqueue the same frame in that queue too.

*   If neither stream tolerates dropped frames, use the combined backpressure signal
    to stop reading from the source. In this case, frames will be processed in
    lockstep if the buffer sizes are both 1.

*   If it is OK for the incoming stream to be stalled only when the underlying
    buffer pool allocated to the process is exhausted, standard tee() may be used.

Note: There are issues filed on the Streams spec where the resolution might affect this section: https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/1157, https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/1156, https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/401, https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/1186

# Security and Privacy considerations # {#security-considerations}

This API defines a {{MediaStreamTrack}} source and a {{MediaStreamTrack}} sink.
The security and privacy of the source ({{VideoTrackGenerator}}) relies
on the same-origin policy. That is, the data {{VideoTrackGenerator}} can
make available in the form of a {{MediaStreamTrack}} must be visible to
the document before a {{VideoFrame}} object can be constructed
and pushed into the {{VideoTrackGenerator}}. Any attempt to create
{{VideoFrame}} objects using cross-origin data will fail.
Therefore, {{VideoTrackGenerator}} does not introduce any new
fingerprinting surface.

The {{MediaStreamTrack}} sink introduced by this API ({{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}})
exposes {{MediaStreamTrack}} the same data that is exposed by other
{{MediaStreamTrack}} sinks such as WebRTC peer connections, and media elements. The security and privacy
of {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} relies on the security and privacy of the
{{MediaStreamTrack}} sources of the tracks to which {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}}
is connected. For example, camera, microphone and screen-capture tracks
rely on explicit use authorization via permission dialogs (see
[[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] and [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]]),
while element capture and {{VideoTrackGenerator}}
rely on the same-origin policy.

A potential issue with {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor}} is resource exhaustion.
For example, a site might hold on to too many open {{VideoFrame}} objects
and deplete a system-wide pool of GPU-memory-backed frames. UAs can
mitigate this risk by limiting the number of pool-backed frames a site can
hold. This can be achieved by reducing the maximum number of buffered frames
and by refusing to deliver more frames to {{MediaStreamTrackProcessor/readable}}
once the budget limit is reached. Accidental exhaustion is also mitigated by
automatic closing of {{VideoFrame}} objects once they
are written to a {{VideoTrackGenerator}}.

# Backwards compatibility with earlier proposals # {#backwards-compatibility}

This section is informative.

Previous proposals for this interface had an API like this:

<div class="example">
<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window,DedicatedWorker]
interface MediaStreamTrackGenerator : MediaStreamTrack {
    constructor(MediaStreamTrackGeneratorInit init);
    attribute WritableStream writable;  // VideoFrame or AudioData
};

dictionary MediaStreamTrackGeneratorInit {
  required DOMString kind;
};
</pre>
</div>
This interface had the generator for the MediaStreamTrack being an instance of
a MediaStreamTrack rather than containing one.

The VideoTrackGenerator can be shimmed on top of MediaStreamTrackGenerator like this:

<pre class="example">

// Not tested, unlikely to work as written!
class VideoTrackGenerator {
  constructor() {
     this.innerGenerator = new MediaStreamTrackGenerator({kind: 'video'});
     this.writable = this.innerGenerator.writable;
     this.track = this.innerGenerator.clone();
  }
  // Missing: shim for setting of the "muted" attribute.
};

</pre>

Further description of the previous proposals, including considerations involving
processing of audio, can be found in earlier versions of this document.

we have finished moving repos about.
