Abstract:
  This specification defines a framework for exposing sensor data
  to the Open Web Platform in a consistent way.
  It does so by defining a blueprint for writing
  specifications of concrete sensors along with an abstract Sensor interface
  that can be extended to accommodate different sensor types.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

Increasingly, sensor data is used in application development to
enable new use cases such as geolocation,
counting steps or head-tracking.
This is especially true on mobile devices where new sensors are added regularly.

Exposing sensor data to the Web
has so far been both slow-paced and ad-hoc.
Few sensors are already exposed to the Web.
When they are, it is often in ways that limit their possible use cases
(for example by exposing abstractions that are too [=high-level=]
and which don't perform well enough).
APIs also vary greatly from one sensor to the next
which increases the cognitive burden of Web application developers
and slows development.

The goal of the Generic Sensor API is to
promote consistency across sensor APIs,
enable advanced use cases thanks to performant [=low-level=] APIs,
and increase the pace at which new sensors can be exposed to the Web
by simplifying the specification and implementation processes.

A comprehensive list of concrete sensors that are based on Generic Sensor API, applicable use
cases, and code examples can be found in [[GENERIC-SENSOR-USECASES]] and [[MOTION-SENSORS]]
explainer documents.

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>.

The scope of this specification is currently limited
to specifying primitives which enable exposing data from [=device sensors=].

Exposing remote sensors
or sensors found on personal area networks (e.g. Bluetooth)
is out of scope.
As work in these areas mature,
it is possible that common, lower-level primitives be found,
in which case this specification will be updated accordingly.
This should have little to no effects on implementations, however.

This specification also does not currently expose a
sensor discovery API.
This is because the limited number of sensors currently available to user agents
does not warrant such an API.
Using feature detection, such as described in [[#feature-detection]],
is good enough for now.
A subsequent version of this specification might specify such an API,
and the current API has been designed with this in mind.


<h2 id="feature-detection">A note on Feature Detection of Hardware Features</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Feature detection is an established Web development best practice.
Resources on the topic are plentiful on and offline and
the purpose of this section is not to discuss it further,
but rather to put it in the context of detecting hardware-dependent features.

Consider the below feature detection examples:

<div class="example">
    This simple example illustrates how to check whether the User Agent
    exposes an interface for a particular sensor type. To handle errors in a robust
    manner, please refer to [this example](#robust-example).
    <pre highlight="js">
        if (typeof Gyroscope === "function") {
            // run in circles...
        }

        if ("ProximitySensor" in window) {
            // watch out!
        }

        if (window.AmbientLightSensor) {
            // go dark...
        }

        // etc.
    </pre>
</div>

All of these tell you something about the presence
and possible characteristics of an API.
They do not tell you anything, however, about whether
that API is actually connected to a real hardware sensor,
whether that sensor works,
if its still connected,
or even whether the user is going to allow you to access it.
Note you can check the latter using the Permissions API [[PERMISSIONS]].

In an ideal world, information about the underlying status
would be available upfront.
The problem with this is twofold.
First, getting this information out of the hardware is costly,
in both performance and battery time,
and would sit in the critical path.
Secondly, the status of the underlying hardware can evolve over time.
The user can revoke permission, the connection to the sensor be severed,
the operating system may decide to limit sensor usage below a certain battery threshold,
etc.

Therefore, an effective strategy is to combine feature detection,
which checks whether an API for the sought-after sensor actually exists,
and defensive programming which includes:

1.  checking for error thrown when instantiating a {{Sensor}} object,
2.  listening to errors emitted by it,
3.  handling all of the above graciously so that the user's experience is
    enhanced by the possible usage of a sensor, not degraded by its
    absence.

<div class="example" id="robust-example">
    The following snippet illustrates how an Accelerometer sensor can be created
    in a robust manner. Web application may choose different options for error
    handling, for example, show notification, choose different sensor type or
    fallback to other API.
    <pre highlight="js">
        let accelerometer = null;
        try {
            accelerometer = new Accelerometer({ frequency: 10 });
            accelerometer.addEventListener('error', event => {
                // Handle runtime errors.
                if (event.error.name === 'NotAllowedError') {
                    console.log('Permission to access sensor was denied.');
                } else if (event.error.name === 'NotReadableError' ) {
                    console.log('Cannot connect to the sensor.');
                }
            });
            accelerometer.addEventListener('reading', () => reloadOnShake(accelerometer));
            accelerometer.start();
        } catch (error) {
            // Handle construction errors.
            if (error.name === 'SecurityError') {
                console.log('Sensor construction was blocked by the Feature Policy.');
            } else if (error.name === 'ReferenceError') {
                console.log('Sensor is not supported by the User Agent.');
            } else {
                throw error;
            }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

<h2 id="security-and-privacy">Security and privacy considerations</h2>

<div class="note">
The judgement on how to communicate to the user the known [[#main-privacy-security-threats|threats]]
is up to the implementer. The implementation of the [[#mitigation-strategies|mitigations]] is
mandatory, however.

The Generic Sensor API and its [=extension specifications=] are agnostic with respect to any user
interface aspects. This specification defines an [[#request-sensor-access|integration point]] to the
Permissions API [[PERMISSIONS]] that implementers can use for [=new information about the user's intent|
explicit or implicit user consenting=]. In addition, implementers are encouraged to use additional
privacy-enhancing mechanisms inline with their product requirements to provide a consistent and
cohesive experience. Such mechanisms can include, for example, global and per-origin access controls,
page info dialogs, location bar indicators, or other disclosure user interface elements.

The Generic Sensor API provides flexibility to implementers to make user consenting and
disclosure user interface design decisions on a concrete sensor basis as needed.
</div>

[=sensor readings|Sensor readings=] are sensitive data and could become a subject of
various attacks from malicious Web pages. Before discussing the mitigation strategies we
briefly enumerate the main types of the [=device sensor|sensor=]'s privacy and security threats.
The [[MOBILESENSORS]] categorizes main threats into [[#location-tracking|location tracking]],
[[#eavesdropping|eavesdropping]], [[#keystroke-monitoring|keystroke monitoring]],
[[#device-fingerprinting|device fingerprinting]], and [[#user-identifying|user identification]].
This categorization is a good fit for this specification.

The risk of successful attack can increase when [=device sensor|sensors=] are used with each other,
in combination with other functionality, or when used over time,
specifically with the risk of correlation of data
and user identification through fingerprinting.
Web application developers using these JavaScript APIs should
consider how this information might be correlated with other information
and the privacy risks that might be created.
The potential risks of collection of such data over a longer period of time
should also be considered.

Variations in [=sensor readings=]
as well as event firing rates
offer the possibility of fingerprinting to identify users.
User agents may reduce the risk by
limiting event rates available to web application developers.

Minimizing the accuracy of a sensor's readout
generally decreases the risk of fingerprinting.
User agents should not provide unnecessarily verbose readouts of sensors data.
Each [=sensor type=] should be assessed individually.

If the same JavaScript code using the API can be
used simultaneously in different window contexts on the same device
it may be possible for that code to correlate the user across those two contexts,
creating unanticipated tracking mechanisms.

User agents should consider providing the user
an indication of when the [=device sensor|sensor=] is used
and allowing the user to disable it.
Additionally, user agents may consider
allowing the user to verify past and current sensor use patterns.

Web application developers that use [=device sensor|sensors=] should
perform a privacy impact assessment of their application
taking all aspects of their application into consideration.

Ability to detect a full working set of sensors on a device can form an
identifier and could be used for fingerprinting.

A combination of selected sensors can potentially be used to form an out of
band communication channel between devices.

Sensors can potentially be used in cross-device linking and tracking of a user.

<h3 id="main-privacy-security-threats">Types of privacy and security threats</h3>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

<h4 id="location-tracking">Location Tracking</h4>

Under this type of threat, the attacks use [=sensor readings=] to locate the device without
using GPS or any other location sensors. For example, accelerometer data can be used to infer
the location of smartphones by using statistical models to obtain estimated trajectory,
then map matching algorithms can be used to obtain predicted location points (within a
200-m radius)[[MOBILESENSORS]].

<h4 id="eavesdropping">Eavesdropping</h4>

Recovering speech from gyroscope [=sensor readings|readings=] is an example of eavesdropping attack.
See [[GYROSPEECHRECOGNITION]].

<h4 id="keystroke-monitoring">Keystroke Monitoring</h4>

Many user inputs can be inferred from [=sensor readings=], this includes a wide range of attacks
on user PINs, passwords, and lock patterns (and even touch actions such as click, scroll, and
zoom) using motion sensors. These attacks normally train a machine learning algorithm to
discover such information about the users. See [[STEALINGPINSVIASENSORS]].

<h4 id="device-fingerprinting">Device Fingerprinting</h4>

Sensors can provide information that can uniquely identify the device using those sensors.
Every concrete sensor model has minor manufacturing imperfections and differences that will be
unique for this model. These manufacturing variations and imperfections can be used to fingerprint
the device [[ACCELPRINT]] [[MOBILESENSORS]].

<h4 id="user-identifying">User Identifying</h4>

[=Sensor readings=] can be used to identify the user, for example via inferring
individual walking patterns from smartphone or wearable device motion sensors' data.


<h3 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h3>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

This section gives a high-level presentation of some of the mitigation strategies
specified in the normative sections of this specification.

<h4 id="secure-context">Secure Context</h4>

[=Sensor readings=] are explicitly flagged by the
Secure Contexts specification [[POWERFUL-FEATURES]]
as a high-value target for network attackers.
Thus all interfaces defined by this specification
or [=extension specifications=]
are only available within a [=secure context=].


<h4 id="feature-policy" oldids="browsing-context">Feature Policy</h4>

To avoid the privacy risk of sharing [=sensor readings=] with contexts unfamiliar
to the user, [=sensor readings=] are only available for the
[=documents=] which are [=allowed to use=] the [=policy-controlled features=] for
the given [=sensor type=]. See [[FEATURE-POLICY]] for more details.

<h4 id="focused-area" oldids="losing-focus">Focused Area</h4>

[=Sensor readings=] are only available for [=active documents=] whose
origin is [=same origin-domain=] with the [=currently focused area=]
document.

This is done in order to mitigate the risk of a skimming attack against the
[=browsing context=] containing an element which has [=gains focus|gained focus=],
for example when the user carries out an in-game purchase using a third party
payment service from within an iframe.

<h4 id="visibility-state">Visibility State</h4>

[=Sensor readings=] are only available for the [=active documents=] whose
[=steps to determine the visibility state|visibility state=]
is "visible".

<h4 id="permissions" oldids="permissioning">Permissions API</h4>

Access to [=sensor readings=] are controlled by the Permissions API [[!PERMISSIONS]].
User agents use a [=new information about the user's intent|number of criteria=]
to grant access to the [=sensor readings|readings=].
Note that access can be granted without prompting the user.

<h3 id="mitigation-strategies-case-by-case">Mitigation strategies applied on a case by case basis</h3>

Each [=sensor type=] will need to be assessed individually,
taking into account the use cases it enables
and its particular threat profile.
While some of the below mitigation strategies
are effective for certain sensors,
they might also hinder or altogether prevent certain use cases.

Note: These mitigation strategies can be applied constantly or temporarily,
for example when the user is carrying out specific actions,
when other APIs which are known to amplify the level of the threat are in use,
etc.


<h4 id="limit-max-frequency" dfn>Limit maximum sampling frequency</h4>

User agents may mitigate certain threats by
limiting the maximum [=sampling frequency=].
What upper limit to choose depends on the [=sensor type=],
the kind of threats the user agent is trying to protect against,
the expected resources of the attacker, etc.

Limiting the maximum [=sampling frequency=] prevents use cases
which rely on low latency or high data density.


<h4 id="stop-sensor" dfn>Stop the sensor altogether</h4>

This is obviously a last-resort solution,
but it can be extremely effective if it's temporal,
for example to prevent password skimming attempts
when the user is entering credentials on a different origin ([[rfc6454]])
or in a different application.


<h4 id="limit-number-of-delivered-readings" dfn>Limit number of delivered readings</h4>

An alternative to [=limit maximum sampling frequency|limiting the maximum sampling frequency=] is to
limit the number of [=sensor readings=] delivered to Web application developer,
regardless of what frequency the sensor is polled at.
This allows use cases which have low latency requirement
to increase [=sampling frequency=]
without increasing the amount of data provided.

Discarding intermediary readings prevents certain use cases,
such as those relying on certain kinds of filters.


<h4 id="reduce-accuracy" dfn>Reduce accuracy</h4>

Reducing the accuracy of [=sensor readings=]
or sensor [=reading timestamps=]
might also help mitigate certain threats,
thus user agents should not provide
unnecessarily verbose readouts of sensors data.

Note: Inaccuracies will further increase for operations carried out on the
[=sensor readings=], or time deltas calculated from the [=reading timestamp|timestamps=].
So, this mitigation strategy can affect certain use cases.

Note: while adding random bias to [=sensor readings=] has similar effects,
it shouldn't be used in practice
as it is easy to filter out the added noise.


<h4 id="inform-user">Keep the user informed about API use</h4>

User agents may choose to keep the user informed
about current and past use of the API.

Note: this does not imply keeping a log of the actual [=sensor readings=]
which would have issues of its own.


<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>


<h3 id="concepts-sensors">Sensors</h3>

The term <dfn id="concept-device-sensor">device sensor</dfn> refers to a device's underlying
physical sensor instance.

A [=device sensor=] measures a physical quantities
and provides a corresponding <dfn>sensor reading</dfn>
which is a source of information about the environment.

Each [=sensor reading=] is composed of the <dfn lt="reading value">values</dfn>
of the physical quantity measured by the [=device sensor=]
at time <var ignore>t<sub>n</sub></var> which is called the <dfn>reading timestamp</dfn>.

If the [=device sensor=] performs a spatial measurement (e.g.
acceleration, angular velocity), it must be resolved in
a <dfn export>local coordinate system</dfn> that represents
a reference frame for the [=device sensor=]'s [=sensor readings=].
A [=device sensor=] that provides such [=sensor readings=]
is referred to as <dfn export>spatial sensor</dfn>.

A [=spatial sensor=] can be <dfn>uniaxial</dfn>, <dfn>biaxial</dfn>,
or <dfn>triaxial</dfn>, depending on the number of orthogonal axes in
which it can perform simultaneous measurements.

Scalar physical quantities (i.e. temperature) do not require
a [=local coordinate system=] for resolution.

The [=local coordinate system=] normally used in a mobile device is
a Cartesian coordinate system, which is defined relative to the
device's screen, so that X and Y axes are parallel to the screen
dimentions and Z axis is perpendicular to the screen surface.

The term <dfn id="concept-platform-sensor">platform sensor</dfn> refers to platform interfaces,
with which the user agent interacts to obtain [=sensor readings=] for a single [=sensor type=]
originated from one or more [=device sensors=].

[=Platform sensor=] can be defined by the underlying platform (e.g. in a native sensors framework)
or by the user agent, if it has a direct access to [=device sensor=].

From the implementation perspective [=platform sensor=] can be treated as a software proxy for the
corresponding [=device sensor=]. It is possible to have multiple [=platform sensors=] simultaneously
interacting with the same [=device sensor=] if the underlying platform suppports it.

In simple cases, a [=platform sensor=] corresponds to a single [=device sensor=],
but if the provided [=sensor readings=] are a product of [=sensor fusion=] performed
in software, the [=platform sensor=] corresponds to a set of [=device sensors=]
involved in the [=sensor fusion=] process.

Discrepancies between a [=sensor reading=]
and the corresponding physical quantity being measured
are corrected through <dfn>calibration</dfn> that can happen at manufacturing time.
Some sensors can require dynamic calibration to compensate unknown discrepancies.

Note: [=platform sensors=] created through [=sensor fusion=] are sometimes
called virtual or synthetic sensors. However, the specification doesn't
make any practical distinction between them.

<h3 id="concepts-sensor-types">Sensor Types</h3>

Different [=sensor types=] measure different physical quantities
such as temperature, air pressure, heart-rate, or luminosity.

For the purpose of this specification we distinguish between
[=high-level=] and [=low-level=] [=sensor types=].

[=Sensor types=] which are characterized by their implementation
are referred to as <dfn>low-level</dfn> sensors.
For example a Gyroscope is a [=low-level=] [=sensor type=].

Sensors named after their [=sensor readings|readings=],
regardless of the implementation,
are said to be <dfn>high-level</dfn> sensors.
For instance, geolocation sensors provide information about the user's location,
but the precise means by which this data is obtained
is purposefully left opaque
(it could come from a GPS chip, network cell triangulation,
wifi networks, etc. or any combination of the above)
and depends on various, implementation-specific heuristics.
[=High-level=] sensors are generally the fruits of
applying algorithms to [=low-level=] sensors--
for example, a pedometer can be built using only the output of a gyroscope--
or of [=sensor fusion=].

That said, the distinction between
[=high-level=] and [=low-level=] [=sensor types=]
is somewhat arbitrary and the line between the two is often blurred.
For instance, a barometer, which measures air pressure,
would be considered [=low-level=] for most common purposes,
even though it is the product of the [=sensor fusion=] of
resistive piezo-electric pressure and temperature sensors.
Exposing the sensors that compose it would serve no practical purpose;
who cares about the temperature of a piezo-electric sensor?
A pressure-altimeter would probably fall in the same category,
while a nondescript altimeter--
which could get its data from either a barometer or a GPS signal--
would clearly be categorized as a [=high-level=] [=sensor type=].

Because the distinction is somewhat blurry,
extensions to this specification (see [[#extensibility]])
are encouraged to provide domain-specific definitions of
[=high-level=] and [=low-level=] sensors
for the given [=sensor types=] they are targeting.

[=Sensor readings=] from different [=sensor types=] can be combined together
through a process called <dfn>sensor fusion</dfn>.
This process provides [=high-level|higher-level=] or
more accurate data (often at the cost of increased latency).
For example, the [=sensor readings|readings=] of a [=triaxial=] magnetometer
needs to be combined with the [=sensor readings|readings=] of an accelerometer
to provide a correct bearing.

<dfn>Smart sensors</dfn> and <dfn>sensor hubs</dfn>
have built-in compute resources which allow them
to carry out [=calibration=] and [=sensor fusion=] at the hardware level,
freeing up CPU resources and lowering battery consumption in the process.

[=Sensor fusion=] can also be carried out in software if it cannot be
performed at the hardware level or if an application-specific
[=sensor fusion|fusion=] algorithm is required.

## Default sensor ## {#concepts-default-sensor}

The Generic Sensor API is designed to make the most common use cases straightforward
while still enabling more complex use cases.

Most of devices deployed today do not carry more than one
[=device sensor=] providing [=sensor readings=] of the same [=sensor type|type=].
The use cases which require a set of similar [=device sensors=] are rare
and generally limited to specific [=sensor types=],
such as multiple accelerometers in 2-in-1 laptops.

The API therefore makes it easy to interact with
the device's default (and often unique) [=device sensor|sensor=]
for each [=sensor types|type=]
simply by instantiating the corresponding {{Sensor}} subclass.

Indeed, without specific information identifying a particular [=device sensor|sensor=]
of a given [=sensor type|type=], the <dfn export>default sensor</dfn> is chosen by the
user agent.

If the underlying platform provides an interface to find the [=default sensor=],
the user agent must choose the sensor offered by the platform, otherwise the user agent
itself defines which of the [=device sensor|sensors=] present on the device is
the [=default sensor=].

<div class="example">
    Listening to the default accelerometer changes:

    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new Accelerometer({ frequency: 30 });

    sensor.onreading = () => { ... }
    sensor.start();
    </pre>
</div>

Note: extension to this specification may choose not to define a [=default sensor=]
when doing so wouldn't make sense.
For example, it does not make sense to explicitly define a default
[=device sensor|sensor=] for geolocation [=sensor type=] as the
implementation of its interface can use multiple backends.

In cases where
multiple [=device sensors=] corresponding to the same [=sensor type|type=]
may coexist on the same device,
specification extension will have to
define ways to uniquely identify each one.

<div class="example">
    For example checking the pressure of the left rear tire:

    <pre highlight="js">
    var sensor = new DirectTirePressureSensor({ position: "rear", side: "left" });
    sensor.onreading = _ => console.log(sensor.pressure);
    sensor.start();
    </pre>
</div>

## Reading change threshold ## {#concepts-reading-change-threshold}

A [=platform sensor=] reports [=sensor readings|readings=] to the user agent considering
the [=reading change threshold=].

The <dfn>reading change threshold</dfn> refers to a value which indicates whether or
not the changes in the [=device sensor=]'s measurements were significant enough to
update the corresponding [=sensor readings=].

The [=reading change threshold|threshold=] value depends on the surrounding software and hardware
environment constraints, e.g., software power consumption optimizations or the underlying
[=device sensor=]'s accuracy.

## Sampling Frequency and Reporting Frequency ## {#concepts-sampling-and-reporting-frequencies}

For the purpose of this specification, <dfn>sampling frequency</dfn> for a [=platform sensor=] is
defined as a frequency at which the user agent obtains [=sensor readings=] from the underlying
platform.

The user agent can request the underlying platform to deliver [=sensor readings|readings=] at a certain
rate which is called <dfn>requested sampling frequency</dfn>.

The [=sampling frequency=] is equal to the [=requested sampling frequency=] if the underlying platform
can support it.

The [=sampling frequency=] differs from the [=requested sampling frequency=] in the following cases:
 - the [=requested sampling frequency=] exceeds upper or lower [=sampling frequency=] bounds
   supported by the underlying platform.
 - the [=reading change threshold|threshold=] value is significant so that some of the
   [=device sensor=]'s measurements are skipped and the [=sensor readings=] are not updated.

The <dfn>reporting frequency</dfn> for a concrete {{Sensor}} object is defined as a frequency at which
the "reading" event is [=fire an event|fired=] at this object.

A {{Sensor}} object cannot access new [=sensor readings|readings=] at a higher rate than the
user agent obtains them from the underlying platform, therefore the [=reporting frequency=] can
never exceed the [=sampling frequency=] for the given [=sensor type=].

## Conditions to expose sensor readings ## {#concepts-can-expose-sensor-readings}

The user agent must verify that all [=mandatory conditions=] are satisfied to ensure it
<dfn>can expose sensor readings</dfn> to the {{Sensor}} objects of a certain
[=sensor type|type=] that belong to a certain [=active document=].

The <dfn>mandatory conditions</dfn> are the following:
 - The given document is a [=responsible document=] of a [=secure context=].
 - For each [=permission name=] from the [=sensor type=]'s associated
   [=sensor permission names=] [=ordered set|set=], the corresponding permission's
   [=permission state|state=] is "granted".
 - [=document visibility state|Visibility state=] of the document is "visible".
 - The document is [=allowed to use=] all the [=policy-controlled features=] associated
   with the given [=sensor type=].
 - [=Currently focused area=] belongs to a document whose origin is [=same origin-domain=]
   with the origin of the given [=active document=].
 - <dfn>Specific conditions</dfn>: The [=extension specifications=] that add new
   [=mandatory conditions|conditions=] hook into this specification at this point.

Note: In order to release hardware resources, the user agent can request underlying
[=platform sensor=] to suspend notifications about newly available readings until it
[=can expose sensor readings=].

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

<h3 id="model-sensor-type">Sensor Type</h3>

A <dfn>sensor type</dfn> has one or more associated
[=extension sensor interface|extension sensor interfaces=].

A [=sensor type=] has a [=ordered set|set=] of <dfn export>associated sensors</dfn>.

A [=sensor type=] may have a [=default sensor=].

A [=sensor type=] has a [=set/is empty|nonempty=] [=ordered set|set=] of associated
[=permission names=] referred to as <dfn export>sensor permission names</dfn>.

Note: multiple [=sensor types=] may share the same [=permission name=].

A [=sensor type=] has a [=permission revocation algorithm=].

<div algorithm>

    To invoke the <dfn lt="generic sensor permission revocation algorithm">permission revocation algorithm</dfn>
    with {{PermissionName}} |permission_name|, run the following steps:

    1.  For each |sensor_type| whose [=sensor permission names|permission names=] [=set/contains=] |permission_name|:
        1.  [=set/For each=] |sensor| in |sensor_type|'s [=ordered set|set=] of [=associated sensors=],
            1.  Invoke [=revoke sensor permission=] with |sensor| as argument.
</div>

A [=sensor type=] has a [=set/is empty|nonempty=] [=ordered set|set=] of associated
[=policy-controlled feature=] tokens referred to as <dfn export>sensor feature names</dfn>.

<h3 id="model-sensor">Sensor</h3>

The current [=browsing context=]'s [=platform sensor=] has an associated [=ordered set|set=]
of <dfn>activated sensor objects</dfn>, which is initially [=set/is empty|empty=] and an
associated <dfn>latest reading</dfn> [=ordered map|map=], which holds the latest available [=sensor readings=].

Note: User agents can share the [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=] and
the [=activated sensor objects=] [=ordered set|set=] between different
[=browsing context|contexts=] only if the [=origins=] of these contexts' [=active documents=]
are [=same origin-domain=].

Any time a new [=sensor reading=] for a [=platform sensor=] is obtained and if the user agent
[=can expose sensor readings=] to the current [=browsing context=]'s [=active document=],
the user agent invokes [=update latest reading=] with the [=platform sensor=] and
the [=sensor reading=] as arguments.

The [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=] contains an [=map/entry=] whose [=map/key=] is
"timestamp" and whose [=map/value=] is a high resolution timestamp that estimates the
[=reading timestamp=] expressed in milliseconds since the [=time origin=].

Note: The accuracy of the [=reading timestamp=] estimate depends on the underlying
platform interfaces that expose it.

The [=latest reading=]["timestamp"] is initially set to null,
unless the [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=] caches a previous [=sensor readings|reading=].

The other [=map/entries=] of the [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=]
hold the values of the different quantities measured by the [=platform sensor=].
The [=map/keys=] of these [=map/entries=] must match
the [=attribute=] [=identifier=] defined by the [=sensor type=]'s
associated [=extension sensor interface=].
The return value of the [=attribute=] getter is
easily obtained by invoking [=get value from latest reading=]
with the object implementing the [=extension sensor interface=]
and the [=attribute=] [=identifier=] as arguments.

The [=map/value=] of all [=latest reading=] [=map/entries=]
is initially set to null.
<!-- ,
unless the [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=]
caches a previous [=sensor readings|reading=].

Note: there are additional privacy concerns when using cached [=sensor readings|readings=]
which predate either [=navigating=] to resources in the current [=origin=],
or being granted permission to access the [=platform sensor=]. -->

A [=platform sensor=] has an associated [=requested sampling frequency=] which is initially null.

For a non[=set/is empty|empty=] [=ordered set|set=] of [=activated sensor objects=] the
[=requested sampling frequency=] is equal to <dfn>optimal sampling frequency</dfn>, which is estimated
by the user agent taking into account {{[[frequency]]|provided frequencies}}
of [=activated sensor objects|activated=] {{Sensor|Sensors}} and [=sampling frequency=] bounds
defined by the underlying platform.

Note: For example, the user agent may estimate [=optimal sampling frequency=] as a Least Common
Denominator (LCD) for a set of {{[[frequency]]|provided frequencies}} capped
by [=sampling frequency=] bounds defined by the underlying platform.

<div class=example>

This example illustrates a possible implementation of the described [[#model|Model]].

In the diagram below several [=activated sensor objects|activated=] {{Sensor}} objects from two
different [=browsing contexts=] interact with a single [=device sensor=].

<img srcset="images/generic_sensor_model.svg" src="images/generic_sensor_model.png" alt="Generic Sensor Model">

The {{Sensor}} object in "idle" [[#sensor-lifecycle|state]] is not among the [=platform sensor=]'s
[=activated sensor objects=] and thus it does not interact with the [=device sensor=].

In this example there is a [=platform sensor=] instance per [=browsing context=].

The [=latest reading=] [=ordered map|map=] is shared between {{Sensor}} objects from the
same [=browsing context|context=] and is updated at rate equal to [=requested sampling frequency=]
of the corresponding [=platform sensor=].

Note: the nodes in the diagram above represent the states of a {{Sensor}} object and they should not be
confused with the possible states of the underlying [=platform sensor=] or [=device sensor=].

### Sensor garbage collection ### {#sensor-garbage-collection}

A {{Sensor}} object whose {{[[state]]}} is "activating" must not be garbage collected
if there are any event listeners registered for "activated" events, "reading" events,
or "error" events.

A {{Sensor}} object whose {{[[state]]}} is "activated" must not be garbage collected
if there are any event listeners registered for "reading" events, or "error" events.

When a {{Sensor}} object whose {{[[state]]}} is "activated" or "activating" is
garbage collected, the user agent must invoke [=deactivate a sensor object=]
with this object as argument.

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

The Generic Sensor API and its [=extension specifications=] pose a challenge
to test authors, as fully exercising those interfaces requires physical hardware
devices that respond in predictable ways. To address this challenge this document
defines a number of [=extension commands=] to the [[WebDriver]] specification
for controlling [=mock sensor=] on the host that the user agent is running on.
With these [=extension commands=], devices with particular properties can be created
and their responses to requests are well defined.

<h3 id="mock-sensors">Mock Sensors</h3>

A <dfn>mock sensor</dfn> simulates the behavior of a [=platform sensor=] in controlled ways.

A [=mock sensor=] reports a corresponding <dfn id="mock-sensor-reading">mock [=sensor reading=]</dfn>, which is a source of
mocking information about the environment, to the {{Sensor}} objects.

The [=current browsing context=]'s [=mock sensor=] has an associated [=mock sensor reading=] [=ordered map|map=].

The [=mock sensor reading=] [=ordered map|map=] contains an [=map/entry=] whose [=map/key=] is
"timestamp" and whose [=map/value=] is a high resolution timestamp that estimates the time [=mock sensor reading=]
sent to observers of the {{Sensor}} object, expressed in milliseconds since the [=time origin=].

The other [=map/entries=] of the [=mock sensor reading=] [=ordered map|map=] whose [=map/keys=] must match the
[=dictionary members=] [=identifier=] defined by the [=mock sensor type=]'s {{MockSensorReadingValues}}
and whose initial [=map/values=] are implementation-dependent.

Note: The user agent must provide the [=mock sensor reading=] that are initially exposed to the {{Sensor}} objects.

A [=mock sensor=] has an associated [=requested sampling frequency=]. Its default value is implementation-dependent
but must be set within a [=mock sensor=]'s associated [=sampling frequency=] bounds.

A [=mock sensor=] has an associated [=sampling frequency=] with supported bounds. The default values of
supported bounds are implementation-dependent.

A [=mock sensor=] must report the [=mock sensor reading=] at the rate of its [=requested sampling frequency=]
if the user agent [=can expose sensor readings=] to the [=current browsing context=]'s [=active document=].

Note: The [=mock sensor=] defined in this specification is not intended be used by non-testing-related web content.
The UA MAY choose to expose [=mock sensor=] interface only when a runtime or compile-time flag has been set.

The {{MockSensor}} dictionary provides information about a [=mock sensor=].

: {{MockSensor/maxSamplingFrequency}} member
:: A double representing frequency in Hz that indicates the maximum supported [=sampling frequency=] of the associated [=mock sensor=].

: {{MockSensor/minSamplingFrequency}} member

: {{MockSensor/requestedSamplingFrequency}} member
:: A double representing frequency in Hz that indicates the [=requested sampling frequency=] of the associated [=mock sensor=].

A <dfn>serialized mock sensor</dfn> is a JSON [=Object=] where a [=mock sensor=]'s fields listed in the {{MockSensor}} dictionary are mapped
using the <i>JSON Key</i> and the associated field's value from the available [=mock sensor=] in [=current browsing context=].

### Mock sensor type ### {#section-mock-sensor-type}

A <dfn>mock sensor type</dfn> is equivalent to a [=sensor type=]'s associated {{Sensor}} subclass.

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Note: This section and its subsections provide guidance to [=extension specification=]
<em>authors</em> using normative language. From <em>implementers'</em> point of view,
this section and its subsections are considered non-normative.

This section describes how this specification can be extended to specify APIs for different
[=sensor types=].

Such <dfn lt="extension specification">extension specifications</dfn> are encouraged to focus on a
single [=sensor type=], exposing both [=high-level|high=] and [=low-level|low=] level
as appropriate.

[=Extension specifications=] are encouraged to define whether a [=calibration=]
process applies to [=sensor readings=].

[=Extension specifications=]
may explicitly define the [=local coordinate system=] for the associated
[=sensor type=] or make it configurable per {{Sensor}} object.

For an up-to-date list of [=extension specifications=], please refer to [[GENERIC-SENSOR-USECASES]]
and [[MOTION-SENSORS]] documents.

<h3 id="extension-security-and-privacy">Security and Privacy</h3>

[=Extension specifications=] are expected to:

- conform with the generic [[#mitigation-strategies|mitigation strategies]],
- consider [[#mitigation-strategies-case-by-case|mitigation strategies applied
  on a case by case basis]],
- be evaluated against the Self-Review Questionnaire on Security and Privacy
  [[SECURITY-PRIVACY-QUESTIONNAIRE]],
- and in particular, be evaluated against the
  <a class="non-normative">same-origin policy violations</a>
  that can arise if sensors expose a new communication channel not governed
  by the same-origin policy.

<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>

{{Sensor}} interfaces for [=low-level=] sensors should be
named after their associated [=platform sensor=].
So for example, the interface associated with a gyroscope
should be simply named `Gyroscope`.
{{Sensor}} interfaces for [=high-level=] sensors should be
named by combining the physical quantity the [=platform sensor=] measures
with the "Sensor" suffix.
For example, a [=platform sensor=] measuring
the distance at which an object is from it
may see its associated interface called `ProximitySensor`.

Attributes of the {{Sensor}} subclass that
hold [=sensor readings=] values
should be named after the full name of these values.
For example, the `Thermometer` interface should hold
the [=sensor reading=]'s value in
a `temperature` attribute (and not a `value` or `temp` attribute).
A good starting point for naming are the
Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies [[QUDT]].


<h3 id="unit">Unit</h3>

[=Extension specifications=] must specify the unit of [=sensor readings=].

As per the Technical Architecture Group's (TAG) API Design Principles [[API-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]],
all time measurement should be in milliseconds.
All other units should be specified using,
in order of preference,
and with the exception of temperature (for which Celsius should be favored over Kelvin),
the International System of Units (SI),
SI derived units, and
Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI,
as described in the SI Brochure [[SI]].


<h3 id="high-vs-low-level">Exposing High-Level vs. Low-Level Sensors</h3>

So far, specifications exposing sensors to the Web platform
have focused on [=high-level=] sensors APIs. [[GEOLOCATION-API]] [[ORIENTATION-EVENT]]

This was a reasonable approach for a number of reasons.
Indeed, [=high-level=] sensors:

-   convey developer intent clearly,
-   do not require intimate knowledge of how the underlying hardware sensors functions,
-   are easy to use,
-   may enable the User Agent to make significant
    performance and battery life improvements,
-   help avoid certain privacy and security issues by
    decreasing the amount and type of information exposed.

However, an increasing number of use cases
such as virtual and augmented reality
require [=low-level=] access to sensors,
most notably for performance reasons.

Providing [=low-level=] access
enables Web application developers to leverage domain-specific constraints
and design more performant systems.

Following the precepts of the Extensible Web Manifesto [[EXTENNNNSIBLE]],
[=extension specifications=] should focus primarily on
exposing [=low-level=] sensor APIs, but should also expose
[=high-level=] APIs when they are clear benefits in doing so.


<h3 id="multiple-sensors">When is Enabling Multiple Sensors of the Same Type Not the Right Choice?</h3>

It is not advisable to construct multiple {{Sensor}} instances of the same [=sensor type=] with
equal construction parameters, as it can lead to unnecessary hardware resources consumption.

In cases when multiple observers are interested in notifications of a newly available
[=sensor reading=], an [=event listener=] can be added on a single {{Sensor}} instance instead of
creating multiple instances of the same [=sensor type=] and using simple {{Sensor/onreading}} event
handler.

Conversely, multiple {{Sensor|Sensors}} of the same [=sensor type=] can be created when they
are intended to be used with different settings, such as: [=requested sampling frequency=],
accuracy or other settings defined in [=extension specifications=].

<h3 id="definition-reqs">Definition Requirements</h3>

The following definitions must be specified for
each [=sensor type=] in [=extension specifications=]:

-   An <dfn export>extension sensor interface</dfn>, which is an [=interface=]
    whose [=inherited interfaces=] contains {{Sensor}}.
    The [=extension sensor interface=] must be constructible.
    Its [{{Constructor!!extended-attribute}}] must take, as an argument,
    an optional [=dictionary=] whose [=inherited dictionaries=] contains {{SensorOptions}}.

    The [=extension sensor interface=] has a [=ordered set|set=] of supported options
    referred to as <dfn export>supported sensor options</dfn>.
    Unless the [=extension specification=] defines otherwise,
    [=supported sensor options=] [=set/contain=] a single item which is "frequency".

    The user agent must remove items from [=supported sensor options=] for a given
    [=extension sensor interface=] if it cannot support the corresponding sensor
    options.

    The [=extension sensor interface=] [=attributes=] which expose [=sensor readings=] are
    [=read only=] and their getters must return the result of invoking
    [=get value from latest reading=] with <strong>this</strong> and
    [=attribute=] [=identifier=] as arguments.

-   A [=permission name=], if the [=sensor type=] is not representing
    [=sensor fusion=] (otherwise, [=permission names=]
    associated with the fusion source [=sensor types=] must be used).

An [=extension specification=] may specify the following definitions
for each [=sensor types=]:

-   A [=dictionary=] whose [=inherited dictionaries=] contains {{SensorOptions}}.
-   A [=default sensor=]. Generally, devices are equipped with a single [=platform sensor=]
    of each [=sensor types|type=],
    so defining a [=default sensor=] should be straightforward.
    For [=sensor types=] where multiple [=device sensor|sensors=] are common,
    [=extension specifications=] may choose not to define a [=default sensor=],
    especially when doing so would not make sense.

<h3 id="extend-automation">Automation</h3>

In order to enable user-agent automation and application testing,
[=extension specifications=] are encouraged to:

- Add new [=mock sensor type=] for each [=extension sensor interface=]
  to the {{MockSensorType}} enum.
- Define a [=mock sensor reading values=] dictionary.


<h3 id="permission-api">Extending the Permission API</h3>

An implementation of the {{Sensor}} interface for each [=sensor type=] must protect its
[=sensor reading|reading=] by associated [=permission name=] or {{PermissionDescriptor}}.
A [=Low-level=] {{Sensor|sensor}} may use its interface name as a [=permission name=],
for instance, "gyroscope" or "accelerometer". [=sensor fusion|Fusion sensors=] must
[=request permission to use|request permission to access=] each of the sensors that are
used as a source of fusion.

Even though it might be difficult to reconstruct [=low-level=] [=sensor readings=] from
fused data, some of the original information might be inferred. For example, it is easy to
deduce user's orientation in space if absolute or geomagnetic orientation sensors are used,
therefore, these sensors must [=request permission to use|request permission to use=]
magnetometer as it provides information about orientation of device in relation to Earth's
magnetic field. In contrast, relative orientation sensor does not expose such information, thus,
it does not need to [=request permission to use|request permission to use=] magnetometer.

{{PermissionDescriptor|Permission descriptors}} can also be used to set maximum allowed limits
for accuracy or [=sampling frequency=]. An example for a possible extension of the Permission API
for accelerometer sensor is given below.

<pre class=example>
    dictionary AccelerometerPermissionDescriptor : PermissionDescriptor {
        boolean highAccuracy = false;
        boolean highFrequency = false;
    };
</pre>

<h3 id="feature-policy-api">Extending the Feature Policy API</h3>

An implementation of the {{Sensor}} interface for each [=sensor type=] has one
(if [=sensor fusion=] is not performed) or several [=policy-controlled features=]
that control whether or not this implementation can be used in a document.

The [=policy-controlled feature|features=]' [=default allowlist=] is
<code>["self"]</code>.

Note: The [=default allowlist=] of <code>["self"]</code> allows {{Sensor}} interface
implementation usage in same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party content
from [=sensor readings=] access.

The [=sensor feature names=] [=ordered set|set=] must contain [=policy-controlled feature=]
tokens of every associated [=policy-controlled feature|feature=].

A [=Low-level=] {{Sensor|sensor}} may use its interface name as a [=policy-controlled feature=] token,
for instance, "gyroscope" or "accelerometer". Unless the [=extension specification=] defines
otherwise, the [=sensor feature names=] matches the same [=sensor type|type=]-associated
[=sensor permission names=].

<div class="example html">
The accelerometer feature is selectively enabled for third-party origin by adding
[=allow attribute=] to the frame container element:
<pre highlight="html">
  &lt;iframe src="https://third-party.com" allow="accelerometer"/&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example html">
A sensor usage is disabled completely by specifying the feature policy in a HTTP
response header:
<pre highlight="js">

that are used as a source of fusion.

for proximity [=device sensor|sensors=].

    interface ProximitySensor : Sensor {

<h2 id="conformance" class="no-ref no-num">Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions" class="no-ref no-num">Document conventions</h3>

    <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
    descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
    However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
    letters in this specification.

    <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
    explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

    <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words "for example"
    or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
    like this:

    <div class="example">
        <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Because this document doesn't itself define APIs for specific [=sensor types=]--
    that is the role of extensions to this specification--
    all examples are inevitably (wishful) fabrications.
    Although all of the [=device sensor|sensors=] used a examples
    would be great candidates for building atop the Generic Sensor API,
    their inclusion in this document does not imply that the relevant Working Groups
    are planning to do so.

    <p>Informative notes begin with the word "Note" and are set apart from the
    normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

    <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformant-algorithms" class="no-ref no-num">Conformant Algorithms</h3>

    <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
    "strip any leading space characters" or "return false")
    are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must",
    "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is <dfn>equivalent</dfn>. In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
    be easy to understand and are not intended to be performant. Implementers
    are encouraged to optimize.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes" class="no-ref no-num">Conformance Classes</h3>

    <p>A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> must implement all the requirements
    listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.</p>
