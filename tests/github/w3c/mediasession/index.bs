<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Media is used extensively today, and the Web is one of the primary means of
consuming media content. Many platforms can display media metadata, such as
title, artist, album and album art on various UI elements such as notification,
media control center, device lockscreen and wearable devices. This specification
aims to enable web pages to specify the media metadata to be displayed in
platform UI, and respond to media controls which may come from platform UI or
media keys, thereby improving the user experience.

<h2 id="conformance">Conformance</h2>

All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as
are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this
specification is normative.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. For readability, these
words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. [[!RFC2119]]

Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any
leading space characters" or "return false and terminate these steps") are to be
interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used
in introducing the algorithm.

Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy
to follow, and not intended to be performant.)

User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained
inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out
of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.

When a method or an attribute is said to call another method or attribute, the
user agent must invoke its internal API for that attribute or method so that
e.g. the author can't change the behavior by overriding attributes or methods
with custom properties or functions in JavaScript.

Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons use [=is|is identical to=].

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for
conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

<section>
  <h2 id='security-privacy-considerations'>Security and Privacy
  Considerations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <p>
    The API introduced in this specification has very low impact with regards to
    security and privacy. Part of the API allows a website to expose metadata
    that can be used by the user agent. The user agent obviously needs to use
    this data with care. Another part of the API allows a website to receive
    commands from the user via buttons or other form of controls which might
    sometimes introduce a new input layer between the user and the website.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3 id='user-interface-guidelines'>User interface guidelines</h3>

    <p>
      The {{MediaMetadata}} introduced in this specification allows a website to
      offer more information with regards to what is being played. The user
      agent is meant to use this information in any UI related to media
      playback, either internal to the user agent or within the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The {{MediaMetadata}} are expected to be used in the context of media
      playback, making spoofing harder but because the {{MediaMetadata}} has
      text fields and image fields, a malicious website could try to spoof
      another website's identity. It is recommended that the user agent offers a
      way to find the origin or clearly expose the origin of the website which
      the metadata are coming from.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a user agent offers a mechanism to go back to a website from a UI
      element created based on the {{MediaMetadata}}, it is recommended that the
      action should not be noticeable by the website, thus reducing the chances
      of spoofing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, all security and privacy considerations related to the display
      of notifications from a website should apply here. It is worth noting that
      the {{MediaMetadata}} offer less customization than regular web
      notifications, thus would be harder to spoof.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id='incognito-mode-privacy'>Incognito mode</h3>

    <p>
      For privacy purposes, when in incognito mode, the user agent should be
      careful when sharing the information from {{MediaMetadata}} with the
      system and make sure they will not be used in a way that would harm the
      user. Displaying this information in a way that is very visible would be
      against the user's intent of browsing in incognito mode. When available,
      the UI elements should be advertized as private to the platform.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id='media-session-actions-privacy'>Media Session Actions</h3>

    <p>
      <a>Media session actions</a> expose a new input layer to the web platform.
      User agents should make sure users are aware that their actions might be
      routed to the website with the <a>active media session</a>. Especially,
      when the actions are coming from remote devices such as a headset or other
      remote device. It is recommended for the user agent to follow the platform
      conventions when listening to these inputs in order to facilitate the user
      understanding.
    </p>

  <h2 id='model'>Model</h2>

  <section>
    <h3 id='playback-state-model'>Playback State</h3>

    <p>
      In order to make <a enum-value for="MediaSessionAction">play</a> and
      <a enum-value for="MediaSessionAction">pause</a> actions work properly,
      the user agent SHOULD be able to determine if a <a>browsing context</a> of
      the <a>active media session</a> is playing media or not, which is called
      the <dfn>guessed playback state</dfn>. The RECOMMENDED way for determining
      the <a>guessed playback state</a> is to monitor the media elements whose
      node document's browsing context is the <a>browsing context</a>. The
      <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>guessed playback state</a> is <a enum-value
      for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</a> if any of them is
      <a>potentially playing</a> and not <a>muted</a>, and is <a enum-value
      for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">paused</a> otherwise. Other information
      SHOULD also be considered, such as WebAudio and plugins.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a attribute for="MediaSession">playbackState</a> attribute specifies
      the <a>declared playback state</a> from the <a>browsing context</a>. The
      state is combined with the <a>guessed playback state</a> to compute the
      <dfn>actual playback state</dfn>, which is a finalized state and will be
      used for
      <a enum-value for="MediaSessionAction">play</a> and
      <a enum-value for="MediaSessionAction">pause</a> actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a>actual playback state</a> is computed in the following way:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the <a>declared playback state</a> is <a enum-value
          for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</a>, return <a enum-value
          for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, return the <a>guessed playback state</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class=note>
      The {{MediaSession/playbackState}} attribute could be useful when the page
      wants to do some preparation steps when the media is paused but it allows
      the preparation steps to be interrupted by <a enum-value
      for="MediaSessionAction">pause</a> action. See <a
      href="#example-set-playbackState">Setting playbackState</a> for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the <a>actual playback state</a> of the <a>active media session</a>
      changes, the user agent MUST run the <a>media session actions update
      algorithm</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="media-session-routing">Routing</h3>

    There could be multiple {{MediaSession}} objects existing at the same time
    since the user agent could have multiple tabs, each tab could contain a
    <a>top-level browsing context</a> and multiple <a>nested browsing
    contexts</a>, and each <a>browsing context</a> could have a {{MediaSession}}
    object.

    The user agent MUST select at most one of the {{MediaSession}} objects to
    present to the user, which is called the <dfn>active media session</dfn>.
    The <a>active media session</a> may be null. The selection is up to the user
    agent and SHOULD be based on preferred user experience. Note that the
    {{MediaSession/playbackState}} attribute MUST not affect media session
    routing. It only takes effect for the <a>active media session</a>.

    It is RECOMMENDED that the user agent selects the <a>active media
    session</a> by managing <a>audio focus</a>. A tab or <a>browsing context</a>
    is said to have <dfn>audio focus</dfn> if it is currently playing audio or
    the user expects to control the media in it. The AudioFocus API targets this
    area and could be used once it's finished.

    Whenever the <a>active media session</a> is changed, the user agent MUST run
    the <a>media session actions update algorithm</a> and the <a>update metadata
    algorithm</a>.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id='metadata'>Metadata</h3>

    The media metadata for the <a>active media session</a> MAY be displayed in
    the platform UI depending on platform conventions. Whenever the <a>active
    media session</a> changes or setting <a attribute
    for="MediaSession"><code>metadata</code></a> of the <a>active media
    session</a>, the user agent MUST run the <dfn>update metadata
    algorithm</dfn>. The steps are as follows:

    <ol>
      <li>
        If the <a>active media session</a> is null, unset the media metadata
        presented to the platform, and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the <a attribute for="MediaSession"><code>metadata</code></a> of the
        <a>active media session</a> is an <a>empty metadata</a>, unset the media
        metadata presented to the platform, and terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Update the media metadata presented to the platform to match the <a
        attribute for="MediaSession"><code>metadata</code></a> for the
        <a>active media session</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user agent wants to display an <a>artwork image</a>, it is
        RECOMMENDED to run the <a>fetch image algorithm</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    The RECOMMENDED <dfn>fetch image algorithm</dfn> is as follows:

    <ol>
      <!-- XXX https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24055 -->
      <li>
        If there are other <a>fetch image algorithms</a> running, cancel
        existing algorithm execution instances.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>metadata</var>'s <a attribute
        for="MediaMetadata"><code>artwork</code></a> of the <a>active media
        session</a> is empty, then terminate these steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the platform supports displaying media artwork, select a
        <dfn>preferred artwork image</dfn> from <var>metadata</var>'s <a
        attribute for="MediaMetadata"><code>artwork</code></a> of the <a>active
        media session</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a title="fetch">Fetch</a> the <a>preferred artwork image</a>'s
        {{MediaImage/src}}.

        Then, <a>in parallel</a>:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Wait for the <a>response</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the <a>response</a>'s <a>internal response</a>'s <a lt="response
            type">type</a> is <i>default</i>, attempt to decode the resource as
            an image.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the image format is supported, use the image as the artwork for
            display in platform UI. Otherwise the <a>fetch image algorithm</a>
            fails and terminates.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    If no images are fetched in the <a>fetch image algorithm</a>, the user agent
    MAY have fallback behavior such as displaying a default image as artwork.

  <section>
    <h3 id="actions-model">Actions</h3>

    <p>
      A <dfn>media session action</dfn> is an action that the page can handle in
      order for the user to interact with the {{MediaSession}}. For example, a
      page can handle some actions that will then be triggered when the user
      presses buttons from a headset or other remote device.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>media session action source</dfn> is a source that might produce a <a>media session action</a>.
      Such a source can be the platform or the UI surfaces created by the user
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a>media session action source</a> has an optional
      <dfn for="media session action source">target</dfn> which should be the
      recipient of any <a>media session action</a> created by the
      <a>media session action source</a>. If a <a>media session action source</a>'s
      <a for="media session action source">target</a> is <code>null</code>,
      the <a>active media session</a> is the recipient of all
      <a>media session action source</a>'s actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <a>media session action</a> is represented by a {{MediaSessionAction}}
      which can have one of the following value:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>play</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to resume the playback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>pause</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to pause the currently active playback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekbackward</dfn>: the action's
          intent is to move the playback time backward by a short period (eg. a
          few seconds).
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekforward</dfn>: the action's
          intent is to move the playback time forward by a short period (eg. a
          few seconds).
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>previoustrack</dfn>: the action's
          intent is to either start the current playback from the beginning if
          the playback has a notion of beginning, or move to the previous item
          in the playlist if the playback has a notion of playlist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>nexttrack</dfn>: the action's
          intent is to move to the playback to the next item in the playlist if the
          playback has a notion of playlist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>skipad</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to skip the advertisement that is currently playing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>stop</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to stop the playback and clear the state if appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekto</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to move the playback time to a specific time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>togglemicrophone</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to mute or unmute the user's microphone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>togglecamera</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to turn the user's active camera on or off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>hangup</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to end a call.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>previousslide</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to go back to the previous slide when presenting slides.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>nextslide</dfn>: the action's intent
          is to go to the next slide when presenting slides.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      All {{MediaSession}}s have a map of <dfn>supported media session
      actions</dfn> with, as a key, a <a>media session action</a> and as a value
      a {{MediaSessionActionHandler}}.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the <dfn>update action handler algorithm</dfn> on a given
      {{MediaSession}} with <var>action</var> and <var>handler</var> parameters
      is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>handler</var> is <code>null</code>, remove <var>action</var>
          from the <a>supported media session actions</a> for {{MediaSession}}
          and abort these steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add <var>action</var> to the <a>supported media session actions</a>
          for {{MediaSession}} and associate to it the <var>handler</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      When the <a>supported media session actions</a> are changed, the user
      agent SHOULD run the <a>media session actions update algorithm</a>. The
      user agent MAY <a>queue a task</a> in order to run the <a>media session
      actions update algorithm</a> in order to avoid UI flickering when multiple
      actions are modified in the same event loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the user agent is notified by a <a>media session action source</a>
      named <var>source</var> that a
      <a>media session action</a> named <var>action</var> has been triggered,
      the user agent MUST run the <dfn>handle media session action</dfn> steps
      as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let <var>session</var> be <var>source</var>'s <a for="media session
          action source">target</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>session</var> is <code>null</code>, set <var>session</var> to
          the <a>active media session</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>session</var> is <code>null</code>, abort these steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let <var>actions</var> be <var>session</var>'s
          <a>supported media session actions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>actions</var> does not contain the key <var>action</var>,
          abort these steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let <var>handler</var> be the {{MediaSessionActionHandler}} associated
          with the key <var>action</var> in <var>actions</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <var>handler</var> with the <var>details</var> parameter set to:
          {{MediaSessionActionDetails}}.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the <a>activation notification</a> steps in the
          <a>browsing context</a> associated with <var>session</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      When the user agent receives a joint command for <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>play</a> and <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>pause</a>, such as a headset button click, it MUST
      run the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the <a>active media session</a> is <code>null</code>, abort these
          steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let <var>action</var> be a <a>media session action</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the <a>actual playback state</a> of the <a>active media session</a>
          is <a enum-value for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</a>, set
          <var>action</var> to <a enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>pause</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, set <var>action</var> to <a enum-value
          for=MediaSessionAction>play</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the <a>handle media session action</a> steps with
          <var>action</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is RECOMMENDED for user agents to implement a default handler for the
      <a enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>play</a> and <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>pause</a> <a>media session actions</a> if none was
      provided for the <a>active media session</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A user agent MAY implement a default handler for the <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>togglemicrophone</a>, <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>togglecamera</a>, or <a enum-value
      for=MediaSessionAction>hangup</a> <a>media session actions</a> if none was
      provided for the <a>active media session</a>.
    </p>

    <p class=note>
      A page should only register a {{MediaSessionActionHandler}} for a <a>media
      session action</a> when it can handle the action given that the user agent
      will list this as a <a>supported media session action</a> and update the
      <a>media session action sources</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the <dfn>media session actions update algorithm</dfn> is invoked, the
      user agent MUST run the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let <var>available actions</var> be an array of <a>media session
          actions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the <a>active media session</a> is null, set <var>available
          actions</var> to the empty array.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, set the <var>available actions</var> to the list of keys
          available in the <a>active media session</a>'s <a>supported media
          session actions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each <a>media session action source</a> <var>source</var>, run the
          following substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Optionally, if the <a>active media session</a> is not null:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If the <a>active media session</a>'s <a>actual playback
                  state</a> is <a enum-value
                  for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</a>, remove <a
                  enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>play</a> from <var>available
                  actions</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, remove <a enum-value
                  for=MediaSessionAction>pause</a> from <var>available

                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              If the <var>source</var> is a UI element created by the user
              agent, it MAY remove some elements from <var>available
              actions</var> if there are too many of them compared to the
              available space.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notify the <var>source</var> with the updated list of

    <h3 id='position-state'>Position State</h3>

    <p>
      A user agent MAY display the <a>current playback position</a> and
      <a>duration</a>
      of a media session in the platform UI depending on platform conventions.
      The
      <dfn>position state</dfn> is the combination of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>duration</dfn> of the media in seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>playback rate</dfn> of the media. It is a coefficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>last reported playback position</dfn> of the media. This is
          the playback position of the media in seconds when the <a>position
          state</a>
          was created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a>position state</a> is represented by a {{MediaPositionState}} which
      MUST always be stored with the <dfn>last position updated time</dfn>. This
      is the time the <a>position state</a> was last updated in seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The RECOMMENDED way to determine the <a>position state</a> is to monitor
      the media elements whose node document's browsing context is the
      <a>browsing context</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <dfn>actual playback rate</dfn> is a coefficient computed in the
      following way:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the <a>actual playback state</a> is <a enum-value
          for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">paused</a>, then return zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return <a>playback rate</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <dfn>current playback position</dfn> in seconds is computed in the
      following way:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Set <var>time elapsed</var> to the system time in seconds minus the
          <a>last position updated time</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mutliply <var>time elapsed</var> with <a>actual playback rate</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set <var>position</var> to <var>time elapsed</var> added to
          <a>last reported playback position</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>position</var> is less than zero, return zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>position</var> is greater than <a>duration</a>, return
          <a>duration</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return <var>position</var>.
        </li>
      </ul>

<p>
  A {{MediaSession}} object represents a media session for a given document and
  allows a document to communicate to the user agent some information about the
  playback and how to handle it.
</p>

<p>
  A {{MediaSession}} has an associated <dfn for="MediaSession">metadata</dfn>
  object represented by a {{MediaMetadata}}. It is initially <code>null</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn attribute for="Navigator"><code>mediaSession</code></dfn> attribute
  MUST return the {{MediaSession}} instance associated with the {{Navigator}}
  object.
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn attribute for="MediaSession"><code>metadata</code></dfn> attribute
  reflects the {{MediaSession}}'s <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a>. On getting,
  it MUST return the {{MediaSession}}'s <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a>. On
  setting, it MUST run the following steps with <var>value</var> being the new
  value being set:
  <ol>
    <li>
      If the {{MediaSession}}'s <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a> is not
      <code>null</code>, set its <a for=MediaMetadata>media session</a> to
      <code>null</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set the {{MediaSession}}'s <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a> to

    </li>
    <li>
      If the {{MediaSession}}'s <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a> is not

      current {{MediaSession}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a>In parallel</a>, run the <a>update metadata algorithm</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn attribute for="MediaSession"><code>playbackState</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the <dfn>declared playback state</dfn> of the <a>media
  session</a>, by which the session declares whether its <a>browsing context</a>
  is playing media or not. The initial value is <a enum-value
  for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">none</a>. On setting, the user agent MUST set
  the IDL attribute to the new value if it is a valid
  {{MediaSessionPlaybackState}} value. On getting, the user agent MUST return
  the last valid value that was set. The {{MediaSession/playbackState}}
  attribute is a hint for the user agent to determine whether the <a>browsing
  context</a> is playing or paused.
</p>

<p class=note>
  Setting {{MediaSession/playbackState}} may cause the <a>actual playback
  state</a> to change and run the <a>media session actions update algorithm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The {{MediaSessionPlaybackState}} enum is used to indicate whether a
  <a>browsing context</a> is playing media or not, the values are described as
  follows:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <dfn enum-value for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">none</dfn> means the
      <a>browsing context</a>
      does not specify whether it's playing or paused, it can only be used in
      the {{MediaSession/playbackState}} attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <dfn enum-value for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">playing</dfn> means the
      <a>browsing context</a> is currently playing media and it can be paused.
    </li>
    <li>
      <dfn enum-value for="MediaSessionPlaybackState">paused</dfn> means the
      <a>browsing context</a> has paused media and it can be resumed.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn method for=MediaSession>setActionHandler(action, handler)</dfn> method, when
  invoked, MUST run the <a>update action handler algorithm</a> with
  <var>action</var> and <var>handler</var> on the {{MediaSession}}.
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn method for=MediaSession>setPositionState(state)</dfn> method, when invoked
  MUST perform the following steps:

  <ul>
    <li>
      If the <var>state</var> is an empty dictionary then clear the <a>position
      state</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">duration</a> is not present
      or its value is null, throw a <a exception>TypeError</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">duration</a> is negative,
      throw a <a exception>TypeError</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">position</a> is not present
      or its value is null, set it to zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">position</a> is negative or
      greater than <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">duration</a>, throw a
      <a exception>TypeError</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">playbackRate</a> is not
      present or its value is null, set it to 1.0.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <a dict-member for="MediaPositionState">playbackRate</a> is zero
      throw a <a exception>TypeError</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Update the <a>position state</a> and <a>last position updated time</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn method for=MediaSession>setMicrophoneActive(active)</dfn> and
  <dfn method for=MediaSession>setCameraActive(active)</dfn> methods indicate to
  the user agent whether the microphone and camera are currently considered by
  the page to be active (e.g. if the microphone is considered "muted" by the
  page since it is no longer sending audio through to a call, then the page can
  invoke <code>setMicrophoneActive(false)</code>).
  It is RECOMMENDED that the user agent respect the microphone and camera
  states indicated by the page in this UI.
</p>

<p>
  The user agent MAY display UI which invokes handlers for
  <a>media session actions</a>.

<h2 id="the-mediaimage-dictionary">The {{MediaImage}} dictionary</h2>

<pre class="idl">

dictionary MediaImage {
  required USVString src;
  DOMString sizes = "";
  DOMString type = "";
};
</pre>

<p class="informative">The {{MediaImage}} dictionary members are inspired by
{{ImageResource}} in [[IMAGE-RESOURCE]].</p>

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaImage">src</dfn> <a>dictionary member</a> is used
to specify the {{MediaImage}} object's <dfn for="MediaImage">source</dfn>. It is
a URL from which the user agent can fetch the image's data.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaImage">sizes</dfn> <a>dictionary member</a> is
used to specify the {{MediaImage}} object's {{MediaImage/sizes}}. It follows the
spec of <a attribute for="HTMLLinkElement"><code>sizes</code></a> attribute in
the HTML
<a for="HTMLLinkElement"><code>link</code></a> element, which is a string
consisting of an <a>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a> which are
<a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> that represents the dimensions of an image. Each
keyword is either an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "any",
or a value that consists of two valid non-negative integers that do not have a
leading U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) character and that are separated by a single
U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X or U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X character. The
keywords represent icon sizes in raw pixels (as opposed to CSS pixels). When
multiple image objects are available, a user agent MAY use the value to decide
which icon is most suitable for a display context (and ignore any that are
inappropriate). The parsing steps for the {{MediaImage/sizes}} attribute MUST
follow <a attribute for="HTMLLinkElement" lt="sizes">the parsing steps for HTML
<code>link</code> element <code>sizes</code> attribute</a>.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaImage">type</dfn> <a>dictionary member</a> is
used to specify the {{MediaImage}} object's <a>MIME type</a>. It is a hint as to
the media type of the image. The purpose of this attribute is to allow a user
agent to ignore images of media types it does not support.

<h2 id="the-mediapositionstate-dictionary">The {{MediaPositionState}}
dictionary</h2>

<pre class="idl">

dictionary MediaPositionState {
  double duration;
  double playbackRate;
  double position;
};
</pre>

The {{MediaPositionState}} dictionary is a representation of the current
playback position associated with a {{MediaSession}} that can be used by user
agents to provide a user interface that displays the current playback position
and duration.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaPositionState">duration</dfn> <a>dictionary
member</a>
is used to specify the <a>duration</a> in seconds. It should always be positive
and positive infinity can be used to indicate media without a defined end such
as live playback.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaPositionState">playbackRate</dfn> <a>dictionary
member</a>
is used to specify the <a>playback rate</a>. It can be positive to represent
forward playback or negative to represent backwards playback. It should not be
zero.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaPositionState">position</dfn> <a>dictionary
member</a>
is used to specify the <a>last reported playback position</a> in seconds. It
should always be positive.

<h2 id="the-mediasessionactiondetails-dictionary">The
{{MediaSessionActionDetails}} dictionary</h2>

<pre class="idl">

dictionary MediaSessionActionDetails {
  required MediaSessionAction action;
  double seekOffset;
  double seekTime;
  boolean fastSeek;
};
</pre>

The {{MediaSessionActionHandler}} MUST be run with the <var>details</var>
parameter which is represented by a dictionary inherited from
{{MediaSessionActionDetails}}.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaSessionActionDetails">action</dfn> <a>dictionary
member</a>
is used to specify the <a>media session action</a> that the
{{MediaSessionActionHandler}} is associated with.

The <dfn dict-member for="MediaSessionActionDetails">seekOffset</dfn>
<a>dictionary member</a> MAY be provided when the <a>media session action</a>
is <a enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekbackward</a> or
<a enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekforward</a>. It is the time in seconds
to move the playback time by. If it is not provided then the site should choose
a sensible time (e.g. a few seconds).

When the <a>media session action</a> is
<a enum-value for=MediaSessionAction>seekto</a>:

<ul>
  <li>
    The <dfn dict-member for="MediaSessionActionDetails">seekTime</dfn>
    <a>dictionary member</a> MUST be provided and is the time in seconds to
    move the playback time to.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <dfn dict-member for="MediaSessionActionDetails">fastSeek</dfn>
    <a>dictionary member</a> MAY be provided and will be true if the
    <a lt="media session action">action</a> is being called multiple times
    as part of a sequence and this is not the last call in that sequence.
  </li>
</ul>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

<div class="example" id="example-setting-metadata">
  Setting <a for=MediaSession>metadata</a>:

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({

      artist: "Podcast Host",
      album: "Podcast Title",
      artwork: [{src: "podcast.jpg"}]
    });
  </pre>

  Alternatively, providing multiple <a for="MediaMetadata" title="artwork
  image">artwork images</a> in the metadata can let the user agent be able to
  select different artwork images for different display purposes and better fit
  for different screens:

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
      title: "Episode Title",
      artist: "Podcast Host",
      album: "Podcast Title",
      artwork: [
        {src: "podcast.jpg", sizes: "128x128", type: "image/jpeg"},
        {src: "podcast_hd.jpg", sizes: "256x256"},
        {src: "podcast_xhd.jpg", sizes: "1024x1024", type: "image/jpeg"},
        {src: "podcast.png", sizes: "128x128", type: "image/png"},
        {src: "podcast_hd.png", sizes: "256x256", type: "image/png"},
        {src: "podcast.ico", sizes: "128x128 256x256", type: "image/x-icon"}
      ]
    });
  </pre>

  For example, if the user agent wants to use an image as icon, it may choose
  <code>"podcast.jpg"</code> or <code>"podcast.png"</code> for a
  low-pixel-density screen, and <code>"podcast_hd.jpg"</code>
  or <code>"podcast_hd.png"</code> for a high-pixel-density screen. If the user
  agent wants to use an image for lockscreen background,
  <code>"podcast_xhd.jpg"</code> will be preferred.
