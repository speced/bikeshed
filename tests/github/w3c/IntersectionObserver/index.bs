Abstract: This specification describes  an API that can be used to understand the visibility and position of DOM elements ("targets") relative to a containing element or to the top-level viewport ("root"). The position is delivered asynchronously and is useful for understanding the visibility of elements and implementing pre-loading and deferred loading of DOM content.

<h2 id='introduction'>Introduction</h2>

The web's traditional position calculation mechanisms
rely on explicit queries of DOM state
that are known to cause (expensive) style recalculation and layout
and, frequently, are a source of significant performance overhead
due to continuous polling for this information.

A body of common practice has evolved that relies on these behaviors,
however, including (but not limited to):

* Building custom pre- and deferred-loading of DOM and data.
* Implementing data-bound high-performance scrolling lists
	which load and render subsets of data sets.
	These lists are a central mobile interaction idiom.
* Calculating element visibility.
	In particular,
	<a href="http://www.iab.net/iablog/2014/03/viewability-has-arrived-what-you-need-to-know-to-see-through-this-sea-change.html">
	ad networks now require reporting of ad "visibility" for monetizing impressions</a>. This has led to many sites abusing scroll handlers
	(causing jank on scroll),
	<a href="http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html">
	synchronous layout invoking readbacks</a>
	(causing unnecessary critical work in rAF loops),
	and resorting to exotic plugin-based solutions for computing "true" element visibility (with all the associated overhead of the plugin architecture).

These use-cases have several common properties:

1. They can be represented as passive "queries"
	about the state of individual elements
	with respect to some other element
	(or the global viewport).
2. They do not impose hard latency requirements;
	that is to say, the information can be delivered asynchronously
	(e.g. from another thread)
	without penalty.
3. They are poorly supported by nearly all combinations of existing web platform features,
	requiring extraordinary developer effort despite their widespread use.

A notable non-goal is pixel-accurate information about what was actually displayed
(which can be quite difficult to obtain efficiently in certain browser architectures
in the face of filters, webgl, and other features).
In all of these scenarios the information is useful
even when delivered at a slight delay
and without perfect compositing-result data.

The Intersection Observer API addresses the above issues
by giving developers a new method to asynchronously query the position of an element
with respect to other elements or the global viewport.
The asynchronous delivery eliminates the need for costly DOM and style queries,
continuous polling,
and use of custom plugins.
By removing the need for these methods
it allows applications to significantly reduce their CPU, GPU and energy costs.

<div class="example">
	<pre highlight="js">
	var observer = new IntersectionObserver(changes => {
		for (const change of changes) {
			console.log(change.time);               // Timestamp when the change occurred
			console.log(change.rootBounds);         // Unclipped area of root
			console.log(change.boundingClientRect); // target.boundingClientRect()
			console.log(change.intersectionRect);   // boundingClientRect, clipped by its containing block ancestors, and intersected with rootBounds
			console.log(change.intersectionRatio);  // Ratio of intersectionRect area to boundingClientRect area
			console.log(change.target);             // the Element target
		}
	}, {});

	// Watch for intersection events on a specific target Element.
	observer.observe(target);

	// Stop watching for intersection events on a specific target Element.
	observer.unobserve(target);

	// Stop observing threshold events on all target elements.
	observer.disconnect();

<h2 id='intersection-observer-api'>Intersection Observer</h2>

The <dfn>Intersection Observer</dfn> API enables developers to understand the
visibility and position of <dfn for="IntersectionObserver">target</dfn> DOM
elements relative to an <a>intersection root</a>.

<h3 id='intersection-observer-callback'>
The IntersectionObserverCallback</h3>

<pre class="idl">
	callback IntersectionObserverCallback = void (sequence&lt;IntersectionObserverEntry> entries, IntersectionObserver observer);
</pre>

This callback will be invoked when there are changes to <a>target</a>'s
intersection with the <a>intersection root</a>, as per the
<a>processing model</a>.

<h3 id='intersection-observer-interface'>
The IntersectionObserver interface</h3>

The {{IntersectionObserver}} interface can be used to observe changes in the
intersection of an <a>intersection root</a> and one or more <a>target</a> {{Element}}s.

An {{IntersectionObserver}} with a {{IntersectionObserver/root}} {{Element}} can
observe any <a>target</a> {{Element}} that is a descendant of the
{{IntersectionObserver/root}} in the <a>containing block chain</a>.

An {{IntersectionObserver}} with no {{IntersectionObserver/root}} {{Element}}
will automatically observe intersections with the <a>implicit root</a>,
and valid <a>targets</a> include any {{Element}} in the
<a>top-level browsing context</a>, as well as any {{Element}} in any
<a>nested browsing contexts</a> inside the <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

Note: In {{MutationObserver}}, the {{MutationObserverInit}} options are passed
to {{MutationObserver/observe()}} while in {{IntersectionObserver}} they are
passed to the constructor. This is because for MutationObserver, each {{Node}}
being observed could have a different set of attributes to filter for. For
{{IntersectionObserver}}, developers may choose to use a single observer to
track multiple targets using the same set of options; or they may use a different
observer for each tracked target.

{{IntersectionObserverInit/rootMargin}} or {{threshold}} values for each
<a>target</a> seems to introduce more complexity without solving additional
use-cases. Per-{{observe()}} options could be provided in the future if V2
introduces a need for it.

<pre class="idl">
[Constructor(IntersectionObserverCallback callback, optional IntersectionObserverInit options),
 Exposed=Window]
interface IntersectionObserver {
	readonly attribute Element? root;
	readonly attribute DOMString rootMargin;
	readonly attribute FrozenArray&lt;double&gt; thresholds;
	void observe(Element target);
	void unobserve(Element target);
	void disconnect();
	sequence&lt;IntersectionObserverEntry> takeRecords();
};

<div dfn-type="method" dfn-for="IntersectionObserver">
	: <dfn constructor lt="IntersectionObserver(callback, options)">
		new IntersectionObserver(callback, options)</dfn>
	::
		1. Let |this| be a new {{IntersectionObserver}} object
		2. Set |this|'s internal {{[[callback]]}} slot to |callback|.
		3. Set |this|.|root| to |options|.|root|.
		4. Attempt to <a>parse a root margin</a>
			from |options|.|rootMargin|.
			If a list is returned,
			set |this|'s internal {{[[rootMargin]]}} slot to that.
			Otherwise, <a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}} exception.
		5. Let |thresholds| be a list equal to
			|options|.|threshold|.
		6. If any value in |thresholds| is less than 0.0 or greater than
			1.0, <a>throw</a> a {{RangeError}} exception.
		7. Sort |thresholds| in ascending order.
		8. If |thresholds| is empty, append <code>0</code> to |thresholds|.
		9. Set |this|.|thresholds| to |thresholds|.
		10. Return |this|.
	: <dfn>observe(target)</dfn>
	::
		1. If |target| is in |this|'s internal {{[[ObservationTargets]]}} slot,
			return.
		2. Let |intersectionObserverRegistration| be
			an {{IntersectionObserverRegistration}} record

			a {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousThresholdIndex}} property set to <code>-1</code>,
			and a {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousIsIntersecting}} property set to <code>false</code>.
		3. Append |intersectionObserverRegistration|
			to |target|'s internal {{[[RegisteredIntersectionObservers]]}} slot.
		4. Add |target| to |this|'s internal {{[[ObservationTargets]]}} slot.
		5. Schedule an iteration of the <a>event loop</a>

		2. Remove |target| from |this|'s internal {{[[ObservationTargets]]}} slot.

		Note: {{MutationObserver}} does not implement {{unobserve()}}.
		For {{IntersectionObserver}}, {{unobserve()}} addresses the
		lazy-loading use case. After |target| becomes visible,
		it does not need to be tracked.
		It would be more work to either {{disconnect()}} all |target|s
		and {{observe()}} the remaining ones,
		or create a separate {{IntersectionObserver}} for each |target|.
	: <dfn>disconnect()</dfn>
	::
		For each |target| in |this|'s internal {{[[ObservationTargets]]}} slot:

		1. Remove the {{IntersectionObserverRegistration}} record

			from |target|'s internal {{[[RegisteredIntersectionObservers]]}} slot.
		2. Remove |target| from |this|'s internal {{[[ObservationTargets]]}} slot.

</div>

<div dfn-type="attribute" dfn-for="IntersectionObserver">
	: <dfn>root</dfn>
	::
		The root {{Element}} to use for intersection, or <code>null</code> if the
		observer uses the <a>implicit root</a>.
	: <dfn>rootMargin</dfn>
	::
		Offsets applied to the <a>intersection root's</a> bounding box,
		effectively growing or shrinking the box that is used to calculate intersections.
		Note that {{IntersectionObserver/rootMargin}} is only applied
		for <a>targets</a> which belong to the same <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a>
		as the <a>intersection root</a>.

		On getting, return the result of serializing the elements of {{[[rootMargin]]}}
		space-separated, where pixel lengths serialize as the numeric value followed by "px",
		and percentages serialize as the numeric value followed by "%".  Note that
		this is not guaranteed to be identical to the |options|.{{IntersectionObserverInit/rootMargin}}
		passed to the {{IntersectionObserver}} constructor.  If no
		{{IntersectionObserverInit/rootMargin}} was passed to the {{IntersectionObserver}}
		constructor, the value of this attribute is "0px 0px 0px 0px".
	: <dfn>thresholds</dfn>
	::
		A list of thresholds, sorted in increasing numeric order,
		where each threshold is a ratio of intersection area to bounding box area
		of an observed target.  Notifications for a target are generated when any
		of the thresholds are crossed for that target.
		If no |options|.{{IntersectionObserverInit/threshold}} was provided to the
		{{IntersectionObserver}} constructor, the value of this attribute will be [0].
</div>

The <dfn for="IntersectionObserver">intersection root</dfn>
for an {{IntersectionObserver}} is the value of its {{IntersectionObserver/root}} attribute,
or else the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>document</a> node
(referred to as the <dfn for="IntersectionObserver">implicit root</dfn>) if
the {{IntersectionObserver/root}} attribute is <code>null</code>.

The <dfn for=IntersectionObserver>root intersection rectangle</dfn>
for an {{IntersectionObserver}}
is the rectangle we'll use to check against the targets.

<dl class=switch>
	<dt>If the <a>intersection root</a> is the <a>implicit root</a>,
	<dd>it's the viewport's size.

	<dt>If the <a>intersection root</a> has an overflow clip,
	<dd>it's the element's <a>content area</a>.

	<dt>Otherwise,
	<dd>it's the result of running the {{Element/getBoundingClientRect()}} algorithm on the <a>intersection root</a>.
</dl>

For any <a>target</a> which belongs to the same <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a>
as the <a>intersection root</a>,
the rectangle is then expanded
according to the offsets in the {{IntersectionObserver}}’s {{[[rootMargin]]}} slot
in a manner similar to CSS's 'margin' property,
with the four values indicating the amount the top, right, bottom, and left edges, respectively, are offset by,
with positive lengths indicating an outward offset.
Percentages are resolved relative to the width of the undilated rectangle.

Note: {{IntersectionObserver/rootMargin}} only applies to the <a>intersection root</a> itself.
If a <a>target</a> {{Element}} is clipped by an ancestor other than the
<a>intersection root</a>, that clipping is unaffected by
{{IntersectionObserver/rootMargin}}.

Note: <a>Root intersection rectangle</a> is not affected by
<a>pinch zoom</a> and will report the unadjusted <a>viewport</a>, consistent with the
intent of pinch zooming (to act like a magnifying glass and NOT change layout.)

To <dfn>parse a root margin</dfn>
from an input string |marginString|,
returning either a list of 4 pixel lengths or percentages,
or failure:

1. <a>Parse a list of component values</a> |marginString|,
	storing the result as |tokens|.
2. Remove all whitespace tokens from |tokens|.
3. If the length of |tokens| is 0 or greater than 4,
	return failure.
4. Replace each |token| in |tokens|:
	* If |token| is an <a>absolute length</a> <a>dimension</a> token,
		replace it with a an equivalent pixel length.
	* If |token| is a <<percentage>> token,
		replace it with an equivalent percentage.
	* Otherwise, return failure.
5. If there is one element in |tokens|,
	append three duplicates of that element to |tokens|.
	If there is two elements are |tokens|,
	append a duplicate of each element to |tokens|.
	If there are three elements in |tokens|,
	append a duplicate of the second element to |tokens|.
6. Return |tokens|.

	: <dfn>isIntersecting</dfn>
	::
		True if the {{IntersectionObserverEntry/target}} intersects with the

		possible to distinguish between an {{IntersectionObserverEntry}} signalling
		the transition from intersecting to not-intersecting; and an
		{{IntersectionObserverEntry}} signalling a transition from not-intersecting
		to intersecting with a zero-area intersection rect (as will happen with
		edge-adjacent intersections, or when the {{IntersectionObserverEntry/boundingClientRect}}
		has zero area).
	: <dfn>intersectionRatio</dfn>
	::
		If the {{IntersectionObserverEntry/boundingClientRect}} has non-zero area,
		this will be the ratio of {{IntersectionObserverEntry/intersectionRect}} area to

		5. Let |targetArea| be |targetRect|'s area.
		6. Let |intersectionArea| be |intersectionRect|'s area.
		7. Let |isIntersecting| be true if |targetRect| and |rootBounds| intersect or are edge-adjacent,
			even if the intersection has zero area (because |rootBounds| or |targetRect| have
			zero area); otherwise, let |isIntersecting| be false.
		8. If |targetArea| is non-zero, let |intersectionRatio| be |intersectionArea| divided by |targetArea|.<br>
			Otherwise, let |intersectionRatio| be <code>1</code> if |isIntersecting| is true, or <code>0</code> if |isIntersecting| is false.
		9. Let |thresholdIndex| be the index of the first entry in |observer|.{{thresholds}} whose value is greater than |intersectionRatio|, or the length of |observer|.{{thresholds}} if |intersectionRatio| is greater than or equal to the last entry in |observer|.{{thresholds}}.
		10. Let |intersectionObserverRegistration| be the {{IntersectionObserverRegistration}} record 
			in |target|'s internal {{[[RegisteredIntersectionObservers]]}} slot
			whose {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/observer}} property is equal to |observer|.
		11. Let |previousThresholdIndex| be the |intersectionObserverRegistration|'s
		    {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousThresholdIndex}} property.
		12. Let |previousIsIntersecting| be the |intersectionObserverRegistration|'s
		    {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousIsIntersecting}} property.
		13. If |thresholdIndex| does not equal |previousThresholdIndex| or if 
		    |isIntersecting| does not equal |previousIsIntersecting|,
			<a>queue an IntersectionObserverEntry</a>,
			passing in |observer|, |time|, |rootBounds|,
			|boundingClientRect|, |intersectionRect|, |isIntersecting|, and |target|.
		14. Assign |threshold| to |intersectionObserverRegistration|'s
		    {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousThresholdIndex}} property.
        15. Assign |isIntersecting| to |intersectionObserverRegistration|'s
		    {{IntersectionObserverRegistration/previousIsIntersecting}} property.

IntersectionObserver Lifetime</h2>

An {{IntersectionObserver}} will remain alive until both of these conditions hold:
<ul>
	<li>There are no scripting references to the observer.</li>
	<li>The observer is not observing any targets.
</ul>

An {{IntersectionObserver}} will continue observing a target until either {{IntersectionObserver/unobserve(target)}} is called on the target, or {{IntersectionObserver/disconnect()}} is called on the observer.

HTML Processing Model: Event Loop</h4>

An <a>Intersection Observer</a> processing step should take place
during the "<i>Update the rendering</i>" steps,
after step 9, <a>run the fullscreen rendering steps</a>,
and before step 10, <a>run the animation frame callbacks</a>,
in the in the <a>HTML Processing Model</a>.

This step is:

<ol start="10">
	<li>For each <a>fully active</a> <a>Document</a> in |docs|, <a>Run the update intersection observations steps</a> for each {{IntersectionObserver}} whose {{IntersectionObserver/root}} is in the DOMtree of that <a>Document</a>.</li>
</ol>
