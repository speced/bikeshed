# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

This document defines fundamental infrastructure for file system APIs. In addition, it defines an
API that makes it possible for websites to get access to a file system directory without having to
first prompt the user for access. This enables use cases where a website wants to save data to disk
before a user has picked a location to save to, without forcing the website to use a completely
different storage mechanism with a different API for such files. The entry point for this is the
{{StorageManager/getDirectory()|navigator.storage.getDirectory()}} method.


# Files and Directories # {#files-and-directories}

## Concepts ## {#concepts}

A <dfn export id="entry">file system entry</dfn> is either a [=file entry=] or a [=directory entry=].

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated <dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-query-access>query access</dfn> algorithm, which takes "`read`"
or "`readwrite`" <var ignore>mode</var> and returns a {{PermissionState}}. Unless specified
otherwise it returns "{{PermissionState/denied}}". The algorithm is allowed to throw.

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated <dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-request-access>request access</dfn> algorithm, which takes
"`read`" or "`readwrite`" <var ignore>mode</var> and returns a {{PermissionState}}. Unless specified
otherwise it returns "{{PermissionState/denied}}". The algorithm is allowed to throw.

Note: Implementations that only implement this specification and not dependent specifications do not
need to bother implementing [=/file system entry=]'s [=file system entry/query access=] and [=file system entry/request access=].

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated <dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-name>name</dfn> (a [=string=]).

A <dfn>valid file name</dfn> is a [=string=] that is not an empty string, is not equal to "." or "..",
and does not contain '/' or any other character used as path separator on the underlying platform.

Note: This means that '\' is not allowed in names on Windows, but might be allowed on
other operating systems. Additionally underlying file systems might have further restrictions
on what names are or aren't allowed, so a string merely being a [=valid file name=] is not
a guarantee that creating a file or directory with that name will succeed.

Issue: We should consider having further normative restrictions on file names that will
never be allowed using this API, rather than leaving it entirely up to underlying file
systems.

A <dfn export id=file>file entry</dfn> additionally consists of
<dfn for="file entry" export>binary data</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]), a
<dfn for="file entry">modification timestamp</dfn> (a number representing the number of milliseconds since the <a spec=FileAPI>Unix Epoch</a>),
a <dfn for="file entry">lock</dfn> (a string that may exclusively be "`open`", "`taken-exclusive`" or "`taken-shared`")
and a <dfn for="file entry">shared lock count</dfn> (a number representing the number shared locks that are taken at a given point in time).

<div algorithm>
To <dfn for="file entry/lock">take</dfn> a [=file entry/lock=] with a |value| of "`exclusive`" or "`shared`" on a given [=file entry=] |file|:

1. Let |lock| be the |file|'s [=file entry/lock=].
1. Let |count| be the |file|'s [=file entry/shared lock count=].
1. If |value| is "`exclusive`":
   1. If |lock| is "`open`":
     1. Set lock to "`taken-exclusive`".
     1. Return true.
1. If |value| is "`shared`":
   1. If |lock| is "`open`":
     1. Set |lock| to "`taken-shared`".
     1. Set |count| to 1.
     1. Return true.
   1. Otherwise, if |lock| is "`taken-shared`":
     1. Increase |count| by one.
     1. Return true.
1. Return false.

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn for="file entry/lock">release</dfn> a [=file entry/lock=] on a given [=file entry=] |file|,
run these steps:

1. Let |lock| be the |file|'s associated [=file entry/lock=].
1. Let |count| be the |file|'s [=file entry/shared lock count=].
1. If |lock| is "`taken-shared`":
  1. Decrease |count| by one.
  1. If |count| is 0, set |lock| to "`open`".
1. Otherwise, set |lock| to "`open`".

</div>

Note: Locks help prevent concurrent modifications to a file. A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}}
requires a shared lock, while a {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} requires an exclusive one.

A <dfn export id=directory>directory entry</dfn> additionally consists of a [=/set=] of
<dfn for="directory entry">children</dfn>, which are themselves [=/file system entries=].
Each member is either a [=/file entry=] or a [=/directory entry=].

A [=/file system entry=] |entry| should be [=list/contained=] in the [=children=] of at most one
[=directory entry=], and that directory entry is also known as |entry|'s
<dfn export for="file system entry" id=entry-parent>parent</dfn>.
A [=/file system entry=]'s [=file system entry/parent=] is null if no such directory entry exists.

Note: Two different [=/file system entries=] can represent the same file or directory on disk, in which
case it is possible for both entries to have a different parent, or for one entry to have a
parent while the other entry does not have a parent.

[=/File system entries=] can (but don't have to) be backed by files on the host operating system's local file system,
so it is possible for the [=binary data=], [=modification timestamp=],
and [=children=] of entries to be modified by applications outside of this specification.
Exactly how external changes are reflected in the data structures defined by this specification,
as well as how changes made to the data structures defined here are reflected externally
is left up to individual user-agent implementations.

A [=/file system entry=] |a| is <dfn for="entry">the same as</dfn> an [=/file system entry=] |b| if |a| is equal to |b|, or
if |a| and |b| are backed by the same file or directory on the local file system.

Issue(59): Explain better how entries map to files on disk (multiple entries can map to the same file or
directory on disk but an entry doesn't have to map to any file on disk).

<div algorithm>

To <dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-resolve>resolve</dfn> a [=/file system entry=] |child| relative to a [=directory entry=] |root|,
run these steps:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. If |child| is [=the same as=] |root|,
     [=/resolve=] |result| with an empty list, and abort.
  1. Let |childPromises| be « ».
  1. [=set/For each=] |entry| of |root|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=]'s [=children=]:
    1. Let |p| be the result of [=file system entry/resolving=] |child| relative to |entry|.
    1. [=list/Append=] |p| to |childPromises|.
    1. [=Upon fulfillment=] of |p| with value |path|:
      1. If |path| is not null:
        1. [=list/Prepend=] |entry|'s [=file system entry/name=] to |path|.
        1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |path|.
  1. [=Wait for all=] |childPromises|, with the these success steps:
    1. If |result| hasn't been resolved yet, [=/resolve=] |result| with `null`.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

## The {{FileSystemHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemhandle}

<xmp class=idl>
enum FileSystemHandleKind {
  "file",
  "directory",
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker), SecureContext, Serializable]
interface FileSystemHandle {
  readonly attribute FileSystemHandleKind kind;
  readonly attribute USVString name;

  Promise<boolean> isSameEntry(FileSystemHandle other);
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemHandle}} object represents a [=/file system entry=]. Each {{FileSystemHandle}} object is associated
with an <dfn for=FileSystemHandle export>entry</dfn> (a [=/file system entry=]). Multiple separate objects implementing
the {{FileSystemHandle}} interface can all be associated with the same [=/file system entry=] simultaneously.

<div algorithm="serialization steps">
{{FileSystemHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=].

Their [=serialization steps=], given |value|, |serialized| and <var ignore>forStorage</var> are:

1. Set |serialized|.\[[Origin]] to |value|'s [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=].
1. Set |serialized|.\[[Entry]] to |value|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].

</div>

<div algorithm="deserialization steps">
Their [=deserialization steps=], given |serialized| and |value| are:

1. If |serialized|.\[[Origin]] is not [=same origin=] with
   |value|'s [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=],
   then [=throw=] a "{{DataCloneError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Set |value|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] to |serialized|.\[[Entry]]

</div>

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/kind}}
  :: Returns {{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}} if |handle| is a {{FileSystemFileHandle}},
     or {{FileSystemHandleKind/"directory"}} if |handle| is a {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}}.

     This can be used to distinguish files from directories when iterating over the contents
     of a directory.

  : |handle| . {{FileSystemHandle/name}}
  :: Returns the [=file system entry/name=] of the entry represented by |handle|.
</div>

The <dfn attribute for=FileSystemHandle>kind</dfn> getter steps are to return
{{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}} if [=this=] is a [=file entry=]; otherwise
{{FileSystemHandleKind/"directory"}}.

The <dfn attribute for=FileSystemHandle>name</dfn> getter steps are to return [=this=]'s [=file system entry/name=].

### The {{FileSystemHandle/isSameEntry()}} method ### {#api-filesystemhandle-issameentry}

<div class="note domintro">
  : <var ignore>same</var> = await |handle1| . {{FileSystemHandle/isSameEntry()|isSameEntry}}( |handle2| )
  :: Returns true if |handle1| and |handle2| represent the same file or directory.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemHandle>isSameEntry(|other|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |realm| be [=this=]'s [=relevant Realm=].
1. Let |p| be [=a new promise=] in |realm|.
1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. If [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] is [=the same as=] |other|'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=],
     [=/resolve=] |p| with true.
  1. Otherwise [=/resolve=] |p| with false.
1. Return |p|.

</div>

## The {{FileSystemFileHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemfilehandle}

<xmp class=idl>
dictionary FileSystemCreateWritableOptions {
  boolean keepExistingData = false;
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker), SecureContext, Serializable]
interface FileSystemFileHandle : FileSystemHandle {
  Promise<File> getFile();
  Promise<FileSystemWritableFileStream> createWritable(optional FileSystemCreateWritableOptions options = {});
  [Exposed=DedicatedWorker]
  Promise<FileSystemSyncAccessHandle> createSyncAccessHandle();
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemFileHandle}}'s associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] must be a [=file entry=].

{{FileSystemFileHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=] and
[=deserialization steps=] are the same as those for {{FileSystemHandle}}.

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/getFile()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-getfile}

<div class="note domintro">
  : <var ignore>file</var> = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/getFile()}}
  :: Returns a {{File}} representing the state on disk of the entry represented by |handle|.
     If the file on disk changes or is removed after this method is called, the returned
     {{File}} object will likely be no longer readable.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemFileHandle>getFile()</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |access| be the result of running [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=]'s
     [=file system entry/query access=] given "`read`".
  1. If |access| is not "{{PermissionState/granted}}",
     [=/reject=] |result| with a "{{NotAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |entry| be [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. Let |f| be a new {{File}}.
  1. Set |f|'s <a spec=FileAPI>snapshot state</a> to the current state of |entry|.
  1. Set |f|'s underlying byte sequence to a copy of |entry|'s [=binary data=].
  1. Set |f|.{{File/name}} to |entry|'s [=file system entry/name=].
  1. Set |f|.{{File/lastModified}} to |entry|'s [=file entry/modification timestamp=].
  1. Set |f|.{{Blob/type}} to an [=implementation-defined=] value, based on for example |entry|'s [=file system entry/name=] or its file extension.

     Issue: The reading and snapshotting behavior needs to be better specified in the [[FILE-API]] spec,
     for now this is kind of hand-wavy.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |f|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-createwritable}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |stream| = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()}}
  : |stream| = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()|createWritable}}({ {{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}}: true/false })
  :: Returns a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} that can be used to write to the file. Any changes made through
     |stream| won't be reflected in the file represented by |fileHandle| until the stream has been closed.
     User agents try to ensure that no partial writes happen, i.e. the file represented by
     |fileHandle| will either contain its old contents or it will contain whatever data was written
     through |stream| up until the stream has been closed.

     This is typically implemented by writing data to a temporary file, and only replacing the file
     represented by |fileHandle| with the temporary file when the writable filestream is closed.

     If {{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}} is false or not specified,
     the temporary file starts out empty,
     otherwise the existing file is first copied to this temporary file.

     Creating a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} [=file entry/lock/take|takes a shared lock=] on the
     [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] associated with |fileHandle|. This prevents the creation of
     {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle|FileSystemSyncAccessHandles}} for the entry, until the stream is closed.
</div>

<p class=XXX>See <a href=https://github.com/WICG/file-system-access/issues/67>WICG/file-system-access issue #67</a>
for discussion around and desire for a "inPlace" mode for createWritable (where
changes will be written to the actual underlying file as they are written to the
writer, for example to support in-place modification of large files or things
like databases). This is not currently implemented in Chrome. Implementing this
is currently blocked on figuring out how to combine the desire to run malware
checks with the desire to let websites make fast in-place modifications to
existing large files. In-place writes are available for files in the [=origin
private file system=] via the {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} interface.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemFileHandle>createWritable(|options|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |access| be the result of running [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=]'s
     [=file system entry/request access=] given "`readwrite`".
     If that throws an exception, [=reject=] |result| with that exception and abort.
  1. If |access| is not "{{PermissionState/granted}}",
     [=reject=] |result| with a "{{NotAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |entry| be [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. Let |lockResult| be the result of [=file entry/lock/take|taking a lock=] with "`shared`" on |entry|.
  1. If |lockResult| is false, [=reject=] |result| with a "{{NoModificationAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |stream| be the result of [=create a new FileSystemWritableFileStream|creating a new FileSystemWritableFileStream=]
     for |entry| in [=this=]'s [=relevant realm=].
  1. If |options|.{{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}} is true:
    1. Set |stream|.[=[[buffer]]=] to a copy of |entry|'s [=file entry/binary data=].
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |stream|.
1. Return |result|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/createSyncAccessHandle()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-createsyncaccesshandle}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| = await |fileHandle| . {{FileSystemFileHandle/createSyncAccessHandle()|createSyncAccessHandle}}()
  :: Returns a {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} that can be used to read from/write to the file.
     Changes made through |handle| might be immediately reflected in the file represented by |fileHandle|.
     To ensure the changes are reflected in this file, the handle can be flushed.

     Creating a {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} [=file entry/lock/take|takes an exclusive lock=] on the
     [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] associated with |fileHandle|. This prevents the creation of
     further {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}}s or {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}}s
     for the entry, until the access handle is closed.

     The returned {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} offers synchronous methods. This allows for higher performance
     on contexts where asynchronous operations come with high overhead, e.g., WebAssembly.

     For the time being, this method will only succeed when the |fileHandle| belongs to the
     [=origin private file system=].
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemFileHandle>createSyncAccessHandle()</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. Run these steps [=in parallel=]:
  1. Let |access| be the result of running [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=]'s
     [=file system entry/request access=] given "`readwrite`".
     If that throws an exception, [=reject=] |result| with that exception and abort.
  1. If |access| is not "{{PermissionState/granted}}",
     [=reject=] |result| with a "{{NotAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |entry| be [=this=]'s [=FileSystemHandle/entry=].
  1. If |entry| does not represent a [=/file system entry=] in an [=origin private file system=],
     [=reject=] |result| with an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |lockResult| be the result of [=file entry/lock/take|taking a lock=] with "`exclusive`" on |entry|.
  1. If |lockResult| is false, [=reject=] |result| with a "{{NoModificationAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort.
  1. Let |handle| be the result of [=create a new FileSystemSyncAccessHandle|creating a new FileSystemSyncAccessHandle=]
     for |entry| in [=this=]'s [=relevant realm=].
  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |handle|.
1. Return |result|.

</xmp>

A {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}}'s associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] must be a [=directory entry=].

{{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}} objects are [=serializable objects=]. Their [=serialization steps=] and
[=deserialization steps=] are the same as those for {{FileSystemHandle}}.

### Directory iteration ### {#api-filesystemdirectoryhandle-asynciterable}

     that are created or deleted while the iteration is in progress might or might not be included.
     No guarantees are given either way.

Issue(15): In the future we might want to add arguments to the async iterable declaration to
support for example recursive iteration.

<div algorithm="iterator initialization">
The [=asynchronous iterator initialization steps=] for a {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}} |handle|

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[file]]</dfn> (a [=file entry=]).

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[buffer]]</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]).
It is initially empty.

Note: This buffer can get arbitrarily large, so it is expected that implementations will not keep this in memory,
but instead use a temporary file for this. All access to \[[buffer]] is done in promise returning methods and
algorithms, so even though operations on it seem sync, implementations can implement them async.

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[seekOffset]]</dfn> (a number).
It is initially 0.

<div class="note domintro">
A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object is a {{WritableStream}} object with additional
convenience methods, which operates on a single file on disk.

Upon creation, an underlying sink will have been created and the stream will be usable.
All operations executed on the stream are queuable and producers will be able to respond to backpressure.

The underlying sink's write method, and therefore {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}}
method, will accept byte-like data or {{WriteParams}} as input.

The {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has a file position cursor initialized at byte offset 0 from the top of the file.
When using {{FileSystemWritableFileStream/write()|write()}} or by using WritableStream capabilities through the {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}} method, this position will be advanced based on the number of bytes written through the stream object.

Similarly, when piping a {{ReadableStream}} into a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object, this position is updated with the number of bytes that passed through the stream.

{{WritableStream/getWriter()|getWriter()}} returns an instance of {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}}.

To <dfn>create a new FileSystemSyncAccessHandle</dfn> given a [=file entry=] |file|
in a [=/Realm=] |realm|, run these steps:

1. Let |handle| be a [=new=] {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} in |realm|.
1. Set |handle|.[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=] to |file|.
1. Set |handle|.[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[state]]=] to "`open`".
1. Return |handle|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/read()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-read}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/read()|read}}(|buffer|)
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/read()|read}}(|buffer|, { {{FileSystemReadWriteOptions/at}} })
  :: Reads the contents of the file associated with |handle| into |buffer|, optionally at a given offset.
  :: The file cursor is updated when {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/read()}} is called to point to the byte after the last byte read.
</div>

Issue(35): Specify how Access Handles should react when reading from a file that has been modified externally.

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>read(|buffer|, {{FileSystemReadWriteOptions}}: |options|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=].[=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
   {{DOMException}}.
1. Let |bufferSize| be |buffer|'s [=byte length=].
1. Let |fileContents| be [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. Let |fileSize| be |fileContents|'s [=byte sequence/length=].
1. Let |readStart| be |options|["{{FileSystemReadWriteOptions/at}}"] if
   |options|["{{FileSystemReadWriteOptions/at}}"] [=map/exists=]; otherwise
   [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=].
1. If the underlying file system does not support reading from a file offset of
   |readStart|, [=throw=] a {{TypeError}}.
1. If |readStart| is larger than |fileSize|:
    1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |fileSize|.
    1. Return 0.
1. Let |readEnd| be |readStart| + (|bufferSize| &minus; 1).
1. If |readEnd| is larger than |fileSize|, set |readEnd| to |fileSize|.
1. Let |bytes| be a [=byte sequence=] containing the bytes from |readStart| to |readEnd| of |fileContents|.
1. Let |result| be |bytes|'s [=byte sequence/length=].
1. If the operations reading from |fileContents| in the previous steps failed:
    1. If there were partial reads and the number of bytes that were read into |bytes| is known,
       set |result| to the number of read bytes.
    1. Otherwise set |result| to 0.
1. Let |arrayBuffer| be |buffer|'s [=underlying buffer=].
1. [=ArrayBuffer/write|Write=] |bytes| into |arrayBuffer|.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |readStart| + |result|.
1. Return |result|.

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/write()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-write}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/write()|write}}(|buffer|)

</div>

<!-- TODO(fivedots): Figure out how to properly check the available storage quota (in this method and others) by passing the right storage shelf. -->
<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>write(|buffer|, {{FileSystemReadWriteOptions}}: |options|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=].[=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
   {{DOMException}}.
1. Let |writePosition| be |options|["{{FileSystemReadWriteOptions/at}}"] if
   |options|["{{FileSystemReadWriteOptions/at}}"] [=map/exists=]; otherwise
   [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=].
1. If the underlying file system does not support writing to a file offset of
   |writePosition|, [=throw=] a {{TypeError}}.
1. Let |fileContents| be a copy of [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. Let |oldSize| be |fileContents|'s [=byte sequence/length=].
1. Let |bufferSize| be |buffer|'s [=byte length=].
1. If |writePosition| is larger than |oldSize|,
   append |writePosition| &minus; |oldSize| 0x00 (NUL) bytes to the end of |fileContents|.

   Note: Implementations are expected to behave as if the skipped over file contents
   are indeed filled with NUL bytes. That doesn't mean these bytes have to actually be
   written to disk and take up disk space. Instead most file systems support so called
   sparse files, where these NUL bytes don't take up actual disk space.

1. Let |head| be a [=byte sequence=] containing the first |writePosition| bytes of |fileContents|.
1. Let |tail| be an empty [=byte sequence=].
1. If |writePosition| + |bufferSize| is smaller than |oldSize|:
   1. Set |tail| to a [=byte sequence=] containing the last
      |oldSize| &minus; (|writePosition| + |bufferSize|) bytes of |fileContents|.
1. Let |newSize| be |head|'s [=byte sequence/length=] + |bufferSize| + |tail|'s [=byte sequence/length=].
1. If |newSize| &minus; |oldSize| exceeds the available [=storage quota=],
   [=throw=] a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Set [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=] to the concatenation of |head|, the contents of |buffer| and |tail|.

  Note: The mechanism used to access buffer's contents is left purposely vague.
  It is likely that implementations will choose to focus on performance by issuing
  direct write calls to the host operating system (instead of creating a copy of buffer),
  which prevents a detailed specification of the write order and the results of partial writes.

1. If the operations modifying the [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=] in the previous steps
   failed:
    1. If there were partial writes and the number of bytes that were written from |buffer| is known:
        1. Let |bytesWritten| be the number of bytes that were written from |buffer|.
        1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |writePosition| + |bytesWritten|.
        1. Return |bytesWritten|.
    1. Otherwise [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |writePosition| + |bufferSize|.
1. Return |bufferSize|.

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/truncate()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-truncate}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/truncate()|truncate}}(|newSize|)
  :: Resizes the file associated with |handle| to be |newSize| bytes long. If |newSize| is larger than the current file size this pads the file with null bytes; otherwise it truncates the file.

  :: The file cursor is updated when {{truncate}} is called. If the cursor is smaller than |newSize|, it remains unchanged. If the cursor is larger than |newSize|, it is set to |newSize|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>truncate(|newSize|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=].[=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
   {{DOMException}}.
1. Let |fileContents| be a copy of [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. 1. Let |oldSize| be the [=byte sequence/length=] of [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. If the underlying file system does not support setting a file's size to
   |newSize|, [=throw=] a {{TypeError}}.
1. If |newSize| is larger than |oldSize|:
   1. If |newSize| &minus; |oldSize| exceeds the available [=storage quota=],
      [=throw=] a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}}.
   1. Set [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s to a [=byte sequence=] formed by concatenating
      |fileContents| with a [=byte sequence=]
      containing |newSize| &minus; |oldSize| 0x00 bytes.
   1. If the operations modifying the [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=] in the previous steps
      failed, [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Otherwise, if |newSize| is smaller than |oldSize|:
   1. Set [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s to a [=byte sequence=] containing the first |newSize| bytes
      in |fileContents|.
   1. If the operations modifying the [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=] in the previous steps
      failed, [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. If [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] is greater than |newSize|, then set [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |newSize|.

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/getSize()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-getsize}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/getSize()}}
  :: Returns the size of the file associated with |handle| in bytes.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>getSize()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=].[=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
   {{DOMException}}.
1. Return [=this=].[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=]'s [=byte sequence/length=].

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-flush}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}}
  :: Ensures that the contents of the file associated with |handle| contain all the modifications done through {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/write()}}.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>flush()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=].[=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
   {{DOMException}}.
1. Attempt to transfer all cached modifications of the file's content to the
   file system's underlying storage device.

   Note: This is also known as flushing. This may be a no-op on some file
   systems, such as in-memory file systems, which do not have a "disk" to flush
   to.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/close()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-close}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/close()}}
  :: Closes the access handle or no-ops if the access handle is already closed.
     This disables any further operations on it and
     [=file entry/lock/release|releases the lock=] on the
     [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] associated with |handle|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>close()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", return.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] to "`closed`".
1. [=file entry/lock/release|Release the lock=] on
   [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=].

Note: This method does not guarantee that all file modifications will be
immediately reflected in the underlying storage device. Call the
{{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}} method first if you require this
guarantee.

# Accessing the Origin Private File System # {#sandboxed-filesystem}

The <dfn export>origin private file system</dfn> is a [=storage endpoint=] whose
<a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">identifier</a> is `"fileSystem"`,
<a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">types</a> are `« "local" »`,
and <a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">quota</a> is null.

Issue: Storage endpoints should be defined in [[storage]] itself, rather
than being defined here. So merge this into the table there.

Note: While user agents will typically implement this by persisting the contents of this
[=origin private file system=] to disk, it is not intended that the contents are easily
user accessible. Similarly there is no expectation that files or directories with names
matching the names of children of the [=origin private file system=] exist.

<xmp class=idl>
[SecureContext]
partial interface StorageManager {
  Promise<FileSystemDirectoryHandle> getDirectory();
};
</xmp>

<div class="note domintro">
  : |directoryHandle| = await navigator . storage . {{StorageManager/getDirectory()}}
  :: Returns the root directory of the origin private file system.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=StorageManager>getDirectory()</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |environment| be the [=current settings object=].

1. Let |map| be the result of running [=obtain a local storage bottle map=]
   with |environment| and `"fileSystem"`. If this returns failure,
   return [=a promise rejected with=] a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. If |map|["root"] does not [=map/exist=]:
  1. Let |dir| be a new [=directory entry=] whose [=query access=] and [=request access=] algorithms
     always return "{{PermissionState/granted}}".
  1. Set |dir|'s [=file system entry/name=] to the empty string.
  1. Set |dir|'s [=directory entry/children=] to an empty [=/set=].
  1. Set |map|["root"] to |dir|.

1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] a new {{FileSystemDirectoryHandle}},
   whose associated [=FileSystemHandle/entry=] is |map|["root"].
