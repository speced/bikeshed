<h2 id=goals class=no-num>Goals</h2>

<ul>
 <li><p>Deduplicate boilerplate in standards.

 <li><p>Align standards on conventions, terminology, and data structures.

 <li><p>Be a place for concepts used by multiple standards without a good home.

 <li><p>Help write clear and readable algorithmic prose by clarifying otherwise ambiguous concepts.
</ul>

<p>Suggestions for more goals welcome.</p>


<h2 id=usage>Usage</h2>

<p>To make use of the Infra Standard in a document titled <var>X</var>, use
<samp><var>X</var> depends on the Infra Standard</samp>. Additionally, cross-referencing terminology
is encouraged to avoid ambiguity.

<p>Specification authors are also encouraged to add their specification to the
<a href=https://github.com/whatwg/infra/wiki/Dependent-specs>list of dependent specifications</a> in
order to help the editors ensure that any future breaking changes to the Infra Standard are
correctly reflected by any such dependencies.


<h2 id=conventions>Conventions</h2>

<h3 id=conformance>Conformance</h3>

<p>All assertions, diagrams, examples, and notes are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly
marked non-normative. Everything else is normative.

<p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119. [[!RFC2119]]

<p>These keywords have equivalent meaning when written in lowercase and cannot appear in
non-normative content.

<p class=note>This is a <a>willful violation</a> of RFC 8174, motivated by legibility and a desire
to preserve long-standing practice in many non-IETF-published pre-RFC 8174 documents. [[RFC8174]]

<p>All of the above is applicable to both this standard and any document that uses this standard.
Documents using this standard are encouraged to limit themselves to "must", "must not", "should",
and "may", and to use these in their lowercase form as that is generally considered to be more
readable.

<p>For non-normative content "strongly encouraged", "strongly discouraged", "encouraged",
"discouraged", "can", "cannot", "could", "could not", "might", and "might not" can be used instead.


<h3 id=other-specs>Compliance with other specifications</h3>

<p>In general, specifications interact with and rely on a wide variety of other specifications. In
certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs require a specification to violate the
requirements of other specifications. When this occurs, a document using the Infra Standard should
denote such transgressions as a <dfn export>willful violation</dfn>, and note the reason for that
violation.

<p class=example id=example-willful-violation>The previous section, [[#conformance]], documents a
<a>willful violation</a> of RFC 8174 committed by the Infra Standard.


<h3 id=terminology>Terminology</h3>

<p>The word "or", in cases where both inclusive "or" and exclusive "or" are possible (e.g., "if
either width or height is zero"), means an inclusive "or" (implying "or both"), unless it is called
out as being exclusive (with "but not both").


<h2 id=algorithms>Algorithms</h2>

<p>Algorithms, and requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any
leading spaces" or "return false") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the keyword (e.g.,
"must") used in introducing the algorithm or step. If no such keyword is used, must is implied.

<div class=example id=example-algorithms>
 <p>For example, were the spec to say:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p class=allow-2119>To eat an orange, the user must:

  <ol class=brief>
   <li>Peel the orange.
   <li>Separate each slice of the orange.
   <li>Eat the orange slices.
  </ol>
 </blockquote>

 <p>it would be equivalent to the following:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>To eat an orange:

  <ol class=brief>
   <li class=allow-2119>The user must peel the orange.
   <li class=allow-2119>The user must separate each slice of the orange.
   <li class=allow-2119>The user must eat the orange slices.
  </ol>
 </blockquote>

 <p class=allow-2119>Here the key word is "must".</p>

 <p class=allow-2119>Modifying the above example, if the algorithm was introduced only with "To eat
 an orange:", it would still have the same meaning, as "must" is implied.
</div>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)

<p class=note>Performance is tricky to get correct as it is influenced by user perception, computer
architectures, and different types of input that can change over time in how common they are. For
instance, a JavaScript engine likely has many different code paths for what is standardized as a
single algorithm, in order to optimize for speed or memory consumption. Standardizing all those code
paths would be an insurmountable task and not productive as they would not stand the test of time
as well as the single algorithm would. Therefore performance is best left as a field to compete
over.


<h3 id=variables>Variables</h3>

<p>A variable is declared with "let" and changed with "set".

<p class=example id=example-variable>Let |list| be a new <a>list</a>.</p>

<div class=example id=example-variable-null>
 <ol>
  <li><p>Let |value| be null.

  <li><p>If |input| is a <a>string</a>, then set |value| to |input|.

  <li><p>Otherwise, set |value| to |input|, <a>UTF-8 decoded</a>.

  <li><p><a>Assert</a>: |value| is a <a>string</a>.
 </ol>
</div>

<p class=example id=example-variable-ternary>Let <var ignore>activationTarget</var> be
<var ignore>target</var> if <var ignore>isActivationEvent</var> is true and target has activation
behavior; otherwise null.

<p>Variables must not be used before they are declared. Variables are
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Block_scope>block scoped</a>.
Variables must not be declared more than once per algorithm.


<h3 id=algorithm-control-flow>Control flow</h3>

<p>The control flow of algorithms is such that a requirement to "return" or "throw" terminates the
algorithm the statement was in. "Return" will hand the given value, if any, to its caller. "Throw"
will make the caller automatically rethrow the given value, if any, and thereby terminate the
caller's algorithm. Using prose the caller has the ability to "catch" the exception and perform
another action.


<h3 id=algorithm-conditional-abort>Conditional abort</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to stop performing a series of steps once a condition becomes true.

<p>To do this, state that a given series of steps will <dfn export>abort when</dfn> a specific
<var>condition</var> is reached. This indicates that the specified steps must be evaluated, not
as-written, but by additionally inserting a step before each of them that evaluates
<var>condition</var>, and if <var>condition</var> evaluates to true, skips the remaining steps.

<p>In such algorithms, the subsequent step can be annotated to run <dfn export>if aborted</dfn>, in
which case it must run if any of the preceding steps were skipped due to the <var>condition</var>
of the preceding <a>abort when</a> step evaluated to true.

<div class=example id=example-conditional-abort>
 <p>The following algorithm

 <ol>
  <li><p>Let |result| be an empty <a>list</a>.

  <li>
   <p>Run these steps, but <a>abort when</a> the user clicks the "Cancel" button:

   <ol>
    <li><p>Compute the first million digits of <var>π</var>, and <a for=list>append</a> the result
    to |result|.

    <li><p>Compute the first million digits of |e|, and <a for=list>append</a> the result to
    |result|.

    <li><p>Compute the first million digits of <var>φ</var>, and <a for=list>append</a> the result
    to |result|.
   </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p><a>If aborted</a>, <a for=list>append</a> "<code>Didn't finish!</code>" to |result|.
 </ol>

 <p>is equivalent to the more verbose formulation</p>

 <ol>
  <li><p>Let |result| be an empty <a>list</a>.

  <li>
   <p>If the user has not clicked the "Cancel" button, then:

   <ol>
    <li><p>Compute the first million digits of <var>π</var>, and <a for=list>append</a> the result
    to |result|.

    <li>
     <p>If the user has not clicked the "Cancel" button, then:

     <ol>
      <li><p>Compute the first million digits of |e|, and <a for=list>append</a> the result to
      |result|.

      <li><p>If the user has not clicked the "Cancel" button, then compute the first million digits
      of <var>φ</var>, and <a for=list>append</a> the result to |result|.
     </ol>
   </ol>

  <li><p>If the user clicked the "Cancel" button, then <a for=list>append</a>
  "<code>Didn't finish!</code>" to |result|.
 </ol>
</div>

<p class=note>Whenever this construct is used, implementations are allowed to evaluate
<var>condition</var> during the specified steps rather than before and after each step, as long as
the end result is indistinguishable. For instance, as long as |result| in the above example is not
mutated during a compute operation, the user agent could stop the computation.


<h3 id=algorithm-iteration>Iteration</h3>

<p>There's a variety of ways to repeat a set of steps until a condition is reached.

<p class=note>The Infra Standard is not (yet) exhaustive on this; please file an issue if you need
something.

<dl>
 <dt>For each
 <dd><p>As defined <a for=list lt="for each">for lists</a> (and derivatives) and
 <a for=map lt="for each">maps</a>.

 <dt><dfn export for=iteration lt=while>While</dfn>
 <dd>
  <p>An instruction to repeat a set of steps as long as a condition is met.

  <div class=example id=example-while>
   <p>While |condition| is "<code>met</code>":

   <ol>
    <li><p>&hellip;
   </ol>
  </div>
</dl>

<p>An iteration's flow can be controlled via requirements to
<dfn export for=iteration>continue</dfn> or <dfn export for=iteration>break</dfn>.
<a for=iteration>Continue</a> will skip over any remaining steps in an iteration, proceeding to the
next item. If no further items remain, the iteration will stop. <a for=iteration>Break</a> will skip
over any remaining steps in an iteration, and skip over any remaining items as well, stopping the
iteration.

<div class=example id=example-break-continue>
 <p>Let |example| be the <a>list</a> « 1, 2, 3, 4 ». The following prose would perform |operation|
 upon 1, then 2, then 3, then 4:

 <ol>
  <li>
   <p><a for=list>For each</a> |item| of |example|:
   <ol>
    <li>Perform |operation| on |item|.
   </ol>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>The following prose would perform |operation| upon 1, then 2, then 4. 3 would be skipped.

 <ol>
  <li>
   <p><a for=list>For each</a> |item| of |example|:
   <ol>
    <li>If |item| is 3, then <a for=iteration>continue</a>.
    <li>Perform |operation| on |item|.
   </ol>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>The following prose would perform |operation| upon 1, then 2. 3 and 4 would be skipped.

 <ol>
  <li>
   <p><a for=list>For each</a> |item| of |example|:
   <ol>
    <li>If |item| is 3, then <a for=iteration>break</a>.
    <li>Perform |operation| on |item|.
   </ol>
  </li>
 </ol>
</div>


<h3 id=assertions>Assertions</h3>

<p>To improve readability, it can sometimes help to add assertions to algorithms, stating
invariants. To do this, write "<dfn export>Assert</dfn>:", followed by a statement that must be
true. If the statement ends up being false that indicates an issue with the document using the Infra
Standard that should be reported and addressed.

<p class=note>Since the statement can only ever be true, it has no implications for implementations.

<div class=example id=example-assert>
 <ol>
  <li><p>Let |x| be "<code>Aperture Science</code>".
  <li><p><a>Assert</a>: |x| is "<code>Aperture Science</code>".
</div>


<h2 id=primitive-data-types>Primitive data types</h2>

<h3 id=nulls>Nulls</h3>

<p>The value null is used to indicate the lack of a value. It can be used interchangeably with the
JavaScript <b>null</b> value. [[!ECMA-262]]

<p class=example id=example-null>Let <var ignore>element</var> be null.

<p class=example id=example-null-return>If <var>input</var> is the empty string, then return null.


<h3 id=booleans>Booleans</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>boolean</dfn> is either true or false.

<p class=example id=example-boolean>Let <var ignore>elementSeen</var> be false.


<h3 id=bytes>Bytes</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>byte</dfn> is a sequence of eight bits, represented as a double-digit hexadecimal
number in the range 0x00 to 0xFF, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII byte</dfn> is a <a>byte</a> in the range 0x00 (NUL) to 0x7F (DEL),
inclusive. As illustrated, an <a>ASCII byte</a>, excluding 0x28 and 0x29, may be followed by the
representation outlined in the <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20#section-2>Standard Code</a>
section of <cite>ASCII format for Network Interchange</cite>, between parentheses. [[!RFC20]]

<p>0x28 may be followed by "(left parenthesis)" and 0x29 by "(right parenthesis)".

<p class=example id=example-byte-notation>0x49 (I) when <a>UTF-8 decoded</a> becomes the
<a>code point</a> U+0049 (I).


<h3 id=byte-sequences>Byte sequences</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>byte sequence</dfn> is a sequence of <a>bytes</a>, represented as a space-separated
sequence of bytes. Byte sequences with bytes in the range 0x20 (SP) to 0x7E (~), inclusive, can
alternately be written as a string, but using backticks instead of quotation marks, to avoid
confusion with an actual <a>string</a>.

<div class=example id=example-byte-sequence-notation>
 <p>0x48 0x49 can also be represented as `<code>HI</code>`.

 <p>Headers, such as `<code>Content-Type</code>`, are <a>byte sequences</a>.
</div>

<p class=note>To get a <a>byte sequence</a> out of a <a>string</a>, using <a>UTF-8 encode</a> from
the Encoding Standard is encouraged. In rare circumstances <a>isomorphic encode</a> might be needed.
[[ENCODING]]

<p>A <a>byte sequence</a>'s <dfn export for="byte sequence">length</dfn> is the number of
<a>bytes</a> it contains.

<p>To <dfn export>byte-lowercase</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a>, increase each <a>byte</a> it
contains, in the range 0x41 (A) to 0x5A (Z), inclusive, by 0x20.

<p>To <dfn export>byte-uppercase</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a>, subtract each <a>byte</a> it
contains, in the range 0x61 (a) to 0x7A (z), inclusive, by 0x20.

<p>A <a>byte sequence</a> <var>A</var> is a <dfn export>byte-case-insensitive</dfn> match for a
<a>byte sequence</a> <var>B</var>, if the <a>byte-lowercase</a> of <var>A</var> is the
<a>byte-lowercase</a> of <var>B</var>.

<hr>

<p>A <a>byte sequence</a> <var>a</var> <dfn export for="byte sequence">starts with</dfn> a
<a>byte sequence</a> <var>b</var> if the following steps return true:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>i</var> be 0.

 <li>
  <p><a>While</a> true:

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>aByte</var> be the <var>i</var>th <a>byte</a> of <var>a</var> if <var>i</var> is
   less than <var>a</var>'s <a for="byte sequence">length</a>; otherwise null.

   <li><p>Let <var>bByte</var> be the <var>i</var>th <a>byte</a> of <var>b</var> if <var>i</var> is
   less than <var>b</var>'s <a for="byte sequence">length</a>; otherwise null.

   <li><p>If <var>bByte</var> is null, then return true.

   <li><p>Return false if <var>aByte</var> is not <var>bByte</var>.

   <li><p>Set <var>i</var> to <var>i</var> + 1.
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>A <a>byte sequence</a> <var>a</var> is <dfn export>byte less than</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a>
<var>b</var> if the following steps return true:

<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>b</var> <a for="byte sequence">starts with</a> <var>a</var>, then return false.

 <li><p>If <var>a</var> <a for="byte sequence">starts with</a> <var>b</var>, then return true.

 <li><p>Let <var>n</var> be the smallest index such that the <var>n</var>th <a>byte</a> of
 <var>a</var> is different from the <var>n</var>th byte of <var>b</var>. (There has to be such an
 index, since neither byte sequence starts with the other.)

 <li><p>If the <var>n</var>th byte of <var>a</var> is less than the <var>n</var>th byte of
 <var>b</var>, then return true.

 <li><p>Return false.
</ol>

<hr>

<p>To <dfn export>isomorphic decode</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a> <var>input</var>, return a
<a>string</a> whose <a for=string>length</a> is equal to <var>input</var>'s
<a for="byte sequence">length</a> and whose <a>code points</a> have the same values as
<var>input</var>'s <a>bytes</a>, in the same order.


<h3 id=code-points>Code points</h3>

<p>A <dfn export lt="code point|character">code point</dfn> is a Unicode code point and is
represented as a four-to-six digit hexadecimal number, typically prefixed with "U+".

<p>A <a>code point</a> may be followed by its name, by its rendered form between parentheses when it
is not U+0028 or U+0029, or by both. Documents using the Infra Standard are encouraged to follow
<a>code points</a> by their name when they cannot be rendered or are U+0028 or U+0029; otherwise,
follow them by their rendered form between parentheses, for legibility.

<p>A <a>code point</a>'s name is defined in the Unicode Standard and represented in
<a>ASCII uppercase</a>. [[!UNICODE]]

<div class=example id=example-code-point-notation>
 <p>The <a>code point</a> rendered as 🤔 is represented as U+1F914.

 <p>When referring to that <a>code point</a>, we might say "U+1F914 (🤔)", to provide extra context.
 Documents are allowed to use "U+1F914 THINKING FACE (🤔)" as well, though this is somewhat verbose.
</div>

<p class=example id=example-code-point-notation-hard-to-render><a>Code points</a> that are difficult
to render unambigiously, such as U+000A, can be referred to as "U+000A LF". U+0029 can be referred
to as "U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS", because even though it renders, this avoids unmatched parentheses.

<p><a>Code points</a> are sometimes referred to as <a>characters</a> and in certain contexts are
prefixed with "0x" rather than "U+".

<p>A <dfn export>surrogate</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> that is in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF,
inclusive.

<p>A <dfn export>scalar value</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> that is not a <a>surrogate</a>.

<p>A <dfn export>noncharacter</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> that is in the range U+FDD0 to U+FDEF,
inclusive, or U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, U+2FFFE, U+2FFFF, U+3FFFE, U+3FFFF, U+4FFFE,
U+4FFFF, U+5FFFE, U+5FFFF, U+6FFFE, U+6FFFF, U+7FFFE, U+7FFFF, U+8FFFE, U+8FFFF, U+9FFFE, U+9FFFF,
U+AFFFE, U+AFFFF, U+BFFFE, U+BFFFF, U+CFFFE, U+CFFFF, U+DFFFE, U+DFFFF, U+EFFFE, U+EFFFF, U+FFFFE,
U+FFFFF, U+10FFFE, or U+10FFFF.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII code point</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0000 NULL to
U+007F DELETE, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export lt="ASCII tab or newline|ASCII tabs or newlines">ASCII tab or newline</dfn> is
U+0009 TAB, U+000A LF, or U+000D CR.

<p><dfn export>ASCII whitespace</dfn> is U+0009 TAB, U+000A LF, U+000C FF, U+000D CR, or U+0020
SPACE.

<p class=note>"Whitespace" is a mass noun.

<p>A <dfn export>C0 control</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0000 NULL to
U+001F INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE, inclusive.

<p>A <dfn export lt="C0 control or space|C0 controls or spaces">C0 control or space</dfn> is a
<a>C0 control</a> or U+0020 SPACE.

<p>A <dfn export>control</dfn> is a <a>C0 control</a> or a <a>code point</a> in the range
U+007F DELETE to U+009F APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII digit</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9),
inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII upper hex digit</dfn> is an <a>ASCII digit</a> or a <a>code point</a> in the
range U+0041 (A) to U+0046 (F), inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII lower hex digit</dfn> is an <a>ASCII digit</a> or a <a>code point</a> in the
range U+0061 (a) to U+0066 (f), inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII hex digit</dfn> is an <a>ASCII upper hex digit</a> or
<a>ASCII lower hex digit</a>.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII upper alpha</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0041 (A) to
U+005A (Z), inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII lower alpha</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0061 (a) to
U+007A (z), inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alpha</dfn> is an <a>ASCII upper alpha</a> or <a>ASCII lower alpha</a>.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alphanumeric</dfn> is an <a>ASCII digit</a> or <a>ASCII alpha</a>.


<h3 id=strings>Strings</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>JavaScript string</dfn> is a sequence of unsigned 16-bit integers, also known as
<dfn export lt="code unit">code units</dfn>.

<p class=note>This is different from how the Unicode Standard defines "code unit". In particular it
refers exclusively to how the Unicode Standard defines it for Unicode 16-bit strings. [[UNICODE]]

<p>A <a>JavaScript string</a>'s <dfn export for="JavaScript string">length</dfn> is the number of
<a>code units</a> it contains.

<p>A <a>JavaScript string</a> can also be interpreted as containing <a>code points</a>, per the
conversion defined in <a>The String Type</a> section of the JavaScript specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

<p class=note>This conversion process converts surrogate pairs into their corresponding
<a>scalar value</a> and maps isolated surrogates to their corresponding <a>code point</a>, leaving
them effectively as-is.

<p class=example id=example-javascript-string-in-code-points>A <a>JavaScript string</a> consisting
of the <a>code units</a> 0xD83D, 0xDCA9, and 0xD800, when interpreted as containing
<a>code points</a>, would consist of the <a>code points</a> U+1F4A9 and U+D800.

<p>A <dfn export>scalar value string</dfn> is a sequence of <a>scalar values</a>.

<p class=note>A <a>scalar value string</a> is useful for any kind of I/O or other kind of operation
where <a>UTF-8 encode</a> comes into play.
<!-- It's also useful if you can imagine the subsystem to be implemented in Rust -->

<p><dfn export lt=string>String</dfn> can be used to refer to either a <a>JavaScript string</a> or
<a>scalar value string</a>, when it is clear from the context which is meant or when the distinction
is immaterial. <a>Strings</a> are denoted by double quotes and monospace font.

<p class=example id=example-string-notation>"<code>Hello, world!</code>" is a string.

<p>A <a>string</a>'s <dfn export for=string>length</dfn> is the number of <a>code points</a> it
contains.

<p>To <dfn export for="JavaScript string">convert</dfn> a <a>JavaScript string</a> into a
<a>scalar value string</a>, replace any <a>surrogates</a> with U+FFFD.
<!-- Obviates need for https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-obtain-unicode -->

<p class=note>The replaced surrogates are always isolated surrogates, since the process of
interpreting the JavaScript string as containing <a>code points</a> will have converted surrogate
pairs into <a>scalar values</a>.

<p>A <a>scalar value string</a> can always be used as <a>JavaScript string</a> implicitly since it
is a subset. The reverse is only possible if the <a>JavaScript string</a> is known to not contain
<a>surrogates</a>; otherwise a <a for="JavaScript string" lt=convert>conversion</a> must be
performed.

<p class=note>An implementation likely has to perform explicit conversion, depending on how it
actually ends up representing <a lt="JavaScript string">JavaScript</a> and
<a>scalar value strings</a>. It is even fairly typical for implementations to have multiple
implementations of just <a>JavaScript strings</a> for performance and memory reasons.

<h2 id=data-structures>Data structures</h2>

<p>Conventionally, specifications have operated on a variety of vague specification-level data
structures, based on shared understanding of their semantics. This generally works well, but can
lead to ambiguities around edge cases, such as iteration order or what happens when you
<a for=set>append</a> an <a for=set>item</a> to an <a>ordered set</a> that the set already
<a for=set>contains</a>. It has also led to a variety of divergent notation and phrasing, especially
around more complex data structures such as <a lt="ordered map">maps</a>.

<p>This standard provides a small set of common data structures, along with notation and phrasing
for working with them, in order to create common ground.


<h3 id=lists>Lists</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>list</dfn> is a specification type consisting of a finite ordered sequence of
<dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set lt=item>items</dfn>.

<p>For notational convenience, a literal syntax can be used to express <a>lists</a>, by surrounding
the list by « » characters and separating its <a for=list>items</a> with a comma. An indexing syntax
can be used by providing a zero-based index into a list inside square brackets. The index cannot be
out-of-bounds, except when used with <a for=list>exists</a>.

<p class=example id=example-list-notation>Let |example| be the <a>list</a> « "<code>a</code>",
"<code>b</code>", "<code>c</code>", "<code>a</code>" ». Then |example|[1] is the <a>string</a>
"<code>b</code>".

<p>To <dfn export for=list>append</dfn> to a <a>list</a> that is not an <a>ordered set</a> is to
add the given <a for=list>item</a> to the end of the list.

<p>To <dfn export for=list>extend</dfn> a <a>list</a> |A| with a <a>list</a> |B|,
<a for=list>for each</a> |item| of |B|, <a for=list>append</a> |item| to |A|.

<div class=example id=example-list-extend>

  <li><p><a>Assert</a>: |ghostbusters|[2] is "<code>Jillian Holtzmann</code>".
 </ol>
</div>

<p>To <dfn export for=list>prepend</dfn> to a <a>list</a> that is not an <a>ordered set</a> is to
add the given <a for=list>item</a> to the beginning of the list.

<p>To <dfn export for=list>replace</dfn> within a <a>list</a> that is not an <a>ordered set</a> is
to replace all items from the list that match a given condition with the given <a for=list>item</a>,
or do nothing if none do.

<p class=note>The above definitions are modified when the <a>list</a> is an <a>ordered set</a>; see
below for <a for=set lt=append>ordered set append</a>, <a for=set>prepend</a>, and
<a for=set>replace</a>.

<p>To <dfn export for=list,set>insert</dfn> an <a for=list>item</a> into a <a>list</a> before an
index is to add the given item to the list between the given index &minus; 1 and the given index. If
the given index is 0, then <a for=list>prepend</a> the given item to the list.

<p>To <dfn export for=list,set>remove</dfn> zero or more <a for=list>items</a> from a <a>list</a> is
to remove all items from the list that match a given condition, or do nothing if none do.

<div class=example id=example-list-remove>
 <p><a for=list>Removing</a> |x| from the <a>list</a> « |x|, |y|, |z|, |x| » is to remove all

 <p><a for=list>Removing</a> all items that start with the <a>string</a> "<code>a</code>" from the

<p>A <a>list</a> <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set lt=contain|exist>contains</dfn> an
<a for=list>item</a> if it appears in the list. We can also denote this by saying that, for a
<a>list</a> |list| and an index |index|, "|list|[|index|] <a for=list>exists</a>".

<p>A <a>list</a>'s <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set>size</dfn> is the number of
<a for=list>items</a> the list <a for=list>contains</a>.

<p>A <a>list</a> <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set lt="is empty|is not empty">is empty</dfn> if

subsequent prose.

<p>To <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set>clone</dfn> a <a>list</a> |list| is to create a new
<a>list</a> |clone|, of the same designation, and, <a for=list>for each</a> |item| of |list|,
<a for=list>append</a> |item| to |clone|, so that |clone| <a for=list>contains</a> the same
<a for=list>items</a>, in the same order as |list|.

<p class=note>This is a "shallow clone", as the <a for=list>items</a> themselves are not cloned in

<p>To <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set lt="sort in ascending order|sorting in ascending order|sort|sorting">sort in ascending order</dfn>
a <a>list</a> |list|, with a less than algorithm |lessThanAlgo|, is to create a new <a>list</a>

|lessThanAlgo|, each item is less than the one following it, if any. For items that sort the same
(i.e., for which |lessThanAlgo| returns false for both comparisons), their relative order in
|sorted| must be the same as it was in |list|.

<p>To <dfn export for=list,stack,queue,set lt="sort in descending order|sorting in descending order">sort in descending order</dfn>
a <a>list</a> |list|, with a less than algorithm |lessThanAlgo|, is to create a new <a>list</a>

<h4 id=stacks>Stacks</h4>

<p>Some <a>lists</a> are designated as <dfn export lt=stack>stacks</dfn>. A stack is a <a>list</a>,

<p>Although <a>queues</a> are <a>lists</a>, <a for=list>for each</a> must not be used with them;

<h4 id=sets>Sets</h4>

<p>Some <a>lists</a> are designated as <dfn export lt="ordered set|set">ordered sets</dfn>. An

<p class=note>Almost all cases on the web platform require an <em>ordered</em> set, instead of an
unordered one, since interoperability requires that any developer-exposed enumeration of the set's

<p>An <a>ordered set</a> |set| is a <dfn export for=set>subset</dfn> of another <a>ordered set</a>

<p class=note>This implies that an <a>ordered set</a> is both a <a for=set>subset</a> and a

<p>The <dfn export for=set>intersection</dfn> of <a>ordered sets</a> |A| and |B|, is the result

<h3 id=maps>Maps</h3>

<p>An <dfn export lt="ordered map|map">ordered map</dfn>, or sometimes just "map", is a
specification type consisting of a finite ordered sequence of
<dfn for=map export>key</dfn>/<dfn for=map export>value</dfn> pairs, with no key appearing twice.
Each key/value pair is called an <dfn for=map export>entry</dfn>.

<p class=note>As with <a>ordered sets</a>, by default we assume that maps need to be ordered for
interoperability among implementations.

<p>A literal syntax can be used to express <a>ordered maps</a>, by surrounding the ordered map with
«[ ]» characters, denoting each of its <a for=map>entries</a> as |key| → |value|, and separating its
entries with a comma. An indexing syntax can be used to look up and set <a for=map>values</a> by
providing a <a for=map>key</a> inside square brackets. The index cannot be out-of-bounds, except
when used with <a for=map>exists</a>.

<p class=example id=example-map-notation>Let |example| be the <a>ordered map</a> «[
"<code>a</code>" → `<code>x</code>`, "<code>b</code>" → `<code>y</code>` ]». Then
|example|["<code>a</code>"] is the <a>byte sequence</a> `<code>x</code>`.

<hr>

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="get|get the value">get the value of an entry</dfn> in an
<a>ordered map</a> given a <a for=map>key</a>, return the <a for=map>value</a> of the
<a for=map>entry</a> whose <a for=map>key</a> is the given key. We can also use the indexing syntax
explained above.

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="set|set the value">set the value of an entry</dfn> in an
<a>ordered map</a> to a given <a for=map>value</a> is to update the value of any existing
<a for=map>entry</a> if the map <a for=map>contains</a> an entry with the given <a for=map>key</a>,
or if none such exists, to add a new entry with the given key/value to the end of the map. We can
also denote this by saying, for an <a>ordered map</a> |map|, key |key|, and value |value|,
"<a for=map>set</a> |map|[|key|] to |value|".

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt=remove>remove an entry</dfn> from an <a>ordered map</a> is to remove
all <a for=map>entries</a> from the map that match a given condition, or do nothing if none do. If
the condition is having a certain <a for=map>key</a>, then we can also denote this by saying, for
an <a>ordered map</a> |map| and key |key|, "<a for=map>remove</a> |map|[|key|]".

<p>An <a>ordered map</a> <dfn export for=map lt=exist|contain id=map-exists>contains an
<a for=map>entry</a> with a given key</dfn> if there exists an entry with that <a for=map>key</a>.
We can also denote this by saying that, for an <a>ordered map</a> |map| and key |key|, "|map|[|key|]
<a for=map>exists</a>".

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="getting the keys|get the keys">get the keys</dfn> of an
<a>ordered map</a>, return a new <a>ordered set</a> whose <a for=set>items</a> are each of the
<a for=map>keys</a> in the map's <a for=map>entries</a>.

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="getting the values|get the values">get the values</dfn> of an
<a>ordered map</a>, return a new <a>list</a> whose <a for=list>items</a> are each of the
<a for=map>values</a> in the map's <a for=map>entries</a>.

<p>An <a>ordered map</a>'s <dfn export for=map>size</dfn> is the <a for=set>size</a> of the result
of running <a for=map>get the keys</a> on the map.

<p>An <a>ordered map</a> <dfn export for=map lt="is empty|is not empty">is empty</dfn> if its
<a for=map>size</a> is zero.

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="iterate|for each">iterate</dfn> over an <a>ordered map</a>, performing
a set of steps on each <a for=map>entry</a> in order, use phrasing of the form
"<a for=map>For each</a> |key| → |value| of |map|", and then operate on |key| and |value| in the
subsequent prose.

<p>To <dfn export for=map>clone</dfn> an <a>ordered map</a> |map| is to create a new
<a>ordered map</a> |clone|, and, <a for=map>for each</a> |key| → |value| of |map|,
<a for=map>set</a> |clone|[|key|] to |value|.

<p class=note>This is a "shallow clone", as the <a for=map>keys</a> and <a for=map>values</a>
themselves are not cloned in any way.

<p class=example id=example-map-clone>Let |original| be the <a>ordered map</a> «[
"<code>a</code>" → «1, 2, 3», "<code>b</code>" → «» ]». <a for=set>Cloning</a> |original| creates a
new <a>ordered map</a> |clone|, so that <a for=map>setting</a> |clone|["<code>a</code>"] to
«-1, -2, -3» gives «[ "<code>a</code>" → «-1, -2, -3», "<code>b</code>" → «» ]» and leaves
|original| unchanged. However, <a for=list>appending</a> 4 to |clone|["<code>b</code>"] will modify
the corresponding <a for=map>value</a> in both |clone| and |original|, as they both point to the
same <a>list</a>.

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="sort in ascending order|sorting in ascending order|sort|sorting">sort in ascending order</dfn>
a <a>map</a> |map|, with a less than algorithm |lessThanAlgo|, is to create a new <a>map</a>
|sorted|, containing the same <a for=map>entries</a> as |map| but sorted so that according to
|lessThanAlgo|, each entry is less than the one following it, if any. For entries that sort the same
(i.e., for which |lessThanAlgo| returns false for both comparisons), their relative order in
|sorted| must be the same as it was in |map|.

<p>To <dfn export for=map lt="sort in descending order|sorting in descending order">sort in descending order</dfn>
a <a>map</a> |map|, with a less than algorithm |lessThanAlgo|, is to create a new <a>map</a>
|sorted|, containing the same <a for=map>entries</a> as |map| but sorted so that according to
|lessThanAlgo|, each entry is less than the one preceding it, if any. For entries that sort the same
(i.e., for which |lessThanAlgo| returns false for both comparisons), their relative order in
|sorted| must be the same as it was in |map|.


<h3 id=structs>Structs</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>struct</dfn> is a specification type consisting of a finite set of
<dfn export for=struct,tuple,pair lt=item>items</dfn>, each of which has a unique and immutable
<dfn export for=struct,tuple,pair>name</dfn>.

<hr>

<p><a>Structs</a> with a defined order are also known as <dfn export lt=tuple>tuples</dfn>. For
notational convenience, a literal syntax can be used to express <a>tuples</a>, by surrounding the
tuple with parenthesis and separating its <a for=tuple>items</a> with a comma. To use this notation,
the <a for=tuple>names</a> need to be clear from context. This can be done by preceding the first
instance with the name given to the <a>tuple</a>.

<div class=example id=example-tuple>
 <!-- If https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/issues/960 gets fixed we can show how to use <dfn>
 and <a> on these -->
 <p>A status is an example <a>tuple</a> consisting of a code (a three-digit number) and text (a byte
 sequence).

 <p>A nonsense algorithm that manipulates status tuples for the purpose of demonstrating their
 usage is then:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>Let |statusInstance| be the status (200, `<code>OK</code>`).
  <li>Set |statusInstance| to (301, `<code>FOO BAR</code>`).
  <li>If |statusInstance|'s code is 404, then &hellip;
 </ol>
</div>

<p class=note>It is intentional that not all <a>structs</a> are <a>tuples</a>. Documents using the
Infra Standard might need the flexibility to add new <a for=struct>names</a> to their struct
without breaking literal syntax used by their dependencies. In that case a tuple is not appropriate.

<hr>

<p><a>Tuples</a> with two <a for=tuple>items</a> are also known as <dfn export lt=pair>pairs</dfn>.
For <a>pairs</a>, a slightly shorter literal syntax can be used, separating the two
<a for=pair>items</a> with a / character.

<p class=example id=example-pair>Another way of expressing our |statusInstance| tuple above would be
as 200/`<code>OK</code>`.


<h2 id=json>JSON</h2>

<p class=note>The conventions used in the algorithms in this section are those of the JavaScript
specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

<p>To <dfn export>parse JSON from bytes</dfn> given <var>bytes</var>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>jsonText</var> be the result of running <a>UTF-8 decode</a> on <var>bytes</var>.
 [[!ENCODING]]

 <li><p>Return ? <a abstract-op>Call</a>(<a>%JSONParse%</a>, undefined, « <var>jsonText</var> »).
</ol>

<p>To <dfn export>serialize JSON to bytes</dfn> a given JavaScript value <var>value</var>, run these
steps:

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>Let <var>jsonString</var> be
  ? <a abstract-op>Call</a>(<a>%JSONStringify%</a>, undefined, « <var>value</var> »).

  <p class=note>Since no additional arguments are passed to <a>%JSONStringify%</a>, the resulting
  string will have no whitespace inserted.

 <li><p>Return the result of running <a>UTF-8 encode</a> on <var>jsonString</var>. [[!ENCODING]]
</ol>

<hr>

<p>The above two operations operate on JavaScript values directly; in particular, this means that
the involved objects or arrays are tied to a particular <a lt="realm">JavaScript realm</a>. In
standards, it is often more convenient to parse JSON into realm-independent <a>maps</a>,
<a>lists</a>, <a>strings</a>, <a>booleans</a>, numbers, and nulls.
