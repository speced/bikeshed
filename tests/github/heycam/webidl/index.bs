Abstract: This document defines an interface definition language, Web IDL,
Abstract: that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be
Abstract: implemented in web browsers. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a
Abstract: number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in
Abstract: the web platform to be specified more readily. How interfaces
Abstract: described with Web IDL correspond to constructs within ECMAScript
Abstract: execution environments is also detailed in this document.
Abstract: It is expected that this document acts
Abstract: as a guide to implementors of already-published specifications,
Abstract: and that newly published specifications reference this
Abstract: document to ensure conforming implementations of interfaces
Abstract: are interoperable.
Boilerplate: omit issues-index, omit conformance, omit feedback-header

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<i>This section is informative.</i>

Technical reports published by the W3C that include programming
language interfaces have typically been described using the
Object Management Group’s Interface Definition Language (IDL)
[[OMGIDL]].  The IDL provides a means to
describe these interfaces in a language independent manner.  Usually,
additional language binding appendices are included in such
documents which detail how the interfaces described with the IDL
correspond to constructs in the given language.

However, the bindings in these specifications for the language most
commonly used on the web, ECMAScript, are consistently specified with
low enough precision as to result in interoperability issues.  In
addition, each specification must describe the same basic information,
such as DOM interfaces described in IDL corresponding to properties
on the ECMAScript global object, or the {{unsigned long}} IDL type mapping to the Number
type in ECMAScript.

This specification defines an IDL language similar to OMG IDL
for use by specifications that define interfaces for Web APIs.  A number of extensions are
given to the IDL to support common functionality that previously must
have been written in prose.  In addition, precise language bindings
for the ECMAScript language are given.


<h2 id="idl">Interface definition language</h2>

This section describes a language, <em>Web IDL</em>, which can be used to define
interfaces for APIs in the Web platform.  A specification that defines Web APIs
can include one or more <dfn id="dfn-idl-fragment" export lt="IDL fragment">IDL fragments</dfn> that
describe the interfaces (the state and behavior that objects can exhibit)
for the APIs defined by that specification.
An [=IDL fragment=] is
a sequence of definitions that matches the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Definitions">Definitions</a></emu-nt> grammar symbol.
The set of [=IDL fragments=] that
an implementation supports is not ordered.
See [[#idl-grammar]] for the complete grammar and an explanation of the notation used.

The different kinds of <dfn id="dfn-definition">definitions</dfn> that can appear in an
[=IDL fragment=] are:
[=interfaces=],
[=partial interface|partial interface definitions=],
[=interface mixins=],
[=partial interface mixin|partial mixin definitions=],
[=callback functions=],
[=callback interfaces=],
[=namespaces=],
[=partial namespace|partial namespace definitions=],
[=dictionary|dictionaries=],
[=partial dictionary|partial dictionary definitions=],
[=typedefs=] and
[=includes statements=].
These are all defined in the following sections.

Each [=definition=]
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Definition">Definition</a></emu-nt>)
can be preceded by a list of [=extended attributes=] (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-ExtendedAttributeList">ExtendedAttributeList</a></emu-nt>),
which can control how the definition will be handled in language bindings.
The extended attributes defined by this specification that are language binding
agnostic are discussed in [[#idl-extended-attributes]],
while those specific to the ECMAScript language binding are discussed
in [[#es-extended-attributes]].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">

      /* interface_members... */
    };

</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following is an example of an [=IDL fragment=].

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Paint { };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface SolidColor : Paint {
          attribute double red;
          attribute double green;
          attribute double blue;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Pattern : Paint {
          attribute DOMString imageURL;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface GraphicalWindow {
          constructor();
          readonly attribute unsigned long width;
          readonly attribute unsigned long height;

          attribute Paint currentPaint;

          undefined drawRectangle(double x, double y, double width, double height);

          undefined drawText(double x, double y, DOMString text);
        };
    </pre>

    Here, four [=interfaces=]
    are being defined.
    The <code class="idl">GraphicalWindow</code> interface has two
    [=read only=] [=attributes=],
    one writable attribute, and two [=operations=]
    defined on it.  Objects that implement the <code class="idl">GraphicalWindow</code> interface
    will expose these attributes and operations in a manner appropriate to the
    particular language being used.

    In ECMAScript, the attributes on the IDL interfaces will be exposed as accessor
    properties and the operations as data properties whose value is a [=built-in function object=] on a
    prototype object for all <code class="idl">GraphicalWindow</code>
    objects; each ECMAScript object that implements <code class="idl">GraphicalWindow</code>
    will have that prototype object in its prototype chain.

    The [=constructor operation=] that appears on <code class="idl">GraphicalWindow</code>
    causes a [=constructor=] to exist in ECMAScript implementations,
    so that calling <code>new GraphicalWindow()</code> would return a new object
    that implemented the interface.

    All [=interfaces=] have the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=], which ensures the interfaces
    are only available in [=Realms=] whose [=Realm/global object=] is a {{Window}} object.
</div>


<h3 id="idl-names">Names</h3>

Every [=interface=],
[=partial interface|partial interface definition=],
[=namespace=],
[=partial namespace|partial namespace definition=],
[=dictionary=],
[=partial dictionary|partial dictionary definition=],
[=enumeration=],
[=callback function=],
[=callback interface=] and
[=typedef=] (together called <dfn id="dfn-named-definition" export lt="named definition">named definitions</dfn>)
and every [=constant=],
[=attribute=],
and [=dictionary member=] has an
<dfn id="dfn-identifier" export>identifier</dfn>, as do some
[=operations=].
The identifier is determined by an
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token somewhere
in the declaration:

*   For [=named definitions=],
    the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token that appears
    directly after the <emu-t>interface</emu-t>, <emu-t>namespace</emu-t>,
    <emu-t>dictionary</emu-t>, <emu-t>enum</emu-t>
    or <emu-t>callback</emu-t> keyword
    determines the identifier of that definition.
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface <mark>interface_identifier</mark> { /* interface_members... */ };
        partial interface <mark>interface_identifier</mark> { /* interface_members... */ };
        namespace <mark>namespace_identifier</mark> { /* namespace_members... */ };
        partial namespace <mark>namespace_identifier</mark> { /* namespace_members... */ };
        dictionary <mark>dictionary_identifier</mark> { /* dictionary_members... */ };
        partial dictionary <mark>dictionary_identifier</mark> { /* dictionary_members... */ };

        callback interface <mark>callback_interface_identifier</mark> { /* interface_members... */ };
    </pre>
*   For [=attributes=],
    [=typedefs=]
    and [=dictionary members=],
    the final <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token before the
    semicolon at the end of the declaration determines the identifier.
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        [extended_attributes]
        interface identifier {
          attribute type <mark>attribute_identifier</mark>;

        typedef type <mark>typedef_identifier</mark>;

        dictionary identifier {
          type <mark>dictionary_member_identifier</mark>;
        };
    </pre>
*   For [=constants=],
    the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token before the
    equals sign determines the identifier.
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">const type <mark>constant_identifier</mark> = 42;</pre>
*   For [=operations=], the
    <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token that appears
    after the return type but before the opening parenthesis (that is,
    one that is matched as part of the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-OptionalOperationName">OptionalOperationName</a></emu-nt>
    grammar symbol in an <emu-nt><a href="#prod-OperationRest">OperationRest</a></emu-nt>) determines the identifier of the operation.  If
    there is no such <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token,
    then the operation does not have an identifier.
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          return_type <mark>operation_identifier</mark>(/* arguments... */);
        };
    </pre>

Note: Operations can have no identifier when they are being used to declare a
[=special operation|special kind of operation=], such as a getter or setter.

For all of these constructs, the [=identifier=]
is the value of the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token with any leading
<span class="char">U+005F LOW LINE ("_")</span> character (underscore) removed.

Note: A leading <span class="char">"_"</span> is used to escape an identifier from looking
like a reserved word so that, for example, an interface named "<code>interface</code>" can be
defined.  The leading <span class="char">"_"</span> is dropped to unescape the
identifier.

Operation arguments can take a slightly wider set of identifiers.  In an operation
declaration, the identifier of an argument is specified immediately after its
type and is given by either an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t>
token or by one of the keywords that match the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword">ArgumentNameKeyword</a></emu-nt>
symbol.  If one of these keywords is used, it need not be escaped with a leading
underscore.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type operation_identifier(argument_type <mark>argument_identifier</mark> /* , ... */);
    };
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-ArgumentNameKeyword">
    ArgumentNameKeyword :
        "async"
        "attribute"
        "callback"
        "const"
        "constructor"
        "deleter"
        "dictionary"
        "enum"
        "getter"
        "includes"
        "inherit"
        "interface"

        "static"
        "stringifier"
        "typedef"
        "unrestricted"
</pre>

If an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token is used, then the
[=identifier=] of the operation argument
is the value of that token with any leading
<span class="char">U+005F LOW LINE ("_")</span> character (underscore) removed.
If instead one of the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword">ArgumentNameKeyword</a></emu-nt>
keyword token is used, then the [=identifier=] of the operation argument
is simply that token.

The [=identifier=] of any of the abovementioned
IDL constructs (except operation arguments) must not be "<code>constructor</code>",
"<code>toString</code>",
or begin with a <span class="char">U+005F LOW LINE ("_")</span> character.  These
are known as <dfn id="dfn-reserved-identifier" export>reserved identifiers</dfn>.

Although the "<code>toJSON</code>" [=identifier=] is not a [=reserved identifier=],
it must only be used for [=regular operations=]
that convert objects to [=JSON types=],
as described in [[#idl-tojson-operation]].

Note: Further restrictions on identifier names for particular constructs may be made
in later sections.

Within the set of [=IDL fragments=]
that a given implementation supports,
the [=identifier=] of every
[=interface=],
[=namespace=],
[=dictionary=],
[=enumeration=],
[=callback function=],
[=callback interface=] and
[=typedef=]
must not
be the same as the identifier of any other
[=interface=],
[=namespace=],
[=dictionary=],
[=enumeration=],
[=callback function=],
[=callback interface=] or
[=typedef=].

Within an [=IDL fragment=], a reference
to a [=definition=] need not appear after
the declaration of the referenced definition.  References can also be made
across [=IDL fragments=].

<div class="example">

    Therefore, the following [=IDL fragment=] is valid:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface B : A {
          undefined f(SequenceOfLongs x);
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
        };

        typedef sequence&lt;long&gt; SequenceOfLongs;
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    demonstrates how [=identifiers=]
    are given to definitions and [=interface members=].

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        // Typedef identifier: "number"
        typedef double number;

        // Interface identifier: "System"
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface System {

          // Operation identifier:          "createObject"
          // Operation argument identifier: "interface"
          object createObject(DOMString _interface);

          // Operation argument identifier: "interface"
          sequence&lt;object&gt; getObjects(DOMString interface);

          // Operation has no identifier; it declares a getter.
          getter DOMString (DOMString keyName);
        };

        // Interface identifier: "TextField"
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface TextField {

          // Attribute identifier: "const"
          attribute boolean _const;

          // Attribute identifier: "value"
          attribute DOMString? _value;
        };
    </pre>

    Note that while the second [=attribute=]
    on the <code class="idl">TextField</code> [=interface=]
    need not have been escaped with an underscore (because "<code>value</code>" is
    not a keyword in the IDL grammar), it is still unescaped
    to obtain the attribute’s [=identifier=].

<h3 id="idl-interfaces">Interfaces</h3>

[=IDL fragments=] are used to
describe object oriented systems.  In such systems, objects are entities
that have identity and which are encapsulations of state and behavior.
An <dfn id="dfn-interface" export>interface</dfn> is a definition (matching
<emu-t>interface</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-InterfaceRest">InterfaceRest</a></emu-nt>) that declares some
state and behavior that an object implementing that interface will expose.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    [extended_attributes]
    interface identifier {
      /* interface_members... */
    };
</pre>

An interface is a specification of a set of
<dfn id="dfn-interface-member" export lt="interface member">interface members</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-InterfaceMembers">InterfaceMembers</a></emu-nt>).
These are the [=members=] that appear between the braces in the interface declaration.

Interfaces in Web IDL describe how objects that implement the
interface behave.  In bindings for object oriented languages, it is
expected that an object that implements a particular IDL interface
provides ways to inspect and modify the object's state and to
invoke the behavior described by the interface.

An interface can be defined to <dfn id="dfn-inherit" for="interface" export>inherit</dfn> from another interface.
If the identifier of the interface is followed by a
<span class="char">U+003A COLON (":")</span> character
and an [=identifier=],
then that identifier identifies the inherited interface.
An object that implements an interface that inherits from another
also implements that inherited interface.  The object therefore will also
have members that correspond to the interface members from the inherited interface.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface identifier : <mark>identifier_of_inherited_interface</mark> {
      /* interface_members... */
    };
</pre>

The order that members appear in has significance for property enumeration in the <a href="#es-interfaces">ECMAScript binding</a>.

Interfaces may specify an interface member that has the same name as
one from an inherited interface.  Objects that implement the derived
interface will expose the member on the derived interface.  It is
language binding specific whether the overridden member can be
accessed on the object.

<div class="example">

    Consider the following two interfaces.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          undefined f();
          undefined g();
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface B : A {
          undefined f();
          undefined g(DOMString x);
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, an instance of <code class="idl">B</code>
    will have a prototype chain that looks like the following:

    <pre>
        [Object.prototype: the Object prototype object]
             ↑
        [A.prototype: interface prototype object for A]
             ↑
        [B.prototype: interface prototype object for B]
             ↑
        [instanceOfB]
    </pre>

    Calling <code>instanceOfB.f()</code> in ECMAScript will invoke the f defined
    on <code class="idl">B</code>.  However, the f from <code class="idl">A</code>
    can still be invoked on an object that implements <code class="idl">B</code> by
    calling <code>A.prototype.f.call(instanceOfB)</code>.

</div>

The <dfn id="dfn-inherited-interfaces" export>inherited interfaces</dfn> of
a given interface |A| is the set of all interfaces that |A|
inherits from, directly or indirectly.  If |A| does not [=interface/inherit=]
from another interface, then the set is empty.  Otherwise, the set
includes the interface |B| that |A| [=interface/inherits=]
from and all of |B|’s [=inherited interfaces=].

An interface must not be declared such that
its inheritance hierarchy has a cycle.  That is, an interface
|A| cannot inherit from itself, nor can it inherit from another
interface |B| that inherits from |A|, and so on.

<div algorithm>
  The [=list=] of <dfn for=interface>inclusive inherited interfaces</dfn> of an [=interface=] |I|
  is defined as follows:

    1.  Let |result| be « ».
    1.  Let |interface| be |I|.
    1.  While |interface| is not null:
        1.  [=list/Append=] |interface| to |result|.
        1.  Set |interface| to the [=interface=] that |I| [=interface/inherits=] from, if any, and
            null otherwise.
    1.  Return |result|.
</div>

Note that general multiple inheritance of interfaces is not supported, and
objects also cannot implement arbitrary sets of interfaces.
Objects can be defined to implement a single given interface |A|,
which means that it also implements all of |A|’s [=inherited interfaces=].
In addition, an [=includes statement=] can be used
to define that objects implementing an [=interface=] |A|
will always also include the [=interface mixin member|members=]
of the [=interface mixins=] |A| [=includes=].

Each interface member can be preceded by a list of [=extended attributes=] (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-ExtendedAttributeList">ExtendedAttributeList</a></emu-nt>),
which can control how the interface member will be handled in language bindings.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    [extended_attributes]
    interface identifier {

      [<mark>extended_attributes</mark>]
      const type constant_identifier = 42;

      [<mark>extended_attributes</mark>]
      attribute type identifier;

      [<mark>extended_attributes</mark>]
      return_type identifier(/* arguments... */);
    };
</pre>

The IDL for interfaces can be split into multiple parts by using
<dfn id="dfn-partial-interface" export>partial interface</dfn> definitions
(matching <emu-t>partial</emu-t> <emu-t>interface</emu-t>
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-PartialInterfaceRest">PartialInterfaceRest</a></emu-nt>).
The [=identifier=] of a partial
interface definition must be the same
as the identifier of an interface definition.  All of
the members that appear on each of the partial interfaces are considered to be
members of the interface itself.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface <mark>SomeInterface</mark> {
      /* interface_members... */
    };

    partial interface <mark>SomeInterface</mark> {
      /* interface_members... */
    };
</pre>

Note: Partial interface definitions are intended for use as a specification
editorial aide, allowing the definition of an interface to be separated
over more than one section of the document, and sometimes multiple documents.

The order of appearance of an [=interface=]
definition and any of its [=partial interface=]
definitions does not matter.

Note: A partial interface definition cannot specify that the interface
[=interface/inherits=] from another interface.
Inheritance must be specified on the original [=interface=]
definition.

The relevant language binding determines how interfaces correspond to constructs
in the language.

The following extended attributes are applicable to interfaces:
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}],
[{{Exposed}}],
[{{Global}}],
[{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}],
[{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}],
[{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}],
[{{LegacyWindowAlias}}], and
[{{SecureContext}}].

The following extended attributes are applicable to [=partial interfaces=]:
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}],
[{{Exposed}}],
[{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}], and
[{{SecureContext}}].

[=Interfaces=] must be annotated with an [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=].

<div algorithm>

The <dfn>qualified name</dfn> of an [=interface=] |interface| is defined as follows:

1.  Let |identifier| be the [=identifier=] of |interface|.
1.  If |interface| has a [{{LegacyNamespace}}] [=extended attribute=], then:
    1.  Let |namespace| be the identifier argument of the [{{LegacyNamespace}}]
        [=extended attribute=].
    1.  Return the [=concatenation=] of « |namespace|, |identifier| » with
        separator <span class="char">U+002E FULL STOP (".")</span>.
1. Return |identifier|.

    Plain objects can implement a [=callback interface=] like
    <code class="idl">EventListener</code>:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var node = getNode();                                // Obtain an instance of Node.

        var listener = {
          handleEvent: function(event) {
            // ...
          }
        };
        node.addEventListener("click", listener);            // This works.

        node.addEventListener("click", function() { ... });  // As does this.
    </pre>

    It is not possible for such an object to implement an [=interface=] like
    <code class="idl">Node</code>, however:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var node = getNode();  // Obtain an instance of Node.

        var newNode = {
          nodeName: "span",
          parentNode: null,
          appendChild: function(newchild) {
            // ...
          },
          addEventListener: function(type, listener) {
            // ...
          }
        };
        node.appendChild(newNode);  // This will throw a TypeError exception.
    </pre>
</div>


<h3 id="idl-interface-mixins">Interface mixins</h3>

An <dfn export>interface mixin</dfn> is a definition (matching <emu-t>interface</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-MixinRest">MixinRest</a></emu-nt>)
that declares state and behavior that can be [=included=] by one or more [=interfaces=],
and that are exposed by objects that implement an [=interface=]
that [=includes=] the [=interface mixin=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface mixin identifier {
      /* mixin_members... */
    };
</pre>

Note: [=Interface mixins=], much like [=partial interfaces=],
are intended for use as a specification editorial aide,
allowing a coherent set of functionalities to be grouped together,
and included in multiple interfaces, possibly across documents.
They are not meant to be exposed through language bindings.
Guidance on when to choose [=partial interfaces=], [=interface mixins=],
or [=partial interface mixins=] can be found in [[#using-mixins-and-partials]].

An [=interface mixin=] is a specification of a set of <dfn export lt="interface mixin member">interface mixin members</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-MixinMembers">MixinMembers</a></emu-nt>),
which are the [=constants=], [=regular operations=], [=regular attributes=], and [=stringifiers=]
that appear between the braces in the [=interface mixin=] declaration.

These [=constants=], [=regular operations=], [=regular attributes=], and [=stringifiers=]
describe the behaviors that can be implemented by an object,
as if they were specified on the [=interface=] that [=includes=] them.

[=Static attributes=], [=static operations=], [=special operations=] except for [=stringifiers=], and
[=iterable declaration|iterable=], [=asynchronously iterable declaration|asynchronously iterable=],
[=maplike declaration|maplike=], and [=setlike declarations=] cannot appear in [=interface mixin=]
declarations.

As with interfaces, the IDL for [=interface mixins=] can be split into multiple parts by using
<dfn export>partial interface mixin</dfn> definitions
(matching <emu-t>partial</emu-t> <emu-t>interface</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-MixinRest">MixinRest</a></emu-nt>).
The [=identifier=] of a [=partial interface mixin=] [=definition=] must
be the same as the [=identifier=] of an [=interface mixin=] [=definition=].
All of the [=interface mixin member|members=] that appear on each of the [=partial interface mixin=] [=definitions=]
are considered to be [=members=] of the [=interface mixin=] itself,
and—by extension—of the [=interfaces=] that [=include=] the [=interface mixin=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface mixin <mark>SomeMixin</mark> {
      /* mixin_members... */
    };

    partial interface mixin <mark>SomeMixin</mark> {
      /* mixin_members... */
    };
</pre>

The order that members appear in has significance for property enumeration
in the <a href="#es-namespaces">ECMAScript binding</a>.

Note that unlike [=interfaces=] or [=dictionaries=], [=interface mixins=] do not create types.

Of the extended attributes defined in this specification,
only the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}], [{{Exposed}}], and [{{SecureContext}}] extended attributes
are applicable to [=interface mixins=].

An <dfn>includes statement</dfn> is a definition
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-IncludesStatement">IncludesStatement</a></emu-nt>)
used to declare that all objects implementing an [=interface=] |I|
(identified by the first [=identifier=])
must additionally include the [=interface mixin member|members=] of [=interface mixin=] |M|
(identified by the second identifier).
[=Interface=] |I| is said to <dfn id="include" for="interface" export>include</dfn>
[=interface mixin=] |M|.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface_identifier includes mixin_identifier;
</pre>

The first [=identifier=] must reference a [=interface=] |I|.
The second identifier must reference an [=interface mixin=] |M|.

Each [=interface mixin member|member=] of |M| is considered to be
a [=member=] of each [=interface=] |I|, |J|, |K|, … that [=includes=] |M|,
as if a copy of each [=interface mixin member|member=] had been made.
So for a given member <var ignore>m</var> of |M|,
interface |I| is considered to have a [=member=] <var>m<sub>I</sub></var>,
interface |J| is considered to have a [=member=] <var>m<sub>J</sub></var>,
interface |K| is considered to have a [=member=] <var>m<sub>K</sub></var>, and so on.
The <dfn>host interfaces</dfn> of <var>m<sub>I</sub></var>, <var>m<sub>J</sub></var>,
and <var>m<sub>K</sub></var>, are |I|, |J|, and |K| respectively.

Note: In ECMAScript, this implies that each [=regular operation=]
declared as a [=interface mixin member|member=] of [=interface mixin=] |M|,
and exposed as a data property with a [=built-in function object=] value,
is a distinct [=built-in function object=]
in each [=interface prototype object=]
whose associated [=interface=] [=includes=] |M|.
Similarly, for [=attributes=], each copy of the accessor property has
distinct [=built-in function objects=] for its getters and setters.

The order of appearance of [=includes statements=] affects the order in which [=interface mixin=]
are [=included=] by their [=host interface=].

Issue: [=interface mixin member|Member=] order isn't clearly specified,
in particular when [=interface mixins=] are defined in separate documents.
It is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/432">issue #432</a>.

No [=extended attributes=] defined in this specification are applicable to [=includes statements=].

<div class="example" id="example-mixin">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an [=interface=], <code class="idl">Entry</code>,
    and an [=interface mixin=], <code class="idl">Observable</code>.
    The [=includes statement=] specifies that
    <code class="idl">Observable</code>'s [=interface mixin member|members=]
    are always included on objects implementing <code class="idl">Entry</code>.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface Entry {
          readonly attribute unsigned short entryType;
          // ...
        };

        interface mixin Observable {
          undefined addEventListener(DOMString type,
                                EventListener listener,
                                boolean useCapture);
          // ...
        };

        Entry includes Observable;
    </pre>

    An ECMAScript implementation would thus have an <code class="idl">addEventListener</code>
    property in the prototype chain of every <code class="idl">Entry</code>:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var e = getEntry();          // Obtain an instance of Entry.
        typeof e.addEventListener;   // Evaluates to "function".
    </pre>

<h4 id="using-mixins-and-partials">Using mixins and partials</h4>

<i>This section is informative.</i>

[=Interface mixins=] allow the sharing of [=attributes=], [=constants=], and [=operations=]
across <em>multiple</em> [=interfaces=].
If you're only planning to extend a single interface,
you might consider using a [=partial interface=] instead.

For example, instead of:

<pre highlight="webidl">
    interface mixin WindowSessionStorage {
      readonly attribute Storage sessionStorage;
    };
    Window includes WindowSessionStorage;
</pre>

do:

<pre highlight="webidl">
    partial interface Window {
      readonly attribute Storage sessionStorage;
    };
</pre>

Additionally, you can rely on extending [=interface mixins=] exposed by other specifications
to target common use cases, such as [=exposed|exposing=]
a set of [=attributes=], [=constants=], or [=operations=]
across both window and worker contexts.

For example, instead of the common but verbose:

<pre highlight="webidl">
    interface mixin GlobalCrypto {
      readonly attribute Crypto crypto;
    };

    Window includes GlobalCrypto;
    WorkerGlobalScope includes GlobalCrypto;
</pre>

you can extend the {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope}} [=interface mixin=] using a [=partial interface mixin=]:

<pre highlight="webidl">
    partial interface mixin WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
      readonly attribute Crypto crypto;
    };
</pre>


<h3 id="idl-callback-interfaces">Callback interfaces</h3>

A <dfn id="dfn-callback-interface" export>callback interface</dfn> is a [=definition=] matching
<emu-t>callback</emu-t> <emu-t>interface</emu-t>
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> <emu-t>{</emu-t>
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-CallbackInterfaceMembers">CallbackInterfaceMembers</a></emu-nt>
<emu-t>}</emu-t> <emu-t>;</emu-t>.
It can be implemented by any object, as described in [[#idl-objects]].

Note: A [=callback interface=] is not an [=interface=]. The name and syntax are left over from
earlier versions of this standard, where these concepts had more in common.

A [=callback interface=] is a specification of a set of
<dfn export lt="callback interface member">callback interface members</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-CallbackInterfaceMembers">CallbackInterfaceMembers</a></emu-nt>).
These are the [=members=] that appear between the braces in the interface declaration.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    callback interface identifier {
      /* interface_members... */
    };
</pre>

Note: See also the similarly named [=callback function=] definition.

[=Callback interfaces=] must define exactly one [=regular operation=].

<div class="advisement">

    Specification authors should not define
    [=callback interfaces=]
    unless required to describe the requirements of existing APIs.
    Instead, a [=callback function=] should be used.

    The definition of {{EventListener}} as a
    [=callback interface=]
    is an example of an existing API that needs to allow
    objects with a
    given property (in this case <code class="idl">handleEvent</code>) to be considered to implement the interface.
    For new APIs, and those for which there are no compatibility concerns,
    using a [=callback function=] will allow
    only a [=function object=] (in the ECMAScript
    language binding).

</div>

[=Callback interfaces=] which declare [=constants=]
must be annotated with an [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=].


<pre class="grammar" id="prod-CallbackRestOrInterface">
    CallbackRestOrInterface :

        RegularOperation
</pre>


<h3 id="idl-members">Members</h3>

[=Interfaces=], [=interface mixins=], and [=namespaces=] are specifications of a set of
<dfn id="dfn-member" export lt="members">members</dfn> (respectively matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-InterfaceMembers">InterfaceMembers</a></emu-nt>,
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-MixinMembers">MixinMembers</a></emu-nt>, and
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-NamespaceMembers">NamespaceMembers</a></emu-nt>),
which are the [=constants=], [=attributes=], [=operations=], and
other declarations that appear between the braces of their declarations.
[=Attributes=] describe the state that an object
implementing the [=interface=], [=interface mixin=], or [=namespace=] will expose,
and [=operations=] describe the behaviors that can be invoked on the object.
[=Constants=] declare named constant values
that are exposed as a convenience to users of objects in the system.

<div class="note">

    When an [=interface=] [=includes=] an [=interface mixin=], each [=member=]
    of the interface mixin is also considered a member of the interface. In contrast,
    [=interface/inherit|inherited=] interface members are not considered members
    of the interface.

</div>

The [=constructor steps=], [=getter steps=], [=setter steps=], and [=method steps=] for the various
[=members=] defined on an [=interface=] or [=interface mixin=] have access to a
<dfn export>this</dfn> value, which is an IDL value of the [=interface=] type that the member is
declared on or that [=includes=] the [=interface mixin=] the member is declared on.

[=Setter steps=] also have access to <dfn export>the given value</dfn>,
which is an IDL value of the type the [=attribute=] is declared as.

[=Interfaces=], [=interface mixins=], [=callback interfaces=] and [=namespaces=] each support a
different set of [=members=],

<h4 id="idl-constants">Constants</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-constant" export>constant</dfn> is a declaration (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Const">Const</a></emu-nt>) used to bind a constant value to a name.
Constants can appear on [=interfaces=] and [=callback interfaces=].

<p class="advisement">
    Constants have in the past primarily been used to define
    named integer codes in the style of an enumeration.  The Web platform
    is moving away from this design pattern in favor of the use of strings.
    Editors who wish to use this feature are strongly advised to discuss this
    by <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/new?title=Intent%20to%20use%20Constants">filing an issue</a>
    before proceeding.
</p>

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">const type constant_identifier = 42;</pre>

The [=identifier=] of a
[=constant=]
must not be the same as the identifier
of another [=interface member=] or [=callback interface member=]
defined on the same [=interface=] or [=callback interface=].
The identifier also must not
be "<code>length</code>", "<code>name</code>" or "<code>prototype</code>".

Note: These three names are the names of properties that are defined on the
[=interface object=] in the ECMAScript language binding.

The type of a constant (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ConstType">ConstType</a></emu-nt>)
must not be any type other than
a [=primitive type=].
If an [=identifier=] is used,
it must reference a [=typedef=]
whose type is a primitive type.

The <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ConstValue">ConstValue</a></emu-nt> part of a
constant declaration gives the value of the constant, which can be
one of the two boolean literal tokens (<emu-t>true</emu-t>
and <emu-t>false</emu-t>), an
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token,
a <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token,
or one of the three special floating point constant values
(<emu-t>-Infinity</emu-t>, <emu-t>Infinity</emu-t> and <emu-t>NaN</emu-t>).

Note: These values – in addition to strings and the empty sequence – can also be used to specify the
[=dictionary member/default value|default value of a dictionary member=] or [=optional argument/default value|of an optional argument=].  Note that strings, the
empty sequence <emu-t>[]</emu-t>, and the default dictionary <emu-t>{}</emu-t> cannot be used as the value of a
[=constant=].

The value of the boolean literal tokens <emu-t>true</emu-t> and
<emu-t>false</emu-t> are the IDL {{boolean}} values
<code class="idl">true</code> and <code class="idl">false</code>.

<div algorithm="value of integer tokens">

    The value of an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token

    1.  Return |sign| × |number|.

The type of an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token is the same
as the type of the constant, dictionary member or optional argument it is being used as the value of.
The value of the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token must not

    1.  Otherwise, the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token is being

</dl>

The type of a <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token is the same
as the type of the constant, dictionary member or optional argument it is being used as the value of.
The value of the <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token must not
lie outside the valid range of values for its type, as given in [[#idl-types]].
Also, <emu-t>Infinity</emu-t>, <emu-t>-Infinity</emu-t> and <emu-t>NaN</emu-t> must not
be used as the value of a {{float}} or {{double}}.

The value of the <emu-t>null</emu-t> token is the special
<emu-val>null</emu-val> value that is a member of the
[=nullable types=].  The type of
the <emu-t>null</emu-t> token is the same as the
type of the constant, dictionary member or optional argument it is being used as the value of.

If |VT| is the type of the value assigned to a constant, and |DT|
is the type of the constant, dictionary member or optional argument itself, then these types must
be compatible, which is the case if |DT| and |VT| are identical,
or |DT| is a [=nullable type=]
whose [=nullable types/inner type=] is |VT|.

[=Constants=] are not associated with
particular instances of the [=interface=] or [=callback interface=]
on which they appear.  It is language binding specific whether
[=constants=] are exposed on instances.

<div class="note">

    The ECMAScript language binding does however
    allow [=constants=] to be accessed
    through objects implementing the IDL [=interfaces=]
    on which the [=constants=] are declared.
    For example, with the following IDL:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          const short rambaldi = 47;
        };
    </pre>

    the constant value can be accessed in ECMAScript  either as
    <code>A.rambaldi</code> or <code>instanceOfA.rambaldi</code>.

The following extended attributes are applicable to constants:
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}],
[{{Exposed}}], and
[{{SecureContext}}].

<h4 id="idl-attributes">Attributes</h4>

An <dfn id="dfn-attribute" export>attribute</dfn> is an [=interface member=] or [=namespace member=]
(matching
<emu-t>inherit</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-AttributeRest">AttributeRest</a></emu-nt>,
<emu-t>static</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-OptionalReadOnly">OptionalReadOnly</a></emu-nt> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-AttributeRest">AttributeRest</a></emu-nt>,

<emu-nt><a href="#prod-OptionalReadOnly">OptionalReadOnly</a></emu-nt> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-AttributeRest">AttributeRest</a></emu-nt>,
or <emu-nt><a href="#prod-AttributeRest">AttributeRest</a></emu-nt>)
that is used to declare data fields with a given type and
[=identifier=] whose value can
be retrieved and (in some cases) changed.  There are two kinds of attributes:

1.  [=regular attributes=], which are those
    used to declare that objects implementing the [=interface=]
    will have a data field member with the given [=identifier=]
        <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          attribute type identifier;
        };
    </pre>
1.  [=static attributes=], which are used
    to declare attributes that are not associated with a particular object implementing the interface
        <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          static attribute type identifier;
        };
    </pre>

If an attribute has no <emu-t>static</emu-t> keyword, then it declares a
<dfn id="dfn-regular-attribute" export>regular attribute</dfn>.  Otherwise,
it declares a [=static attribute=]. Note that in addition to being [=interface members=],
[=read only=] [=regular attributes=] can be [=namespace members=] as well.

The <dfn>getter steps</dfn> of an attribute |attr| should be introduced using text of the form “The
<code>|attr|</code> getter steps are:” followed by a list, or “The <code>|attr|</code> getter steps
are to” followed by an inline description.

The <dfn>setter steps</dfn> of an attribute |attr| should be introduced using text of the form “The
<code>|attr|</code> setter steps are:” followed by a list, or “The <code>|attr|</code> setter steps
are to” followed by an inline description.

The [=identifier=] of an
[=attribute=]
must not be the same as the identifier
of another [=interface member=]
defined on the same [=interface=].
The identifier of a static attribute must not
be "<code>prototype</code>".

The type of the attribute is given by the type (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>)
that appears after the <emu-t>attribute</emu-t> keyword.
If the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt> is an
[=identifier=] or an identifier followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>,
then the identifier must
identify an [=interface=], [=enumeration=],
[=callback function=], [=callback interface=] or [=typedef=].

The type of the attribute, after resolving typedefs, must not be a
[=nullable type|nullable=] or non-nullable version of any of the following types:

*   a [=sequence type=]
*   a [=dictionary type=]
*   a [=record type=]
*   a [=union type=]
    that has a nullable or non-nullable sequence type, dictionary,
    or record
    as one of its [=flattened member types=]

The attribute is <dfn id="dfn-read-only" export>read only</dfn> if the
<emu-t>readonly</emu-t> keyword is used before the <emu-t>attribute</emu-t> keyword.
An object that implements the interface on which a read only attribute
is defined will not allow assignment to that attribute.  It is language
binding specific whether assignment is simply disallowed by the language,
ignored or an exception is thrown.

    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      readonly attribute type identifier;
    };
</pre>

Attributes whose type is a [=promise type=] must be [=read only=]. Additionally, they cannot have
any of the [=extended attributes=] [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}], [{{PutForwards}}], [{{Replaceable}}], or
[{{SameObject}}].

A [=regular attribute=]
that is not [=read only=]
can be declared to <dfn id="dfn-inherit-getter" export>inherit its getter</dfn>
from an ancestor interface.  This can be used to make a read only attribute
in an ancestor interface be writable on a derived interface.  An attribute
[=inherit its getter|inherits its getter=] if
its declaration includes <emu-t>inherit</emu-t> in the declaration.
The read only attribute from which the attribute inherits its getter
is the attribute with the same identifier on the closest ancestor interface
of the one on which the inheriting attribute is defined.  The attribute
whose getter is being inherited must be
of the same type as the inheriting attribute.

Note: The grammar ensures that <emu-t>inherit</emu-t> does not appear on a [=read only=] attribute
or a [=static attribute=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    [Exposed=Window]
    interface Ancestor {
      readonly attribute TheType theIdentifier;
    };

    [Exposed=Window]
    interface Derived : Ancestor {
      inherit attribute TheType theIdentifier;
    };
</pre>

When the <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword is used
in a [=regular attribute=]
declaration, it indicates that objects implementing the
interface will be stringified to the value of the attribute.  See
[[#idl-stringifiers]] for details.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      stringifier attribute DOMString identifier;
    };
</pre>

The following [=extended attributes=]
are applicable to regular and static attributes:
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}],
[{{Exposed}}],
[{{SameObject}}], and
[{{SecureContext}}].

The following [=extended attributes=]
are applicable only to regular attributes:
[{{LegacyLenientSetter}}],
[{{LegacyLenientThis}}],
[{{PutForwards}}],
[{{Replaceable}}],
[{{LegacyUnforgeable}}].

        };
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="idl-operations">Operations</h4>

An <dfn id="dfn-operation" export>operation</dfn> is an [=interface member=], [=callback interface
member=] or [=namespace member=]
(matching <emu-t>static</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-RegularOperation">RegularOperation</a></emu-nt>,
<emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-RegularOperation">RegularOperation</a></emu-nt>,
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-RegularOperation">RegularOperation</a></emu-nt> or
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-SpecialOperation">SpecialOperation</a></emu-nt>)
that defines a behavior that can be invoked on objects implementing the interface.
There are three kinds of operation:

1.  [=regular operations=], which
    are those used to declare that objects implementing the
    [=interface=] will have a method with
    the given [=identifier=]
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          return_type identifier(/* arguments... */);
        };
    </pre>
1.  [=special operations=],
    which are used to declare special behavior on objects
    implementing the interface, such as object indexing and stringification
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          /* special_keyword */ return_type identifier(/* arguments... */);
          /* special_keyword */ return_type (/* arguments... */);
        };
    </pre>
1.  [=static operations=],
    which are used to declare operations that are not associated with
    a particular object implementing the interface
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        interface interface_identifier {
          static return_type identifier(/* arguments... */);
        };
    </pre>

If an operation has an identifier but no <emu-t>static</emu-t>
keyword, then it declares a <dfn id="dfn-regular-operation" export>regular operation</dfn>.
If the operation has a
[=special keyword=]
used in its declaration (that is, any keyword matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Special">Special</a></emu-nt>, or
the <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword),
then it declares a special operation.  A single operation can declare
both a regular operation and a special operation;
see [[#idl-special-operations]] for details on special operations.
Note that in addition to being [=interface members=],
regular operations can also be [=callback interface members=] and [=namespace members=].

If an operation has no identifier,
then it must be declared to be a special operation
using one of the special keywords.

The identifier of a [=regular operation=] or [=static operation=]
must not be the same as the identifier
of a [=constant=] or [=attribute=]
defined on the same [=interface=], [=callback interface=] or [=namespace=].
The identifier of a static operation must not be "<code>prototype</code>".

Note: The identifier can be the same
as that of another operation on the interface, however.
This is how operation overloading is specified.

The [=identifier=] of a [=static operation=]
also must not be the same as the identifier
of a [=regular operation=]
defined on the same [=interface=].

The <dfn id="dfn-return-type" export>return type</dfn> of the operation is given
by the type (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>)
that appears before the operation’s optional [=identifier=].
If the return type is an
[=identifier=] followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>,
then the identifier must
identify an [=interface=], [=dictionary=], [=enumeration=],
[=callback function=], [=callback interface=] or [=typedef=].

An operation’s arguments (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentList">ArgumentList</a></emu-nt>)
are given between the parentheses in the declaration.  Each individual argument is specified
as a type (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>) followed by an [=identifier=]
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentName">ArgumentName</a></emu-nt>).

Note: For expressiveness, the identifier of an operation argument can also be specified
as one of the keywords matching the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword">ArgumentNameKeyword</a></emu-nt>
symbol without needing to escape it.

If the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt> of an operation argument is an identifier
followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>,
then the identifier must identify an [=interface=],
[=enumeration=], [=callback function=], [=callback interface=],
or [=typedef=].
If the operation argument type is an [=identifier=]
not followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>, then the identifier must
identify any one of those definitions or a [=dictionary=].

If the operation argument type, after resolving typedefs,
is a [=nullable type=],
its [=nullable types/inner type=] must not be a [=dictionary type=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type identifier(type identifier, type identifier /* , ... */);
    };
</pre>

The identifier of each argument must not be the same
as the identifier of another argument in the same operation declaration.

Each argument can be preceded by a list of
[=extended attributes=] (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-ExtendedAttributeList">ExtendedAttributeList</a></emu-nt>),
which can control how a value passed as the argument will be handled in
language bindings.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type identifier([<mark>extended_attributes</mark>] type identifier, [<mark>extended_attributes</mark>] type identifier /* , ... */);
    };
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    demonstrates how [=regular operations=]
    can be declared on an [=interface=]:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dimensions {
          attribute unsigned long width;
          attribute unsigned long height;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Button {

          // An operation that takes no arguments and returns a boolean.
          boolean isMouseOver();

          // Overloaded operations.
          undefined setDimensions(Dimensions size);
          undefined setDimensions(unsigned long width, unsigned long height);
        };
    </pre>
</div>

An operation or [=constructor operation=] is considered to be
<dfn id="dfn-variadic" export>variadic</dfn>
if the final argument uses the <emu-t>...</emu-t> token just
after the argument type.  Declaring an operation to be variadic indicates that
the operation can be invoked with any number of arguments after that final argument.
Those extra implied formal arguments are of the same type as the final explicit
argument in the operation declaration.  The final argument can also be omitted
when invoking the operation.  An argument must not
be declared with the <emu-t>...</emu-t> token unless it
is the final argument in the operation’s argument list.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type identifier(type<mark>...</mark> identifier);
      return_type identifier(type identifier, type<mark>...</mark> identifier);
    };
</pre>

[=Extended attributes=]
that [=takes an argument list|take an argument list=]
([{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}], of those
defined in this specification) and [=callback functions=]
are also considered to be [=variadic=]
when the <emu-t>...</emu-t> token is used in their argument lists.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface that has
    two variadic operations:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface IntegerSet {
          readonly attribute unsigned long cardinality;

          undefined union(long... ints);
          undefined intersection(long... ints);
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript binding, variadic operations are implemented by
    functions that can accept the subsequent arguments:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var s = getIntegerSet();  // Obtain an instance of IntegerSet.

        s.union();                // Passing no arguments corresponding to 'ints'.
        s.union(1, 4, 7);         // Passing three arguments corresponding to 'ints'.
    </pre>

    A binding for a language that does not support variadic functions
    might specify that an explicit array or list of integers be passed
    to such an operation.

</div>

An argument is considered to be an <dfn id="dfn-optional-argument" export>optional argument</dfn>
if it is declared with the <emu-t>optional</emu-t> keyword.
The final argument of a [=variadic=] operation
is also considered to be an optional argument. Declaring an argument
to be optional indicates that the argument value can be omitted
when the operation is invoked.  The final argument in an
operation must not explicitly be declared to be
optional if the operation is [=variadic=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type identifier(type identifier, optional type identifier);
    };
</pre>

Optional arguments can also have a <dfn id="dfn-optional-argument-default-value" for="optional argument" export>default value</dfn>
specified.  If the argument’s identifier is followed by a <span class="char">U+003D EQUALS SIGN ("=")</span>
and a value (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-DefaultValue">DefaultValue</a></emu-nt>),
then that gives the optional argument its [=optional argument/default value=].
The implicitly optional final argument of a [=variadic=]
operation must not have a default value specified.
The default value is the value to be assumed when the operation is called with the
corresponding argument omitted.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      return_type identifier(type identifier, optional type identifier = "value");
    };
</pre>

<p class="advisement">
    It is strongly suggested not to use a [=optional argument/default value=]
    of <emu-val>true</emu-val> for {{boolean}}-typed arguments,
    as this can be confusing for authors who might otherwise expect the default
    conversion of <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> to be used (i.e., <emu-val>false</emu-val>).
    [[API-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]]
</p>

If the type of an argument is a [=dictionary type=] or a [=union type=] that has
a [=dictionary type=] as one
of its [=flattened member types=], and that dictionary type and its ancestors have no
[=dictionary member/required=] [=dictionary member|members=], and the argument is either the final argument or is
followed only by [=optional arguments=], then the argument must be specified as
optional and have a default value provided.

<div class="note">

    This is to encourage API designs that do not require authors to pass an
    empty dictionary value when they wish only to use the dictionary’s
    default values.

    Usually the default value provided will be <emu-t>{}</emu-t>, but in the
    case of a [=union type=] that has a dictionary type as one of its
    [=flattened member types=] a default value could be provided that
    initializes some other member of the union.
</div>

When a boolean literal token (<emu-t>true</emu-t> or <emu-t>false</emu-t>),
the <emu-t>null</emu-t> token,
an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token, a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token or one of
the three special floating point literal values (<emu-t>Infinity</emu-t>,
<emu-t>-Infinity</emu-t> or <emu-t>NaN</emu-t>) is used as the
[=optional argument/default value=],
it is interpreted in the same way as for a [=constant=].

<div id="string-literal" algorithm="value of string literal tokens">
    Optional argument default values can also be specified using a

If the type of the [=optional argument=]
is an [=enumeration=], then its
[=optional argument/default value=] if specified must
be one of the [=enumeration values|enumeration’s values=].

Optional argument default values can also be specified using the
two token value <emu-t>[]</emu-t>, which represents an empty sequence
value.  The type of this value is the same as the type of the optional
argument it is being used as the default value of.  That type
must be a [=sequence type=], a [=nullable type=] whose [=nullable types/inner type=] is a
[=sequence type=] or a [=union type=] or [=nullable type|nullable=] union type
that has a [=sequence type=] in its [=flattened member types=].

Optional argument default values can also be specified using the two token value
<emu-t>{}</emu-t>, which represents a default-initialized (as if from ES
<emu-t>null</emu-t> or an object with no properties) dictionary value.  The type
of this value is the same as the type of the optional argument it is being used
as the default value of.  That type must be a [=dictionary type=], or a [=union
type=] that has a [=dictionary type=] in its [=flattened member types=].

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an [=interface=]
    with a single [=operation=]
    that can be invoked with two different argument list lengths:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface ColorCreator {
          object createColor(double v1, double v2, double v3, optional double alpha);
        };
    </pre>

    It is equivalent to an [=interface=]
    that has two [=overloaded=]
    [=operations=]:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface ColorCreator {
          object createColor(double v1, double v2, double v3);
          object createColor(double v1, double v2, double v3, double alpha);
        };
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an [=interface=]

        interface AddressBook {
          boolean hasAddressForName(USVString name, optional LookupOptions options = {});
        };
    </pre>

    If <code>hasAddressForName</code> is called with only one argument, the
    second argument will be a default-initialized <code>LookupOptions</code>
    dictionary, which will cause <code>caseSensitive</code> to be set to
    <emu-t>false</emu-t>.

<h5 id="idl-tojson-operation">toJSON</h5>

By declaring a <code>toJSON</code> [=regular operation=],
an [=interface=] specifies how to convert the objects that implement it to [=JSON types=].

The <code>toJSON</code> [=regular operation=] is reserved for this usage.
It must take zero arguments and return a [=JSON type=].

The <dfn id="dfn-json-types" export lt="JSON type">JSON types</dfn> are:

*   [=numeric types=],
*   {{boolean}},
*   [=string types=],
*   [=nullable types=] whose [=nullable types/inner type=] is a [=JSON type=],
*   [=annotated types=] whose [=annotated types/inner type=] is a [=JSON type=],
*   [=union types=] whose [=member types=] are [=JSON types=],
*   [=typedefs=] whose [=type being given a new name=] is a [=JSON type=],
*   [=sequence types=] whose parameterized type is a [=JSON type=],
*   [=frozen array types=] whose parameterized type is a [=JSON type=],
*   [=dictionary types=] where the types of all [=dictionary members|members=] declared on the dictionary and all its [=inherited dictionaries=] are [=JSON types=],
*   [=records=] where all of their [=map/values=] are [=JSON types=],
*   {{object}},
*   [=interface types=] that have a <code>toJSON</code> operation declared on themselves or
    one of their [=inherited interfaces=].

How the <code>toJSON</code> [=regular operation=]
is made available on an object in a language binding,
and how exactly the [=JSON types=] are converted into a JSON string,
is language binding specific.

Note: In the ECMAScript language binding,
this is done by exposing a <code>toJSON</code> method
which returns the [=JSON type=]
converted into an ECMAScript value
that can be turned into a JSON string
by the {{JSON.stringify()}} function.
Additionally, in the ECMAScript language binding,
the <code>toJSON</code> operation can take a [{{Default}}] [=extended attribute=],
in which case the [=default toJSON steps=] are exposed instead.

<div class="example" id="tojson-example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface <code class="idl">Transaction</code>
    that has a <code>toJSON</code> method defined in prose:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Transaction {
          readonly attribute DOMString from;
          readonly attribute DOMString to;
          readonly attribute double amount;
          readonly attribute DOMString description;
          readonly attribute unsigned long number;
          TransactionJSON toJSON();
        };

        dictionary TransactionJSON {
          Account from;
          Account to;
          double amount;
          DOMString description;
        };
    </pre>

    The <code>toJSON</code> [=regular operation=] of <code class="idl">Transaction</code> [=interface=]
    could be defined as follows:


    <div algorithm="example tojson">

        The <code>toJSON()</code> method steps are:

        1.  Let |json| be a new [=map=].
        1.  [=list/For each=] attribute [=identifier=] |attr| in « "from", "to", "amount", "description" »:
            1.  Let |value| be the result of running the [=getter steps=] of |attr| on [=this=].
            1.  Set |json|[|attr|] to |value|.
        1.  Return |json|.
    </div>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, there would exist a <code>toJSON()</code> method on
    <code class="idl">Transaction</code> objects:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Get an instance of Transaction.
        var txn = getTransaction();

        // Evaluates to an object like this:
        // {
        //   from: "Bob",
        //   to: "Alice",
        //   amount: 50,
        //   description: "books"
        // }
        txn.toJSON();

        // Evaluates to a string like this:
        // '{"from":"Bob","to":"Alice","amount":50,"description":"books"}'
        JSON.stringify(txn);
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id=idl-constructors oldids="Constructor" dfn>Constructor operations</h4>

If an [=interface=] has a [=constructor operation=] member (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Constructor">Constructor</a></emu-nt>), it indicates that it is possible to
create objects that [=implement=] the [=interface=] using a [=constructor=].

Multiple [=constructor operations=] may appear on a given [=interface=].
For each [=constructor operation=] on the [=interface=], there will be a way to attempt to
construct an instance by passing the specified arguments.

The <dfn>constructor steps</dfn> of a [=constructor operation=] that is a member of an interface
named |interface| should be introduced using text of the form “The
<code>new |interface|(<var ignore>arg1</var>, <var ignore>arg2</var>, ...)</code> constructor steps
are:” followed by a list, or “The
<code>new |interface|(<var ignore>arg1</var>, <var ignore>arg2</var>, ...)</code> constructor steps
are to” followed by an inline description.

The <a>constructor steps</a> must do nothing, initialize the value passed as [=this=], or throw an
exception.

<p class=example id=example-constructor-steps>If the constructor does not initialize
[=this=], one can write “The <code>new Example(<var ignore>init</var>)</code> constructor
steps are to do nothing.”

See [[#interface-object]] for details on how a [=constructor operation=] is to be implemented.

<div class="example">

    The following IDL defines two interfaces. The second has [=constructor operations=], while the
    first does not.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface NodeList {
          Node item(unsigned long index);
          readonly attribute unsigned long length;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Circle {
          constructor();
          constructor(double radius);
          attribute double r;
          attribute double cx;
          attribute double cy;
          readonly attribute double circumference;
        };
    </pre>

    An ECMAScript implementation supporting these interfaces would implement a \[[Construct]]
    internal method on the <code class="idl">Circle</code> interface object which would return a
    new object that [=implements=] the interface.
    It would take either zero or one argument.

    Issue(heycam/webidl#698): It is unclear whether the <code class="idl">NodeList</code> interface
    object would implement a \[[Construct]] internal method. In any case, trying to use it as a
    constructor will cause a {{TypeError}} to be thrown.

    <pre highlight="js">
        var x = new Circle();      // This uses the zero-argument constructor to create a
                                   // reference to a platform object that implements the
                                   // Circle interface.

        var y = new Circle(1.25);  // This also creates a Circle object, this time using
                                   // the one-argument constructor.

        var z = new NodeList();    // This would throw a TypeError, since no
                                   // constructor is declared.

<h4 id="idl-special-operations">Special operations</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-special-operation" export>special operation</dfn> is a
declaration of a certain kind of special behavior on objects implementing
the interface on which the special operation declarations appear.
Special operations are declared by using a
<dfn id="dfn-special-keyword" export>special keyword</dfn>
in an operation declaration.

There are four kinds of special operations. The table below indicates
for a given kind of special operation what special keyword
is used to declare it and what the purpose of the special operation is:

<table class="vert data">
    <tr>
        <th>Special operation</th>
        <th>Keyword</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><dfn id="dfn-getter" export lt="getter">Getters</dfn></td>
        <td><emu-t>getter</emu-t></td>
        <td>Defines behavior for when an object is indexed for property retrieval.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><dfn id="dfn-setter" export lt="setter">Setters</dfn></td>
        <td><emu-t>setter</emu-t></td>
        <td>Defines behavior for when an object is indexed for property
        assignment or creation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><dfn id="dfn-deleter" export lt="deleter">Deleters</dfn></td>
        <td><emu-t>deleter</emu-t></td>
        <td>Defines behavior for when an object is indexed for property deletion.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><dfn id="dfn-stringifier" export lt="stringifier">Stringifiers</dfn></td>
        <td><emu-t>stringifier</emu-t></td>
        <td>Defines how an object is converted into a {{DOMString}}.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Not all language bindings support all of the four kinds of special
object behavior.  When special operations are declared using
operations with no identifier, then in language bindings that do
not support the particular kind of special operations there simply
will not be such functionality.

<div class="example">

    The following IDL fragment defines an interface with a getter and a setter:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dictionary {
          readonly attribute unsigned long propertyCount;

          getter double (DOMString propertyName);
          setter undefined (DOMString propertyName, double propertyValue);
        };
    </pre>

    In language bindings that do not support property getters and setters,
    objects implementing [=Dictionary=] will not
    have that special behavior.

</div>

Defining a special operation  with an [=identifier=]
is equivalent to separating the special operation out into its own
declaration without an identifier.  This approach is allowed to
simplify [=method steps=] of an interface’s operations.

<div class="example">

    The following two interfaces are equivalent:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dictionary {
          readonly attribute unsigned long propertyCount;

          getter double getProperty(DOMString propertyName);
          setter undefined setProperty(DOMString propertyName, double propertyValue);
        };
    </pre>
    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dictionary {
          readonly attribute unsigned long propertyCount;

          double getProperty(DOMString propertyName);
          undefined setProperty(DOMString propertyName, double propertyValue);

          getter double (DOMString propertyName);
          setter undefined (DOMString propertyName, double propertyValue);
        };
    </pre>
</div>

A given [=special keyword=] must not
appear twice on an operation.

Getters and setters come in two varieties: ones that
take a {{DOMString}} as a property name,
known as
<dfn id="dfn-named-property-getter" export lt="named property getter">named property getters</dfn> and
<dfn id="dfn-named-property-setter" export lt="named property setter">named property setters</dfn>,
and ones that take an {{unsigned long}}
as a property index, known as
<dfn id="dfn-indexed-property-getter" export lt="indexed property getter">indexed property getters</dfn> and
<dfn id="dfn-indexed-property-setter" export lt="indexed property setter">indexed property setters</dfn>.
There is only one variety of deleter:
<dfn id="dfn-named-property-deleter" export lt="named property deleter">named property deleters</dfn>.
See [[#idl-indexed-properties]]
and [[#idl-named-properties]]
for details.

On a given [=interface=],
there must exist at most one
stringifier, at most one
[=named property deleter=],
and at most one of each variety of getter and setter.

If an interface has a setter of a given variety,
then it must also have a getter of that
variety.  If it has a [=named property deleter=],
then it must also have a
[=named property getter=].

Special operations declared using operations must not
be [=variadic=] nor have any
[=optional arguments=].

If an object implements more than one [=interface=]
that defines a given special operation, then it is undefined which (if any)
special operation is invoked for that operation.


<h5 id="idl-stringifiers">Stringifiers</h5>

When an [=interface=] has a
[=stringifier=], it indicates that objects that implement
the interface have a non-default conversion to a string.  As mentioned above,
stringifiers can be specified using an [=operation=]
declared with the <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      stringifier DOMString identifier();
      stringifier DOMString ();
    };
</pre>

If an operation used to declare a stringifier does not have an
[=identifier=], then prose
accompanying the interface must define
the <dfn id="dfn-stringification-behavior" export>stringification behavior</dfn>
of the interface.  If the operation does have an identifier,
then the object is converted to a string by invoking the
operation to obtain the string.

Stringifiers declared with operations must
be declared to take zero arguments and return a {{DOMString}}.

As a shorthand, if the <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword
is declared using an operation with no identifier, then the
operation’s [=return type=] and
argument list can be omitted.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      stringifier;
    };
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following two interfaces are equivalent:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          stringifier DOMString ();
        };
    </pre>
    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          stringifier;
        };
    </pre>
</div>

The <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword
can also be placed on an [=attribute=].
In this case, the string to convert the object to is the
value of the attribute.  The <emu-t>stringifier</emu-t> keyword
must not be placed on an attribute unless
it is declared to be of type {{DOMString}} or {{USVString}}.
It also must not be placed on
a [=static attribute=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      stringifier attribute DOMString identifier;
    };
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-Stringifier">
    Stringifier :
        "stringifier" StringifierRest
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-StringifierRest">
    StringifierRest :
        OptionalReadOnly AttributeRest
        RegularOperation
        ";"
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an interface that will stringify to the value of its
    <code class="idl">name</code> attribute:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Student {
          constructor();
          attribute unsigned long id;
          stringifier attribute DOMString name;
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript binding, using a <code class="idl">Student</code>
    object in a context where a string is expected will result in the
    value of the object’s <code class="idl">name</code> property being
    used:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var s = new Student();
        s.id = 12345678;
        s.name = '周杰倫';

        var greeting = 'Hello, ' + s + '!';  // Now greeting == 'Hello, 周杰倫!'.
    </pre>

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an interface that has custom stringification behavior that is
    not specified in the IDL itself.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Student {
          constructor();
          attribute unsigned long id;
          attribute DOMString? familyName;
          attribute DOMString givenName;

          stringifier DOMString ();
        };
    </pre>

    Thus, prose is required to explain the stringification behavior.
    We assume that the <code class="idl">familyName</code> and
    <code class="idl">givenName</code> attributes are backed by
    family name and given name concepts, respectively.

    <blockquote>

        The [=stringification behavior=] steps are:

        1. If [=this=]'s family name is null, then return [=this=]'s given name.
        2. Return the concatenation of [=this=]'s given name, followed by U+0020 SPACE, followed by [=this=]'s family name.

    </blockquote>

    An ECMAScript implementation of the IDL would behave as follows:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var s = new Student();
        s.id = 12345679;
        s.familyName = 'Smithee';
        s.givenName = 'Alan';

        var greeting = 'Hi ' + s;  // Now greeting == 'Hi Alan Smithee'.
    </pre>
</div>


<h5 id="idl-indexed-properties" dfn export>Indexed properties</h5>

An [=interface=] that defines an [=indexed property getter=]
is said to <dfn id="dfn-support-indexed-properties" export>support indexed properties</dfn>.
By extension, a [=platform object=]
is said to [=support indexed properties=] if
it implements an [=interface=] that itself does.

If an interface [=support indexed properties|supports indexed properties=],
then the interface definition must be accompanied by
a description of what indices the object can be indexed with at
any given time. These indices are called the <dfn id="dfn-supported-property-indices" export>supported property indices</dfn>.

Interfaces that [=support indexed properties=] must define
an [=integer types|integer-typed=] [=attribute=] named "<code>length</code>".

Indexed property getters must
be declared to take a single {{unsigned long}} argument.
Indexed property setters must
be declared to take two arguments, where the first is an {{unsigned long}}.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      getter type identifier(unsigned long identifier);
      setter type identifier(unsigned long identifier, type identifier);

      getter type (unsigned long identifier);
      setter type (unsigned long identifier, type identifier);
    };
</pre>

The following requirements apply to the definitions of indexed property getters and setters:

*   If an [=indexed property getter=] was specified using an [=operation=]
    with an [=identifier=],
    then the value returned when indexing the object with a given [=supported property indices|supported property index=]
    is the value that would be returned by invoking the operation, passing
    the index as its only argument.  If the operation used to declare the indexed property getter
    did not have an identifier, then the interface definition must be accompanied
    by a description of how to <dfn id="dfn-determine-the-value-of-an-indexed-property" export>determine the value of an indexed property</dfn>
    for a given index.
*   If an [=indexed property setter=] was specified using an operation
    with an identifier,
    then the behavior that occurs when indexing the object for property assignment with a given supported property index and value
    is the same as if the operation is invoked, passing
    the index as the first argument and the value as the second argument.  If the operation used to declare the indexed property setter
    did not have an identifier, then the interface definition must be accompanied
    by a description of how to <dfn id="dfn-set-the-value-of-an-existing-indexed-property" export>set the value of an existing indexed property</dfn>
    and how to <dfn id="dfn-set-the-value-of-a-new-indexed-property" export>set the value of a new indexed property</dfn>
    for a given property index and value.

<div class="note">

    Note that if an [=indexed property getter=] or
    [=indexed property setters|setter=]
    is specified using an [=operation=] with an [=identifier=],
    then indexing an object with an integer that is not a [=supported property indices|supported property index=]
    does not necessarily elicit the same behavior as invoking the operation with that index.  The actual behavior in this
    case is language binding specific.

    In the ECMAScript language binding, a regular property lookup is done.  For example, take the following IDL:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          getter DOMString toWord(unsigned long index);
        };
    </pre>

    Assume that an object implementing <code class="idl">A</code> has [=supported property indices=]
    in the range 0 ≤ <var ignore>index</var> &lt; 2.  Also assume that toWord is defined to return
    its argument converted into an English word.  The behavior when invoking the
    [=operation=] with an out of range index
    is different from indexing the object directly:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var a = getA();

        a.toWord(0);  // Evalautes to "zero".
        a[0];         // Also evaluates to "zero".

        a.toWord(5);  // Evaluates to "five".
        a[5];         // Evaluates to undefined, since there is no property "5".
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface
    <code class="idl">OrderedMap</code> which allows
    retrieving and setting values by name or by index number:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface OrderedMap {
          readonly attribute unsigned long size;

          getter any getByIndex(unsigned long index);
          setter undefined setByIndex(unsigned long index, any value);

          getter any get(DOMString name);
          setter undefined set(DOMString name, any value);
        };
    </pre>

    Since all of the special operations are declared using
    operations with identifiers, the only additional prose
    that is necessary is that which describes what keys those sets
    have.  Assuming that the <code>get()</code> operation is
    defined to return <emu-val>null</emu-val> if an
    attempt is made to look up a non-existing entry in the
    <code class="idl">OrderedMap</code>, then the following
    two sentences would suffice:

    <blockquote>

        An object <var ignore>map</var> implementing <code class="idl">OrderedMap</code>
        supports indexed properties with indices in the range
        0 ≤ <var ignore>index</var> &lt; <code>map.size</code>.

        Such objects also support a named property for every name that,
        if passed to <code>get()</code>, would return a non-null value.

    </blockquote>

    As described in [[#es-legacy-platform-objects]],
    an ECMAScript implementation would create
    properties on a [=legacy platform object=] implementing
    <code class="idl">OrderedMap</code> that correspond to
    entries in both the named and indexed property sets.
    These properties can then be used to interact
    with the object in the same way as invoking the object’s
    methods, as demonstrated below:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Assume map is a legacy platform object implementing the OrderedMap interface.
        var map = getOrderedMap();
        var x, y;

        x = map[0];       // If map.length &gt; 0, then this is equivalent to:
                          //
                          //   x = map.getByIndex(0)
                          //
                          // since a property named "0" will have been placed on map.
                          // Otherwise, x will be set to undefined, since there will be
                          // no property named "0" on map.

        map[1] = false;   // This will do the equivalent of:
                          //
                          //   map.setByIndex(1, false)

        y = map.apple;    // If there exists a named property named "apple", then this
                          // will be equivalent to:
                          //
                          //   y = map.get('apple')
                          //
                          // since a property named "apple" will have been placed on
                          // map.  Otherwise, y will be set to undefined, since there
                          // will be no property named "apple" on map.

        map.berry = 123;  // This will do the equivalent of:
                          //
                          //   map.set('berry', 123)

        delete map.cake;  // If a named property named "cake" exists, then the "cake"
                          // property will be deleted, and then the equivalent to the
                          // following will be performed:
                          //
                          //   map.remove("cake")
    </pre>
</div>


<h5 id="idl-named-properties" dfn export>Named properties</h5>

An [=interface=] that defines a [=named property getter=]
is said to <dfn id="dfn-support-named-properties" export>support named properties</dfn>.
By extension, a [=platform object=]
is said to [=support named properties=] if
it implements an [=interface=] that itself does.

If an interface [=support named properties|supports named properties=],
then the interface definition must be accompanied by
a description of the ordered set of names that can be used to index the object
at any given time.  These names are called the
<dfn id="dfn-supported-property-names" export>supported property names</dfn>.

Named property getters and deleters must
be declared to take a single {{DOMString}} argument.
Named property setters must
be declared to take two arguments, where the first is a {{DOMString}}.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      getter type identifier(DOMString identifier);
      setter type identifier(DOMString identifier, type identifier);
      deleter type identifier(DOMString identifier);

      getter type (DOMString identifier);
      setter type (DOMString identifier, type identifier);
      deleter type (DOMString identifier);
    };
</pre>

The following requirements apply to the definitions of named property getters, setters and deleters:

*   If a [=named property getter=] was specified using an [=operation=]
    with an [=identifier=],
    then the value returned when indexing the object with a given [=supported property name=]
    is the value that would be returned by invoking the operation, passing
    the name as its only argument.  If the operation used to declare the named property getter
    did not have an identifier, then the interface definition must be accompanied
    by a description of how to <dfn id="dfn-determine-the-value-of-a-named-property" export>determine the value of a named property</dfn>
    for a given property name.
*   If a [=named property setter=] was specified using an operation
    with an identifier,
    then the behavior that occurs when indexing the object for property assignment with a given supported property name and value
    is the same as if the operation is invoked, passing
    the name as the first argument and the value as the second argument.  If the operation used to declare the named property setter
    did not have an identifier, then the interface definition must be accompanied
    by a description of how to <dfn id="dfn-set-the-value-of-an-existing-named-property" export>set the value of an existing named property</dfn>
    and how to <dfn id="dfn-set-the-value-of-a-new-named-property" export>set the value of a new named property</dfn>
    for a given property name and value.
*   If a [=named property deleter=] was specified using an operation
    with an identifier,
    then the behavior that occurs when indexing the object for property deletion with a given supported property name
    is the same as if the operation is invoked, passing
    the name as the only argument.  If the operation used to declare the named property deleter
    did not have an identifier, then the interface definition must be accompanied
    by a description of how to <dfn id="dfn-delete-an-existing-named-property" export>delete an existing named property</dfn>
    for a given property name.

Note: As with [=indexed properties=],
if an [=named property getter=],
[=named property setters|setter=] or
[=named property deleters|deleter=]
is specified using an [=operation=] with an [=identifier=],
then indexing an object with a name that is not a [=supported property name=]
does not necessarily elicit the same behavior as invoking the operation with that name; the behavior
is language binding specific.


<h4 id="idl-static-attributes-and-operations">Static attributes and operations</h4>

<dfn id="dfn-static-attribute" export>Static attributes</dfn> and
<dfn id="dfn-static-operation" export>static operations</dfn> are ones that
are not associated with a particular instance of the
[=interface=]
on which it is declared, and is instead associated with the interface
itself.  Static attributes and operations are declared by using the
<emu-t>static</emu-t> keyword in their declarations.

It is language binding specific whether it is possible to invoke
a static operation or get or set a static attribute through a reference
to an instance of the interface.

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-StaticMember">
    StaticMember :
        "static" StaticMemberRest
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-StaticMemberRest">
    StaticMemberRest :
        OptionalReadOnly AttributeRest
        RegularOperation
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface
    <code class="idl">Circle</code> that has a static
    operation declared on it:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Point { /* ... */ };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Circle {
          attribute double cx;
          attribute double cy;
          attribute double radius;

          static readonly attribute long triangulationCount;
          static Point triangulate(Circle c1, Circle c2, Circle c3);
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, the [=function object=] for
    <code>triangulate</code> and the accessor property for <code>triangulationCount</code>
    will exist on the [=interface object=]
    for <code class="idl">Circle</code>:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var circles = getCircles();           // an Array of Circle objects

        typeof Circle.triangulate;            // Evaluates to "function"
        typeof Circle.triangulationCount;     // Evaluates to "number"
        Circle.prototype.triangulate;         // Evaluates to undefined
        Circle.prototype.triangulationCount;  // Also evaluates to undefined
        circles[0].triangulate;               // As does this
        circles[0].triangulationCount;        // And this

        // Call the static operation
        var triangulationPoint = Circle.triangulate(circles[0], circles[1], circles[2]);

        // Find out how many triangulations we have done
        window.alert(Circle.triangulationCount);
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="idl-overloading">Overloading</h4>

If a [=regular operation=]
or [=static operation=]
defined on an [=interface=]
has an [=identifier=]
that is the same as the identifier of another operation on that
interface of the same kind (regular or static), then the operation is said to be
<dfn id="dfn-overloaded" export>overloaded</dfn>.  When the identifier
of an overloaded operation is used to invoke one of the
operations on an object that implements the interface, the
number and types of the arguments passed to the operation
determine which of the overloaded operations is actually
invoked.
[=Constructor operations=] can be overloaded too.
There are some restrictions on the arguments
that overloaded operations and constructors can be
specified to take, and in order to describe these restrictions,
the notion of an <em>effective overload set</em> is used.

A set of overloaded [=operations=] must either:

* contain no [=operations=] whose [=return type=] is a [=promise type=];
* only contain [=operations=] whose [=return type=] is a [=promise type=].

[=Operations=] must not be overloaded across
[=interface=],
[=partial interface=],
[=interface mixin=], and
[=partial interface mixin=]
definitions.

<div class="note">

    For example, the overloads for both <var ignore>f</var> and <var ignore>g</var>
    are disallowed:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface A {
          undefined f();
        };

        partial interface A {
          undefined f(double x);
          undefined g();
        };

        partial interface A {
          undefined g(DOMString x);
        };
    </pre>

    Note that [=constructor operations=] and
    [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]
    [=extended attributes=] are disallowed from appearing
    on [=partial interface=] definitions,
    so there is no need to also disallow overloading for constructors.

</div>

An <dfn id="dfn-effective-overload-set" export>effective overload set</dfn>
represents the allowable invocations for a particular
[=operation=],
constructor (specified with a [=constructor operation=]
or [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]), or
[=callback function=].
The algorithm to [=compute the effective overload set=]
operates on one of the following four types of IDL constructs, and listed with them below are
the inputs to the algorithm needed to compute the set.

 :  For regular operations
 :  For static operations
 :: *   the [=interface=] on which the [=operations=] are to be found
    *   the [=identifier=] of the operations
    *   the number of arguments to be passed
 :  For constructors
 :: *   the [=interface=] on which the [=constructor operations=] are to be found
    *   the number of arguments to be passed
 :  For legacy factory functions
 :: *   the [=interface=] on which the [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] [=extended attributes=] are to be found
    *   the [=identifier=] of the legacy factory function
    *   the number of arguments to be passed

An [=effective overload set=] is used, among other things, to determine whether there are
ambiguities in the overloaded operations and constructors specified on an interface.

The [=set/items=] of an [=effective overload set=] are [=tuples=] of the form
([=effective overload set tuple/callable=], [=type list=], [=optionality list=])
whose [=tuple/items=] are described below:

*   A <dfn for="effective overload set tuple">callable</dfn> is an [=operation=]
    if the [=effective overload set=] is for [=regular operations=],
    [=static operations=], or [=constructor operations=]; and it is an [=extended attribute=]
    if the [=effective overload set=] is for [=legacy factory functions=].
*   A <dfn>type list</dfn> is a [=list=] of IDL types.
*   An <dfn>optionality list</dfn> is a [=list=] of
    three possible <dfn id="dfn-optionality-value" export>optionality values</dfn>
    – "required", "optional" or "variadic" –
    indicating whether the argument at a given index was
    declared as being [=optional argument|optional=]
    or corresponds to a [=variadic=] argument.

Each [=tuple=] represents an allowable invocation of the operation,
constructor, or callback function with an argument value list of the given types.
Due to the use of [=optional arguments=]
and [=variadic=] operations
and constructors, there may be multiple items in an [=effective overload set=] identifying
the same operation or constructor.

<div algorithm="compute the effective overload set">
    The algorithm below describes how to <dfn>compute the effective overload set</dfn>.
    The following input variables are used, if they are required:

    *   the identifier of the operation or legacy factory function is |A|
    *   the argument count is |N|
    *   the interface is |I|

    Whenever an argument of an extended attribute is mentioned,

If there is more than one [=list/item=] in an [=effective overload set=]
that has a given [=type list=] [=list/size=],
then for those items there must be an index |i| such that
for each pair of items the types at index |i| are [=distinguishable=].
The lowest such index is termed the <dfn id="dfn-distinguishing-argument-index" export>distinguishing argument index</dfn>
for the items of the [=effective overload set=] with the given type list size.

<p id="limit-bigint-numeric-overloading">An [=effective overload set=] must not contain more than
one [=list/item=] with the same [=type list=] [=list/size=], where one [=list/item=] has a

argument at the [=distinguishing argument index=].

<div class="example">

    Consider the [=effective overload set=] shown in the previous example.
    There are multiple items in the set with type lists 2, 3 and 4.
    For each of these type list size, the [=distinguishing argument index=] is 0, since <code class="idl">Node</code> and
    <code class="idl">Event</code> are [=distinguishable=].

    The following use of overloading however is invalid:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface B {
          undefined f(DOMString x);
          undefined f(USVString x);

    since {{DOMString}} and {{USVString}} are not distinguishable.

In addition, for each index |j|, where |j| is less than the
[=distinguishing argument index=]
for a given type list size, the types at index |j| in
all of the items’ type lists must be the same,
and the [=optionality values=] at index |j| in all of the items’ optionality lists must
be the same.

<div class="example">

    The following is invalid:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface B {
          /* f1 */ undefined f(DOMString w);
          /* f2 */ undefined f(long w, double x, Node y, Node z);
          /* f3 */ undefined f(double w, double x, DOMString y, Node z);
        };

    For argument count 4, the [=effective overload set=] is:

        (f1, « DOMString »,                       « required »),
        (f2, « long, double, Node, Node »,        « required, required, required, required »),
        (f3, « double, double, DOMString, Node », « required, required, required, required »)
      »
    </pre>

    Looking at items with type list size 4, the
    [=distinguishing argument index=]
    is 2, since <code class="idl">Node</code> and
    {{DOMString}} are [=distinguishable=].
    However, since the arguments in these two overloads at index 0 are different,
    the overloading is invalid.

<h5 id="idl-overloading-vs-union">Overloading vs. union types</h5>

<i>This section is informative.</i>

<div class="non-normative">

For specifications defining IDL [=operations=], it might seem that [=overloaded|overloads=] and a
combination of [=union types=] and [=optional arguments=] have some feature overlap.

It is first important to note that [=overloaded|overloads=] have different behaviors than [=union
types=] or [=optional arguments=], and one <em>cannot</em> be fully defined using the other (unless,
of course, additional prose is provided, which can defeat the purpose of the Web IDL type system).
For example, consider the {{CanvasDrawPath/stroke()}} operations defined on the {{CanvasDrawPath}}
interface [[HTML]]:

<pre highlight="webidl">
    interface CanvasDrawPathExcerpt {
      undefined stroke();
      undefined stroke(Path2D path);
    };
</pre>

Per the ECMAScript language binding, calling <code>stroke(undefined)</code> on an object
implementing <code class="idl">CanvasDrawPathExcerpt</code> would attempt to call the second
overload, yielding a {{TypeError}} since <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> cannot be <a
href="#es-to-interface">converted</a> to a {{Path2D}}. However, if the operations were instead
defined with [=optional arguments=] and merged into one,

<pre highlight="webidl">
    interface CanvasDrawPathExcerptOptional {
      undefined stroke(optional Path2D path);
    };
</pre>

the [=overload resolution algorithm=] would treat the <var ignore>path</var> argument as missing
given the same call <code>stroke(undefined)</code>, and not throw any exceptions.

Note: For this particular example, the latter behavior is actually what Web developers would
generally expect. If {{CanvasDrawPath}} were to be designed today, [=optional arguments=] would be
used for <code class="idl">stroke()</code>.

Additionally, there are semantic differences as well. [=Union types=] are usually used in the sense
that "any of the types would work in about the same way". In contrast, [=overloaded=] operations are
designed to map well to language features such as C++ overloading, and are usually a better fit for
operations with more substantial differences in what they do given arguments of different types.
However, in most cases, operations with such substantial differences are best off with different
names to avoid confusion for Web developers, since the ECMAScript language does not provide
language-level overloading. As such, overloads are rarely appropriate for new APIs, instead often
appearing in legacy APIs or in specialized circumstances.

That being said, we offer the following recommendations and examples in case of difficulties to
determine what Web IDL language feature to use:

*   In the unusual case where the operation needs to return values of different types for different
    argument types, [=overloaded|overloading=] will result in more expressive IDL fragments. <span
    class="note">This is almost never appropriate API design, and separate operations with distinct
    names usually are a better choice for such cases.</span>

    Suppose there is an operation <code class="idl">calculate()</code> that accepts a {{long}},
    {{DOMString}}, or <code class="idl">CalculatableInterface</code> (an [=interface type=]) as its
    only argument, and returns a value of the same type as its argument. It would be clearer to
    write the IDL fragment using [=overloaded=] operations as

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface A {
          long calculate(long input);
          DOMString calculate(DOMString input);
          CalculatableInterface calculate(CalculatableInterface input);
        };
    </pre>

    than using a [=union type=] with a [=typedef=] as

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        typedef (long or DOMString or CalculatableInterface) Calculatable;
        interface A {
          Calculatable calculate(Calculatable input);
        };
    </pre>

    which does not convey the fact that the return value is always of the same type as <var
    ignore>input</var>.

    If the specified <code class="idl">calculate()</code> is a new API and does not have any
    compatibility concerns, it is suggested to use different names for the overloaded operations,
    perhaps as

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface A {
          long calculateNumber(long input);
          DOMString calculateString(DOMString input);
          CalculatableInterface calculateCalculatableInterface(CalculatableInterface input);
        };
    </pre>

    which allows Web developers to write explicit and unambiguous code.

*   When the operation has significantly different semantics for different argument types or
    lengths, [=overloaded|overloading=] is preferred. Again, in such scenarios, it is usually better
    to create separate operations with distinct names, but legacy APIs sometimes follow this
    pattern.

    As an example, the {{CSS/supports(property, value)}} and {{CSS/supports(conditionText)}}
    operations of the {{CSS}} interface are defined as the
    following IDL fragment [[CSS3-CONDITIONAL]] [[CSSOM]].

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        partial interface CSS {
          static boolean supports(CSSOMString property, CSSOMString value);
          static boolean supports(CSSOMString conditionText);
        };
    </pre>

    Using [=optional arguments=] one can rewrite the IDL fragment as follows:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        partial interface CSSExcerptOptional {
          static boolean supports(CSSOMString propertyOrConditionText, optional CSSOMString value);
        };
    </pre>

    Even though the IDL is shorter in the second version, two distinctively different concepts are
    conflated in the first argument. Without [=overloaded|overloads=], the question "is <var
    ignore>property</var> or <var ignore>conditionText</var> paired with <var ignore>value</var>?"
    is much more difficult to answer without reading the [=method steps=] of the operation. This
    makes the second version remarkably less readable than the first.

    Another consideration is that the [=method steps=] for [=overloaded=] operations can be
    specified in separate blocks, which can aid in both reading and writing specifications. This is
    not the case for [=optional arguments=]. This means that in the first case the specification
    author can write the [=method steps=] of the operations as:

    <div algorithm="execute supports() with overloads">

        The <code class="idl">supports(<var ignore>property</var>, <var ignore>value</var>)</code>
        method steps are:

        1.  …

        ----

        The <code class="idl">supports(<var ignore>conditionText</var>)</code> method steps are:

        1.  …

    </div>

    Yet using <var ignore>value</var> as an [=optional argument=], the specification author has to
    use more boilerplate-style text to effectively replicate the [=overload resolution algorithm=].

    <div algorithm="execute supports() with optional argument">

        The <code class="idl">supports(|propertyOrConditionText|, |value|)</code> method steps are:

        1.  If |value| is given, then:
            1.  Let <var ignore>property</var> be |propertyOrConditionText|.

    If the two overloads have little to no shared parts, it is better to leave overload resolution
    to the IDL mechanism.

*   If the operation accepts multiple types for multiple arguments with no coupling between types of
    different arguments, [=union types=] can sometimes be the only viable solution.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        typedef (long long or DOMString or CalculatableInterface) SupportedArgument;
        interface A {
          undefined add(SupportedArgument operand1, SupportedArgument operand2);
        };
    </pre>

    For the <code class="idl">add()</code> operation above, to specify it using
    [=overloaded|overloads=] would require

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface A {
          undefined add(long long operand1, long long operand2);
          undefined add(long long operand1, DOMString operand2);
          undefined add(long long operand1, CalculatableInterface operand2);
          undefined add(DOMString operand1, long long operand2);
          undefined add(DOMString operand1, DOMString operand2);
          undefined add(DOMString operand1, CalculatableInterface operand2);
          undefined add(CalculatableInterface operand1, long long operand2);
          undefined add(CalculatableInterface operand1, DOMString operand2);
          undefined add(CalculatableInterface operand1, CalculatableInterface operand2);
        };
    </pre>

    and nine times the corresponding prose!

*   Specification authors are encouraged to treat missing argument and <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>
    argument the same way in the ECMAScript language binding.

    Given the following IDL fragment:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface A {
          undefined foo();
          undefined foo(Node? arg);
        };
    </pre>

    Using the ECMAScript language binding, calling <code>foo(undefined)</code> and
    <code>foo(null)</code> would both run the steps corresponding to the <code
    class="idl">foo(|arg|)</code> operation, with |arg| set to null, while <code>foo()</code> alone
    would go to the first overload. This can be a surprising behavior for many API users. Instead,
    specification authors are encouraged to use an [=optional argument=], which would categorize
    both <code>foo()</code> and <code>foo(undefined)</code> as "|arg| is missing".

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        interface A {
          undefined foo(optional Node? arg);
        };
    </pre>

    In general, optionality is best expressed using the <emu-t>optional</emu-t> keyword, and not
    using overloads.

When the case fits none of the categories above, it is up to the specification author to choose the
style, since it is most likely that either style would sufficiently and conveniently describe the
intended behavior. However, the definition and <a href="#es-to-union">conversion algorithms</a> of
[=union types=] and [=optional arguments=] are simpler to implement and reason about than [=overload
resolution algorithm|those=] of [=overloaded|overloads=], and usually result in more idiomatic APIs
in the ECMAScript language binding. Thus, unless any other considerations apply, [=union types=]
(and/or [=optional arguments=]) are the default choice.

Specifications are also free to mix and match union types and overloads, if the author finds it
appropriate and convenient.

<h4 id="idl-iterable">Iterable declarations</h4>

An [=interface=] can be declared to be
<dfn id="dfn-iterable" export>iterable</dfn> by using an <dfn id="dfn-iterable-declaration" export>iterable declaration</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Iterable">Iterable</a></emu-nt>) in the body of the interface.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      iterable&lt;value_type&gt;;
      iterable&lt;key_type, value_type&gt;;
    };
</pre>

Objects implementing an interface that is declared to be iterable
support being iterated over to obtain a sequence of values.

Note: In the ECMAScript language binding, an interface that is iterable
will have <code class="idl">entries</code>, <code class="idl">forEach</code>,
<code class="idl">keys</code>, <code class="idl">values</code>, and {{@@iterator}}
properties on its [=interface prototype object=].

If a single type parameter is given, then the interface has a
<dfn id="dfn-value-iterator" export>value iterator</dfn> and provides
values of the specified type.
If two type parameters are given, then the interface has a
<dfn id="dfn-pair-iterator" export>pair iterator</dfn> and provides
[=value pairs=] with the given types.

A <dfn>value pair</dfn>, given a key type and a value type, is a [=/struct=] with two
[=struct/items=]:
1.  an [=struct/item=] whose [=struct/name=] is "key", which is referred to as the [=value pair=]'s
    <dfn for="value pair">key</dfn>, and whose value is an IDL value of the key type;
1.  an [=struct/item=] whose [=struct/name=] is "value", which is referred to as the
    [=value pair=]'s <dfn for="value pair">value</dfn>, and whose value is an IDL value of the
    value type.

A [=value iterator=]
must only be declared on an interface
that [=support indexed properties|supports indexed properties=].
The value-type of the [=value iterator=]
must be the same as the type returned by
the [=indexed property getter=].
A [=value iterator=] is implicitly
defined to iterate over the object’s indexed properties.

A [=pair iterator=]
must not be declared on an interface
that [=support indexed properties|supports indexed properties=].

Prose accompanying an [=interface=] with a [=pair iterator=] must define a [=/list=] of
[=value pairs=] for each instance of the [=interface=], which is the list of
<dfn id="dfn-value-pairs-to-iterate-over" export>value pairs to iterate over</dfn>.

<div class="note">

    The ECMAScript forEach method that is generated for a
    [=value iterator=]
    invokes its callback like Array.prototype.forEach does, and the forEach
    method for a [=pair iterator=]
    invokes its callback like Map.prototype.forEach does.

    Since [=value iterators=]
    are currently allowed only on interfaces that
    [=support indexed properties=],
    it makes sense to use an Array-like forEach method.
    There may be a need for [=value iterators=]
    (a) on interfaces that do not
    [=support indexed properties=],
    or (b) with a forEach method that instead invokes its callback like
    Set.prototype.forEach (where the key is the same as the value).
    If you’re creating an API that needs such a forEach method, please
    <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/new?title=Enhancement%20request%20for%20Iterables">file an issue</a>.

</div>

Note: This is how [=array iterator objects=] work.
For interfaces that [=support indexed properties=],
the iterator objects returned by <code class="idl">entries</code>,
<code class="idl">keys</code>, <code class="idl">values</code>, and {{@@iterator}} are
actual [=array iterator objects=].

Interfaces with iterable declarations must not
have any [=interface members=]
named "<code>entries</code>", "<code>forEach</code>",
"<code>keys</code>", or "<code>values</code>",
or have any [=inherited interfaces=]
that have [=members=] with these names.

<div class="example">

    Consider the following interface <code class="idl">SessionManager</code>, which allows access to
    a number of <code class="idl">Session</code> objects keyed by username:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface SessionManager {
          Session getSessionForUser(DOMString username);

          iterable&lt;DOMString, Session&gt;;

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Session {
          readonly attribute DOMString username;
          // ...
        };
    </pre>

    The behavior of the iterator could be defined like so:

    <blockquote>

        The [=value pairs to iterate over=] are the list of [=value pairs=] with the
        [=value pair/key=] being the username and the [=value pair/value=] being the open
        <code class="idl">Session</code> object on the <code class="idl">SessionManager</code>
        object corresponding to that username, sorted by username.

    </blockquote>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, the [=interface prototype object=]
    for the <code class=idl>SessionManager</code> [=interface=]
    has a <code>values</code> method that is a function, which, when invoked,
    returns an iterator object that itself has a <code>next</code> method that returns the
    next value to be iterated over.  It has <code>keys</code> and <code>entries</code>
    methods that iterate over the usernames of session objects
    and username/<code class=idl>Session</code> object pairs, respectively.  It also has
    a {{@@iterator}} method that allows a <code class="idl">SessionManager</code>
    to be used in a <code>for..of</code> loop that has the same value as the
    <code>entries</code> method:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Get an instance of SessionManager.
        // Assume that it has sessions for two users, "anna" and "brian".
        var sm = getSessionManager();

        typeof SessionManager.prototype.values;            // Evaluates to "function"
        var it = sm.values();                              // values() returns an iterator object
        String(it);                                        // Evaluates to "[object SessionManager Iterator]"
        typeof it.next;                                    // Evaluates to "function"

        // This loop will log "anna" and then "brian".
        for (;;) {
          let result = it.next();
          if (result.done) {
            break;
          }
          let session = result.value;
          console.log(session.username);
        }

        // This loop will also log "anna" and then "brian".
        for (let username of sm.keys()) {
          console.log(username);
        }

        // Yet another way of accomplishing the same.
        for (let [username, session] of sm) {
          console.log(username);
        }
    </pre>

An interface must not have more than one

The [=inherited interfaces=]

<h4 id="idl-async-iterable">Asynchronously iterable declarations</h4>

An [=interface=] can be declared to be asynchronously iterable by using an
<dfn id="dfn-async-iterable-declaration" export>asynchronously iterable declaration</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-AsyncIterable">AsyncIterable</a></emu-nt>) in the body of the
[=interface=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    interface interface_identifier {
      async iterable&lt;value_type&gt;;
      async iterable&lt;value_type&gt;(/* arguments... */);
      async iterable&lt;key_type, value_type&gt;;
      async iterable&lt;key_type, value_type&gt;(/* arguments... */);
    };
</pre>

Objects that [=implement=] an [=interface=] that is declared to be asynchronously iterable support
being iterated over asynchronously to obtain a sequence of values.

If a single type parameter is given, then the interface has a
<dfn export>value asynchronously iterable declaration</dfn> and asynchronously provides values of the
specified type. If two type parameters are given, then the interface has a
<dfn export>pair asynchronously iterable declaration</dfn> and asynchronously provides
[=value pairs=] with the given types.

If given, an [=asynchronously iterable declaration=]'s arguments (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentList">ArgumentList</a></emu-nt>) must all be [=optional arguments=].

<div class="note">
    In the ECMAScript language binding, an interface that is asynchronously iterable will have
    {{@@asyncIterator}} and <code class="idl">values</code> properties on its
    [=interface prototype object=]. If the interface has a
    [=pair asynchronously iterable declaration=], it will additionally have
    <code class="idl">entries</code> and <code class="idl">keys</code> properties. All of these
    methods can be passed optional arguments, which correspond to the argument list in the
    [=asynchronously iterable declaration=], and are processed by the
    [=asynchronous iterator initialization steps=], if any exist.

    With this in mind, the requirement that all arguments be optional ensures that, in the
    ECMAScript binding, <code>for</code>-<code>await</code>-<code>of</code> can work directly on
    instances of the interface, since <code>for</code>-<code>await</code>-<code>of</code> calls the
    {{@@asyncIterator}} method with no arguments.
</div>

Prose accompanying an [=interface=] with an [=asynchronously iterable declaration=] must define a
<dfn id="dfn-get-the-next-iteration-result" export>get the next iteration result</dfn> algorithm.
This algorithm receives the instance of the [=interface=] that is being iterated, as well as the
async iterator itself (which can be useful for storing state).
It must return a {{Promise}} that either rejects, resolves with a special <dfn export>end of
iteration</dfn> value to signal the end of the iteration, or resolves with one of the following:

: for [=value asynchronously iterable declarations=]:
::  a value of the type given in the declaration;
: for [=pair asynchronously iterable declarations=]:
::  a [=pair=] containing a value of the first type given in the declaration, and a value of the second type given in the declaration.

The prose may also define an <dfn export>asynchronous iterator return</dfn> algorithm. This
algorithm receives the instance of the [=interface=] that is being iterated, the async iterator
itself, and a single argument value of type {{any}}. This algorithm is invoked in the case of
premature termination of the async iterator. It must return a {{Promise}}; if that promise
fulfills, its fulfillment value will be ignored, but if it rejects, that failure will be passed on
to users of the async iterator API.

<p class="note">In the ECMAScript binding, this algorithm allows customizing the behavior when the
async iterator's <code>return()</code> method is invoked. This most commonly occurs when a
<code>break</code> or <code>return</code> statement causes an exit from a
<code>for</code>-<code>await</code>-<code>of</code> loop.

<p class="note">We could add a similar hook for <code>throw()</code>. So far there has been no need,
but if you are creating an API that needs such capabilities, please
<a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/new?title=Enhancement%20request%20for%20Async%20Iterables">file an issue</a>.

The prose may also define <dfn export>asynchronous iterator initialization steps</dfn>. These
receive the instance of the [=interface=] being iterated, the newly-created iterator object, and a
[=list=] of IDL values representing the arguments passed, if any.

[=Interfaces=] with an [=asynchronously iterable declaration=] must not have any
[=interface members=] named "<code>entries</code>", "<code>keys</code>", or "<code>values</code>",
or have any [=inherited interfaces=] that have [=interface members=] with these names.

            Note: |iterator|'s [=SessionManager async iterator/current state=] might no longer be

Maplike interfaces support an API for querying the map entries

the map entries.

Note: In the ECMAScript language binding, the API for interacting

For read–write maplikes, it also includes <code class="idl">clear</code>,

Maplike interfaces must not

Note: Operations named "<code>clear</code>", "<code>delete</code>",

This allows the default behavior of these operations to be overridden.

Note: In the ECMAScript language binding, the API for interacting
with the set entries is similar to that available on ECMAScript
{{ECMAScript/Set}} objects.  If the <emu-t>readonly</emu-t>
keyword is used, this includes <code class="idl">entries</code>,
<code class="idl">forEach</code>, <code class="idl">has</code>,
<code class="idl">keys</code>, <code class="idl">values</code>,
{{@@iterator}} methods, and a <code class="idl">size</code> getter.
For read–write setlikes, it also includes <code class="idl">add</code>,
<code class="idl">clear</code>, and <code class="idl">delete</code> methods.

Setlike interfaces must not
have any [=interface members=]
named "<code>entries</code>", "<code>forEach</code>",
"<code>has</code>", "<code>keys</code>",
"<code>size</code>", or "<code>values</code>",
or have any [=inherited interfaces=]
that have [=members=] with these names.
Read–write setlike interfaces must not
have any [=attributes=]
or [=constants=] named
"<code>add</code>", "<code>clear</code>",
or "<code>delete</code>", or have any [=inherited interfaces=]
that have [=attributes=] or [=constants=] with these names.

Note: Operations named "<code>add</code>", "<code>clear</code>",
or "<code>delete</code>" are allowed on read–write setlike
interfaces and will prevent the default implementation of these methods being
added to the interface prototype object in the ECMAScript language binding.
This allows the default behavior of these operations to be overridden.

An interface must not have more than one
[=setlike declaration=].
The [=inherited interfaces=]
of a setlike interface must not
also have a [=setlike declaration=].
A setlike interface and its [=inherited interfaces=]
must not have an
[=iterable declaration=],
an [=asynchronously iterable declaration=],
a [=maplike declaration=], or
an [=indexed property getter=].

<h3 id="idl-namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

A <dfn id="dfn-namespace" export>namespace</dfn> is a definition (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Namespace">Namespace</a></emu-nt>) that declares a global singleton with
associated behaviors.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    namespace identifier {
      /* namespace_members... */
    };
</pre>

A namespace is a specification of a set of
<dfn id="dfn-namespace-member" export lt="namespace member">namespace members</dfn>
(matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-NamespaceMembers">NamespaceMembers</a></emu-nt>), which are the
[=regular operations=] and [=read only=] [=regular attributes=] that appear between the braces in
the namespace declaration. These operations and attributes describe the behaviors packaged into the
namespace.

As with interfaces, the IDL for namespaces can be split into multiple parts by using
<dfn id="dfn-partial-namespace" export>partial namespace</dfn> definitions
(matching <emu-t>partial</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Namespace">Namespace</a></emu-nt>). The [=identifier=] of a partial namespace definition must be the same as the identifier of a namespace definition.
All of the members that appear on each of the partial namespace definitions are
considered to be members of the namespace itself.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    namespace <mark>SomeNamespace</mark> {
      /* namespace_members... */
    };

    partial namespace <mark>SomeNamespace</mark> {
      /* namespace_members... */
    };
</pre>

Note: As with partial interface definitions, partial namespace definitions are intended for
use as a specification editorial aide, allowing the definition of a namespace to be
separated over more than one section of the document, and sometimes multiple
documents.

The order that members appear in has significance for property enumeration in the <a href="#es-namespaces">ECMAScript binding</a>.

Note that unlike interfaces or dictionaries, namespaces do not create types.

Of the extended attributes defined in this specification, only the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}], [{{Exposed}}], and [{{SecureContext}}] extended attributes are applicable to namespaces.

[=Namespaces=] must be annotated with the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=].

    An ECMAScript implementation would then expose a global <code class="idl">VectorUtils</code>

    {{%Object.prototype%}}) with enumerable data properties for each declared operation, and
    enumerable get-only accessors for each declared attribute:

    </pre>
</div>


<h3 id="idl-dictionaries">Dictionaries</h3>

A <dfn id="dfn-dictionary" export>dictionary</dfn> is a definition (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Dictionary">Dictionary</a></emu-nt>)
used to define an [=ordered map=] data type with a fixed, ordered set of [=map/entries=],
termed <dfn id="dfn-dictionary-member" export>dictionary members</dfn>,
where [=map/keys=] are strings and [=map/values=] are of a particular type specified in the definition.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary identifier {
      /* dictionary_members... */
    };
</pre>

Dictionary instances do not retain a reference to their language-specific representations (e.g.,
the corresponding ECMAScript object). So for example, returning a dictionary from an [=operation=]
will result in a new ECMAScript object being created from the current values of the dictionary. And,
an operation that accepts a dictionary as an argument will perform a one-time conversion from the
given ECMAScript value into the dictionary, based on the current properties of the ECMAScript
object. Modifications to the dictionary will not be reflected in the corresponding ECMAScript
object, and vice-versa.

Dictionaries must not be used as the type of an [=attribute=] or [=constant=].

A dictionary can be defined to <dfn id="dfn-inherit-dictionary" for="dictionary" export>inherit</dfn> from another dictionary.
If the identifier of the dictionary is followed by a colon and a [=identifier=],
then that identifier identifies the inherited dictionary.  The identifier
must identify a dictionary.

A dictionary must not be declared such that
its inheritance hierarchy has a cycle.  That is, a dictionary
|A| cannot inherit from itself, nor can it inherit from another
dictionary |B| that inherits from |A|, and so on.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary <mark>Base</mark> {
      /* dictionary_members... */
    };

    dictionary Derived : <mark>Base</mark> {
      /* dictionary_members... */
    };
</pre>

The <dfn id="dfn-inherited-dictionaries" export>inherited dictionaries</dfn> of
a given dictionary |D| is the set of all dictionaries that |D|
inherits from, directly or indirectly.  If |D| does not [=dictionary/inherit=]
from another dictionary, then the set is empty.  Otherwise, the set
includes the dictionary |E| that |D| [=interface/inherits=]
from and all of |E|’s [=inherited dictionaries=].

[=Dictionary members=] can be specified as
<dfn id="required-dictionary-member" export for="dictionary member">required</dfn>, meaning that
converting a language-specific value to a dictionary requires providing a value for that member. Any
dictionary member that is not [=dictionary member/required=] is
<dfn export for="dictionary member">optional</dfn>.

Note that specifying [=dictionary members=] as [=dictionary member/required=] only has
an observable effect when converting other representations of dictionaries (like an ECMAScript value
supplied as an argument to an [=operation=]) to an IDL dictionary. Specification authors should
leave the members [=dictionary member/optional=] in all other cases, including when a dictionary
type is used solely as the [=return type=] of [=operations=].

[=dictionary member/Optional=] [=dictionary members=] can also be specified as having a
<dfn id="dfn-dictionary-member-default-value" for="dictionary member" export>default value</dfn>,
which is the value used by default when author code or specification text does not provide a value
for that member.

A given dictionary value of type |D| can have [=map/entries=] for each of the dictionary members
defined on |D| and on any of |D|’s [=inherited dictionaries=]. Dictionary members that are specified
as [=dictionary member/required=], or that are specified as having a
[=dictionary member/default value=], will always have such corresponding [=map/entries=]. Other
members' entries might or might not [=map/exist=] in the dictionary value.

<p class="note">
    In the ECMAScript binding, a value of <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> for the property
    corresponding to a [=dictionary member=] is treated the same as omitting that property. Thus, it
    will cause an error if the member is [=dictionary member/required=], or will trigger the
    [=dictionary member/default value=] if one is present, or will result in no [=map/entry=]
    existing in the dictionary value otherwise.
</p>

<p class="advisement">
    As with [=optional argument/default value|operation argument default values=], it is strongly
    encouraged not to use <emu-val>true</emu-val> as the [=dictionary member/default value=] for
    {{boolean}}-typed [=dictionary members=], as this can be confusing for authors who might
    otherwise expect the default conversion of <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> to be used (i.e.,
    <emu-val>false</emu-val>). [[API-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]]
</p>

An [=ordered map=] with string [=map/keys=] can be implicitly treated as a dictionary value of a
specific dictionary |D| if all of its [=map/entries=] correspond to [=dictionary members=], as long
as those entries have the correct types, and there are [=map/entries=] present for any
[=dictionary member/required=] or [=dictionary member/default value|defaulted=] dictionary members.

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="webidl">
    dictionary Descriptor {
      DOMString name;
      sequence&lt;unsigned long> serviceIdentifiers;
    };
    </pre>

    A <code>Descriptor</code> dictionary could be created as in the following steps:

    1.  Let |identifiers| be « 1, 3, 7 ».
    1.  Return «[ "name" → "test", "serviceIdentifiers" → |identifiers| ]».
</div>

Each [=dictionary member=] (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-DictionaryMember">DictionaryMember</a></emu-nt>) is specified
as a type (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>) followed by an
[=identifier=]
(given by an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token following
the type).  The identifier is the key name of the key–value pair.
If the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>
is an [=identifier=]
followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>, then the identifier
must identify an
[=interface=], [=enumeration=],
[=callback function=], [=callback interface=] or [=typedef=].
If the dictionary member type is an identifier
not followed by <emu-t>?</emu-t>, then the identifier must
identify any one of those definitions or a [=dictionary=].

If the type of the [=dictionary member=], after resolving typedefs,
is a [=nullable type=],
its [=nullable types/inner type=] must not be a [=dictionary type=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary identifier {
      type identifier;
    };
</pre>

If the identifier is followed by a <span class="char">U+003D EQUALS SIGN ("=")</span>
and a value (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-DefaultValue">DefaultValue</a></emu-nt>),
then that gives the dictionary member its [=dictionary member/default value=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary identifier {
      type identifier = "value";
    };
</pre>

When a boolean literal token (<emu-t>true</emu-t> or <emu-t>false</emu-t>),
the <emu-t>null</emu-t> token,
an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> token, a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t> token,
one of the three special floating point literal values (<emu-t>Infinity</emu-t>,
<emu-t>-Infinity</emu-t> or <emu-t>NaN</emu-t>),
a <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> token, the two
token sequence <emu-t>[]</emu-t>, or the two token sequence <emu-t>{}</emu-t> is
used as the
[=dictionary member/default value=],
it is interpreted in the same way as for an [=operation=]’s
[=optional argument/default value|optional argument default value=].

If the type of the [=dictionary member=]
is an [=enumeration=], then its
[=dictionary member/default value=] if specified must
be one of the [=enumeration values|enumeration’s values=].

If the type of the dictionary member is preceded by the
<emu-t>required</emu-t> keyword, the member is considered a [=dictionary member/required=]
[=dictionary member=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary identifier {
      required type identifier;
    };
</pre>

The type of a dictionary member must not include
the dictionary it appears on.  A type includes a dictionary |D|
if at least one of the following is true:

*   the type is |D|
*   the type is a dictionary that [=dictionary/inherits=] from |D|
*   the type is a [=nullable type=]
    whose [=nullable types/inner type=] includes |D|
*   the type is a [=sequence type=] or [=frozen array type|frozen array=]
    whose element type includes |D|
*   the type is a [=union type=],
    one of whose [=member types=]
    includes |D|
*   the type is a dictionary, one of whose members or inherited members has
    a type that includes |D|
*   the type is <code class="idl">[=record=]&lt;|K|, |V|></code> where |V| includes |D|

As with interfaces, the IDL for dictionaries can be split into multiple parts
by using <dfn id="dfn-partial-dictionary" export>partial dictionary</dfn> definitions
(matching <emu-t>partial</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Dictionary">Dictionary</a></emu-nt>).
The [=identifier=] of a partial
dictionary definition must be the same as the
identifier of a dictionary definition.  All of the members that appear on each
of the partial dictionary definitions are considered to be members of
the dictionary itself.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
    dictionary <mark>SomeDictionary</mark> {
      /* dictionary_members... */
    };

    partial dictionary <mark>SomeDictionary</mark> {
      /* dictionary_members... */
    };
</pre>

Note: As with partial interface definitions, partial dictionary definitions are intended for use as a specification
editorial aide, allowing the definition of an interface to be separated
over more than one section of the document, and sometimes multiple documents.

The order of the [=dictionary members=]
on a given dictionary is such that inherited dictionary members are ordered
before non-inherited members, and the dictionary members on the one
dictionary definition (including any partial dictionary definitions) are
ordered lexicographically by the Unicode codepoints that comprise their
identifiers.

<div class="note">

    For example, with the following definitions:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        dictionary B : A {
          long b;
          long a;
        };

        dictionary A {
          long c;
          long g;
        };

        dictionary C : B {
          long e;
          long f;
        };

        partial dictionary A {
          long h;
          long d;
        };
    </pre>

    the order of the [=dictionary members=]
    of a dictionary value of type <code class="idl">C</code> is
    c, d, g, h, a, b, e, f.

    Dictionaries are required to have their members ordered because
    in some language bindings the behavior observed when passing
    a dictionary value to a platform object depends on the order
    the dictionary members are fetched.  For example, consider the
    following additional interface:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Something {
          undefined f(A a);
        };
    </pre>

    and this ECMAScript code:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var something = getSomething();  // Get an instance of Something.
        var x = 0;

        var dict = { };
        Object.defineProperty(dict, "d", { get: function() { return ++x; } });
        Object.defineProperty(dict, "c", { get: function() { return ++x; } });

        something.f(dict);
    </pre>

    The order that the dictionary members are fetched in determines
    what values they will be taken to have.  Since the order for
    <code class="idl">A</code> is defined to be c then d,
    the value for c will be 1 and the value for d will be 2.

</div>

The identifier of a dictionary member must not be
the same as that of another dictionary member defined on the dictionary or
on that dictionary’s [=inherited dictionaries=].

No [=extended attributes=] are applicable to dictionaries.

<div class="example">

    One use of dictionary types is to allow a number of optional arguments to
    an [=operation=] without being
    constrained as to the order they are specified at the call site.  For example,
    consider the following [=IDL fragment=]:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Point {
          constructor();
          attribute double x;
          attribute double y;
        };

        dictionary PaintOptions {
          DOMString? fillPattern = "black";
          DOMString? strokePattern = null;
          Point position;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface GraphicsContext {
          undefined drawRectangle(double width, double height, optional PaintOptions options);
        };
    </pre>

    In an ECMAScript implementation of the IDL, an Object
    can be passed in for the optional <code class="idl">PaintOptions</code> dictionary:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Get an instance of GraphicsContext.
        var ctx = getGraphicsContext();

        // Draw a rectangle.
        ctx.drawRectangle(300, 200, { fillPattern: "red", position: new Point(10, 10) });
    </pre>

    Both fillPattern and strokePattern are given [=dictionary member/default values=],
    so if they are omitted, the definition of drawRectangle can assume that they
    have the given default values and not include explicit wording to handle
    their non-presence.

</div>


<h3 id="idl-exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

An <dfn id="dfn-exception" export>exception</dfn> is a type of object that
represents an error and which can be thrown or treated as a first
class value by implementations.  Web IDL does not allow exceptions
to be defined, but instead has a number of pre-defined exceptions
that specifications can reference and throw in their definition of
operations, attributes, and so on.  Exceptions have an
<dfn id="dfn-exception-error-name" for="exception" export>error name</dfn>,
a {{DOMString}},
which is the type of error the exception represents, and a
<dfn id="dfn-exception-message" for="exception" export>message</dfn>, which is an optional,
user agent-defined value that provides human readable details of the error.

There are two kinds of exceptions available to be thrown from specifications.
The first is a <dfn id="dfn-simple-exception" export>simple exception</dfn>, which
is identified by one of the following types:

*   <dfn exception>EvalError</dfn>
*   <dfn exception>RangeError</dfn>
*   <dfn exception>ReferenceError</dfn>
*   <dfn exception>TypeError</dfn>
*   <dfn exception>URIError</dfn>

These correspond to all of the ECMAScript [=ECMAScript/error objects=]
(apart from {{ECMAScript/SyntaxError}} and {{ECMAScript/Error}},
which are deliberately omitted as they are reserved for use
by the ECMAScript parser and by authors, respectively).
The meaning of each [=simple exception=] matches
its corresponding error object in the
ECMAScript specification.

The second kind of exception is a {{DOMException}},
which is an exception that encapsulates a name and an optional integer code,
for compatibility with historically defined exceptions in the DOM.

For [=simple exceptions=], the [=error name=] is the type of the exception.
For a {{DOMException}}, the [=error name=] must be one of the names
listed in the [=error names table=] below.
The table also indicates the {{DOMException}}'s integer code for that error name,
if it has one.

Note: As {{DOMException}} is an [=interface type=], it can be used as a type in IDL.
This allows for example an [=operation=]
to be declared to have a {{DOMException}}
[=return type=].

[=Simple exceptions=] can be <dfn id="dfn-create-exception" for="exception" export>created</dfn>
by providing their [=error name=].
A {{DOMException}} can be [=created=]
by providing its [=error name=] followed by {{DOMException}}.
Exceptions can also be <dfn id="dfn-throw" for="exception" export lt="throw">thrown</dfn>, by providing the
same details required to [=created|create=] one.

The resulting behavior from creating and throwing an exception is language binding-specific.

Note: See [[#es-creating-throwing-exceptions]] for details on what creating and throwing an exception
entails in the ECMAScript language binding.

<div class="example">

    Here is are some examples of wording to use to create and throw exceptions.
    To throw a new [=simple exception=] named {{TypeError}}:

    <blockquote>
        [=exception/Throw=] a {{TypeError}}.
    </blockquote>

    To throw a new {{DOMException}} with [=error name=] "{{NotAllowedError!!exception}}":

    <blockquote>
        [=exception/Throw=] an "{{NotAllowedError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}}.
    </blockquote>

    To create a new {{DOMException}} with [=error name=] "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}":

    <blockquote>
        Let <var ignore>object</var> be a newly [=created=] "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}}.
    </blockquote>
</div>


<h4 id="idl-DOMException-error-names">Error names</h4>

    The {{DOMException}} names marked as deprecated are kept for legacy purposes but their usage is discouraged.

Note: If an error name is not listed here, please file a bug as indicated at the top of this specification and it will be addressed shortly. Thanks!

Note: Don't confuse the "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} defined here
with ECMAScript's {{ECMAScript/SyntaxError}}.
"{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} is used to report parsing errors in web APIs,
for example when parsing selectors,
while the ECMAScript {{ECMAScript/SyntaxError}} is reserved for the ECMAScript parser.
To help disambiguate this further,
always favor the "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} notation

<h3 id="idl-enums">Enumerations</h3>

An <dfn id="dfn-enumeration" export>enumeration</dfn> is a definition (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Enum">Enum</a></emu-nt>) used to declare a type
whose valid values are a set of predefined strings.  Enumerations
can be used to restrict the possible
{{DOMString}} values that can be assigned to an
[=attribute=] or passed to an
[=operation=].

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">enum identifier { "enum", "values" /* , ... */ };</pre>

The <dfn id="dfn-enumeration-value" export lt="enumeration value">enumeration values</dfn> are specified
as a comma-separated list of <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> literals.
The list of [=enumeration values=]
must not include duplicates.

<p class="advisement">
    It is strongly suggested that enumeration values be all lowercase,
    and that multiple words be separated using dashes or not be
    separated at all, unless there is a specific reason to use another
    value naming scheme.  For example, an enumeration value that
    indicates an object should be created could be named
    "<code>createobject</code>" or "<code>create-object</code>".
    Consider related uses of enumeration values when deciding whether
    to dash-separate or not separate enumeration value words so that
    similar APIs are consistent.
</p>

The behavior when a string value that is not one a valid enumeration value
is used when assigning to an [=attribute=],
or passed as an [=operation=] argument,
whose type is the enumeration, is language binding specific.

Note: In the ECMAScript binding, assignment of an invalid string value to an
[=attribute=] is ignored, while
passing such a value in other contexts (for example as an [=operation=] argument)
results in an exception being thrown.

No [=extended attributes=]
defined in this specification are applicable to [=enumerations=].

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-Enum">
    Enum :
        "enum" identifier "{" EnumValueList "}" ";"
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-EnumValueList">
    EnumValueList :
        string EnumValueListComma
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-EnumValueListComma">
    EnumValueListComma :
        "," EnumValueListString
        ε
</pre>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-EnumValueListString">
    EnumValueListString :
        string EnumValueListComma
        ε
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an [=enumeration=]
    that is used as the type of an [=attribute=]
    and an [=operation=] argument:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        enum MealType { "rice", "noodles", "other" };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Meal {
          attribute MealType type;
          attribute double size;     // in grams

          undefined initialize(MealType type, double size);
        };
    </pre>

    An ECMAScript implementation would restrict the strings that can be
    assigned to the type property or passed to the initializeMeal function
    to those identified in the [=enumeration=].

    <pre highlight="js">
        var meal = getMeal();                // Get an instance of Meal.

        meal.initialize("rice", 200);        // Operation invoked as normal.

        try {
          meal.initialize("sandwich", 100);  // Throws a TypeError.
        } catch (e) {
        }

        meal.type = "noodles";               // Attribute assigned as normal.
        meal.type = "dumplings";             // Attribute assignment ignored.
        meal.type == "noodles";              // Evaluates to true.
    </pre>

<h3 id="idl-callback-functions">Callback functions</h3>

<p class="issue">
    The “Custom DOM Elements” spec wants to use callback function types for
    platform object provided functions.  Should we rename “callback functions” to
    just “functions” to make it clear that they can be used for both purposes?
</p>

A <dfn id="dfn-callback-function" export>callback function</dfn> is a definition (matching
<emu-t>callback</emu-t> <emu-nt><a href="#prod-CallbackRest">CallbackRest</a></emu-nt>) used to declare a function type.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">callback identifier = return_type (/* arguments... */);</pre>

Note: See also the similarly named [=callback interfaces=].

The [=identifier=] on the
left of the equals sign gives the name of the [=callback function=]
and the return type and argument list (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt>
and <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ArgumentList">ArgumentList</a></emu-nt>) on the right side of the equals
sign gives the signature of the callback function type.

[=Callback functions=] must not
be used as the type of a [=constant=].

The following extended attribute is applicable to callback functions:
[{{LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull}}].

<div data-fill-with="grammar-CallbackOrInterfaceOrMixin"></div>

<div data-fill-with="grammar-CallbackRestOrInterfaceOrMixin"></div>

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-CallbackRest">
    CallbackRest :
        identifier "=" Type "(" ArgumentList ")" ";"
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines
    a [=callback function=] used for an API that
    invokes a user-defined function when an operation is complete.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        callback AsyncOperationCallback = undefined (DOMString status);

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface AsyncOperations {
          undefined performOperation(AsyncOperationCallback whenFinished);
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, a [=function object=] is
    passed as the operation argument.

    <pre highlight="js">
        var ops = getAsyncOperations();  // Get an instance of AsyncOperations.

        ops.performOperation(function(status) {
          window.alert("Operation finished, status is " + status + ".");
        });
    </pre>
</div>


<h3 id="idl-typedefs">Typedefs</h3>

A <dfn id="dfn-typedef" export>typedef</dfn> is a definition (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Typedef">Typedef</a></emu-nt>)
used to declare a new name for a type.  This new name is not exposed
by language bindings; it is purely used as a shorthand for referencing
the type in the IDL.

<pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">typedef type identifier;</pre>

The <dfn>type being given a new name</dfn> is specified after the <emu-t>typedef</emu-t>
keyword (matching <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">TypeWithExtendedAttributes</a></emu-nt>), and the
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> token following the
type gives the name.

The <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Type">Type</a></emu-nt> must not
be the identifier of the same or another [=typedef=].

No [=extended attributes=]
defined in this specification are applicable to [=typedefs=].

<pre class="grammar" id="prod-Typedef">
    Typedef :
        "typedef" TypeWithExtendedAttributes identifier ";"
</pre>

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    demonstrates the use of [=typedefs=]
    to allow the use of a short
    [=identifier=] instead of a long
    [=sequence type=].

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Point {
          attribute double x;
          attribute double y;
        };

        typedef sequence&lt;Point&gt; Points;

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Widget {
          boolean pointWithinBounds(Point p);
          boolean allPointsWithinBounds(Points ps);
        };
    </pre>
</div>


<h3 id="idl-objects">Objects implementing interfaces</h3>

In a given implementation of a set of [=IDL fragments=],
an object can be described as being a [=platform object=].

<dfn id="dfn-platform-object" lt="platform object" export>Platform objects</dfn> are objects
that implement an [=interface=].

<dfn id="dfn-legacy-platform-object" export>Legacy platform objects</dfn> are
[=platform objects=] that implement an [=interface=] which
does not have a [{{Global}}] [=extended attribute=], and which
[=support indexed properties|supports indexed properties=],
[=support named properties|named properties=], or both.

In a browser, for example,
the browser-implemented DOM objects (implementing interfaces such as <code class="idl">Node</code> and
<code class="idl">Document</code>) that provide access to a web page’s contents
to ECMAScript running in the page would be [=platform objects=].  These objects might be exotic objects,
implemented in a language like C++, or they might be native ECMAScript objects.  Regardless,
an implementation of a given set of IDL fragments needs to be able to recognize all [=platform objects=]
that are created by the implementation.  This might be done by having some internal state that records whether
a given object is indeed a platform object for that implementation, or perhaps by observing
that the object is implemented by a given internal C++ class.  How exactly platform objects
are recognized by a given implementation of a set of IDL fragments is implementation specific.

All other objects in the system would not be treated as platform objects.  For example, assume that
a web page opened in a browser loads an ECMAScript library that implements DOM Core.  This library
would be considered to be a different implementation from the browser provided implementation.
The objects created by the ECMAScript library that implement the <code class="idl">Node</code> interface
will not be treated as platform objects that implement <code class="idl">Node</code> by the browser implementation.

[=Callback interfaces=], on the other hand, can be implemented by any ECMAScript object. This
allows Web APIs to invoke author-defined operations. For example, the DOM Events implementation
allows authors to register callbacks by providing objects that implement the
{{EventListener}} interface.


<h3 id="idl-types">Types</h3>

This section lists the types supported by Web IDL, the set of values
corresponding to each type, and how [=constants=]
of that type are represented.

The following types are known as <dfn id="dfn-integer-type" export>integer types</dfn>:
{{byte}},
{{octet}},
{{short}},
{{unsigned short}},
{{long}},
{{unsigned long}},
{{long long}} and
{{unsigned long long}}.

The following types are known as <dfn id="dfn-numeric-type" export>numeric types</dfn>:
the [=integer types=],
{{float}},
{{unrestricted float}},
{{double}} and
{{unrestricted double}}.

The <dfn id="dfn-primitive-type" export>primitive types</dfn> are
{{bigint}}, {{boolean}} and the [=numeric types=].

The <dfn id="dfn-string-type" export>string types</dfn> are
{{DOMString}}, all [=enumeration types=],
{{ByteString}} and {{USVString}}.

The <dfn id="dfn-typed-array-type" export>typed array types</dfn> are
{{Int8Array}},
{{Int16Array}},
{{Int32Array}},
{{Uint8Array}},
{{Uint16Array}},
{{Uint32Array}},
{{Uint8ClampedArray}},
{{Float32Array}} and
{{Float64Array}}.

The <dfn id="dfn-buffer-source-type" export>buffer source types</dfn>
are {{ArrayBuffer}},
{{DataView}},
and the [=typed array types=].

The {{object}} type,
all [=interface types=], and
all [=callback interface types=]
are known as <dfn id="dfn-object-type" export>object types</dfn>.

Every type has a <dfn id="dfn-type-name" export>type name</dfn>, which
is a string, not necessarily unique, that identifies the type.
Each sub-section below defines what the type name is for each
type.

<p id="type-conversion-exceptions">
    When conversions are made from language binding specific types to
    IDL types in order to invoke an [=operation=]
    or assign a value to an [=attribute=],
    all conversions necessary will be performed before the
    specified functionality of the operation or attribute assignment
    is carried out.  If the conversion cannot
    be performed, then the operation will not run or
    the attribute will not be updated.  In some language bindings,
    type conversions could result in an exception being thrown.
    In such cases, these exceptions will be propagated to the
    code that made the attempt to invoke the operation or
    assign to the attribute.

<h4 oldids="dom-any" id="idl-any" interface>any</h4>

The {{any}} type is the union of all other possible
non-[=union type|union=] types.
Its [=type name=] is "<code>Any</code>".

The {{any}} type is like
a discriminated union type, in that each of its values has a
specific non-{{any}} type
associated with it.  For example, one value of the
{{any}} type is the
{{unsigned long}}
150, while another is the {{long}} 150.
These are distinct values.

The particular type of an {{any}}
value is known as its <dfn id="dfn-specific-type" export>specific type</dfn>.
(Values of [=union types=] also have
[=specific types=].)

<h4 id="idl-undefined" oldids="idl-void" interface>undefined</h4>

The {{undefined}} type has a unique value.

{{undefined}} must not be used as the type of an argument in any circumstance
(in an [=operation=], [=callback function=], [=constructor operation=], etc),
or as the type of a [=dictionary member=],
whether directly or in a union.
Instead, use an [=optional argument=]
or a non-[=dictionary member/required=] [=dictionary member=].

Note: This value was previously spelled <code>void</code>,
and more limited in how it was allowed to be used.


<h4 oldids="dom-boolean" id="idl-boolean" interface>boolean</h4>

The {{boolean}} type has two values:
<code class="idl">true</code> and <code class="idl">false</code>.

tokens.

The [=type name=] of the
{{unsigned long long}} type is "<code>UnsignedLongLong</code>".


<h4 oldids="dom-float" id="idl-float" interface>float</h4>

The {{float}} type is a floating point numeric
type that corresponds to the set of finite single-precision 32 bit
IEEE 754 floating point numbers. [[!IEEE-754]]

{{float}} constant values in IDL are
represented with <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t>
tokens.

The [=type name=] of the
{{float}} type is "<code>Float</code>".

<p class="advisement">
    Unless there are specific reasons to use a 32 bit floating point type,
    specifications should use
    {{double}} rather than {{float}},
    since the set of values that a {{double}} can
    represent more closely matches an ECMAScript Number.
</p>


<h4 oldids="dom-unrestrictedfloat" id="idl-unrestricted-float" interface>unrestricted float</h4>

The {{unrestricted float}} type is a floating point numeric
type that corresponds to the set of all possible single-precision 32 bit
IEEE 754 floating point numbers, finite, non-finite, and special "not a number" values (NaNs). [[!IEEE-754]]

{{unrestricted float}} constant values in IDL are
represented with <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t>
tokens.

The [=type name=] of the
{{unrestricted float}} type is "<code>UnrestrictedFloat</code>".


<h4 oldids="dom-double" id="idl-double" interface>double</h4>

The {{double}} type is a floating point numeric
type that corresponds to the set of finite double-precision 64 bit
IEEE 754 floating point numbers. [[!IEEE-754]]

{{double}} constant values in IDL are
represented with <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t>
tokens.

The [=type name=] of the
{{double}} type is "<code>Double</code>".


<h4 oldids="dom-unrestricteddouble" id="idl-unrestricted-double" interface>unrestricted double</h4>

The {{unrestricted double}} type is a floating point numeric
type that corresponds to the set of all possible double-precision 64 bit
IEEE 754 floating point numbers, finite, non-finite, and special "not a number" values (NaNs). [[!IEEE-754]]

{{unrestricted double}} constant values in IDL are
represented with <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-decimal">decimal</a></emu-t>
tokens.

The [=type name=] of the
{{unrestricted double}} type is "<code>UnrestrictedDouble</code>".


<h4 id="idl-bigint" interface>bigint</h4>

The {{bigint}} type is an arbitrary integer type, unrestricted in range.

{{bigint}} constant values in IDL are represented with
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t> tokens.

The [=type name=] of the {{bigint}} type is “<code>BigInt</code>”.


<h4 oldids="dom-DOMString" id="idl-DOMString" interface>DOMString</h4>

The {{DOMString}} type corresponds to
the set of all possible sequences of [=code units=].
Such sequences are commonly interpreted as UTF-16 encoded strings [[!RFC2781]]
although this is not required.
While {{DOMString}} is defined to be
an OMG IDL boxed [=sequence type|sequence=]&lt;{{unsigned short}}&gt; valuetype
in [[DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE/core#ID-C74D1578|DOM Level 3 Core §The DOMString Type]],
this document defines {{DOMString}} to be an intrinsic type
so as to avoid special casing that sequence type
in various situations where a string is required.

Note: Note also that <emu-val>null</emu-val>
is not a value of type {{DOMString}}.
To allow <emu-val>null</emu-val>, a
[=nullable type|nullable=] {{DOMString}},
written as <code>DOMString?</code> in IDL, needs to be used.

Nothing in this specification requires a {{DOMString}}
value to be a valid UTF-16 string.  For example, a {{DOMString}}
value might include unmatched surrogate pair characters.  However, authors
of specifications using Web IDL might want to obtain a sequence of
[=Unicode scalar values=] given a particular sequence of
[=code units=].

There is no way to represent a constant {{DOMString}}
value in IDL, although {{DOMString}} [=dictionary member=] [=dictionary member/default values=]
and [=optional argument|operation optional argument=] [=optional argument/default values=]
can be set to [=value of string literal tokens|the value=] of a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> literal.

The [=type name=] of the
{{DOMString}} type is "<code>String</code>".


<h4 oldids="dom-ByteString" id="idl-ByteString" interface>ByteString</h4>

The {{ByteString}} type
corresponds to the set of all possible sequences of bytes.
Such sequences might be interpreted as UTF-8 encoded strings [[!RFC3629]]
or strings in some other 8-bit-per-code-unit encoding, although this is not required.

There is no way to represent a constant {{ByteString}}
value in IDL, although {{ByteString}} [=dictionary member=] [=dictionary member/default values=]
and [=optional argument|operation optional argument=] [=optional argument/default values=]
can be set to [=value of string literal tokens|the value=] of a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> literal.

The [=type name=] of the
{{ByteString}} type is "<code>ByteString</code>".

<p class="advisement">
    Specifications should only use
    {{ByteString}} for interfacing with protocols
    that use bytes and strings interchangeably, such as HTTP.  In general,
    strings should be represented with
    {{DOMString}} values, even if it is expected
    that values of the string will always be in ASCII or some
    8 bit character encoding. [=sequence types|Sequences=] or
    [=frozen array type|frozen arrays=] with {{octet}} or {{byte}}
    elements, {{Uint8Array}}, or {{Int8Array}} should be used for holding
    8 bit data rather than {{ByteString}}.
</p>


<h4 oldids="dom-USVString" id="idl-USVString" interface>USVString</h4>

The {{USVString}} type
corresponds to the set of all possible sequences of
[=Unicode scalar values=],
which are all of the Unicode code points apart from the
surrogate code points.

There is no way to represent a constant {{USVString}}
value in IDL, although {{USVString}} [=dictionary member=] [=dictionary member/default values=]
and [=optional argument|operation optional argument=] [=optional argument/default values=]
can be set to [=value of string literal tokens|the value=] of a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> literal.

The [=type name=] of the
{{USVString}} type is "<code>USVString</code>".

<p class="advisement">
    Specifications should only use
    {{USVString}} for APIs that perform
    text processing and need a string of Unicode
    scalar values to operate on.  Most APIs that use strings
    should instead be using {{DOMString}},
    which does not make any interpretations of the [=code units=]
    in the string.  When in doubt, use {{DOMString}}.
</p>


<h4 oldids="dom-object" id="idl-object" interface>object</h4>

The {{object}} type corresponds to the set of
all possible non-null object references.

There is no way to represent a constant {{object}}
value in IDL.

To denote a type that includes all possible object references plus the
<emu-val>null</emu-val> value, use the [=nullable type=]
<code class="idl">object?</code>.

The [=type name=] of the
{{object}} type is "<code>Object</code>".

<h4 id="idl-symbol" interface>symbol</h4>

The {{symbol}} type corresponds to the set of all possible symbol values. Symbol values are opaque,
non-{{object}} values which nevertheless have identity (i.e., are only equal to themselves).

There is no way to represent a constant {{symbol}} value in IDL.

The [=type name=] of the {{symbol}} type is "<code>Symbol</code>".


<h4 id="idl-interface" dfn>Interface types</h4>

An [=identifier=] that
identifies an [=interface=] is used to refer to
a type that corresponds to the set of all possible non-null references to objects that
implement that interface.

An IDL value of the interface type is represented just
by an object reference.

There is no way to represent a constant object reference value for
a particular interface type in IDL.

To denote a type that includes all possible references to objects implementing
the given interface plus the <emu-val>null</emu-val> value,
use a [=nullable type=].

The [=type name=] of an interface type
is the [=identifier=] of the interface.


<h4 id="idl-callback-interface" dfn>Callback interface types</h4>

An [=identifier=] that identifies a [=callback interface=] is used to refer to a type that
corresponds to the set of all possible non-null references to objects.

An IDL value of the interface type is represented by a tuple of an object reference and a
<dfn id="dfn-callback-context" export>callback context</dfn>.
The [=callback context=] is a language binding specific value, and is used to store information
about the execution context at the time the language binding specific object reference is
converted to an IDL value.

Note: For ECMAScript objects, the [=callback context=] is used to hold a reference to the
[=incumbent settings object=] at the time the Object value is converted to an IDL callback
interface type value. See [[#es-callback-interface]].

There is no way to represent a constant object reference value for a particular
[=callback interface type=] in IDL.

To denote a type that includes all possible references to objects plus the <emu-val>null</emu-val>
value, use a [=nullable type=].

The [=type name=] of a [=callback interface type=] is the [=identifier=] of the
[=callback interface=].


<h4 id="idl-dictionary" dfn>Dictionary types</h4>

An [=identifier=] that
identifies a [=dictionary=] is used to refer to
a type that corresponds to the set of all dictionaries that adhere to
the dictionary definition.

The literal syntax for [=ordered maps=] may also be used to represent dictionaries, when it is
implicitly understood from context that the map is being treated as an instance of a specific
dictionary type. However, there is no way to represent a constant dictionary value inside IDL
fragments.

The [=type name=] of a dictionary type
is the [=identifier=] of the dictionary.


<h4 id="idl-enumeration" dfn export>Enumeration types</h4>

An [=identifier=] that
identifies an [=enumeration=] is used to
refer to a type whose values are the set of strings (sequences of
[=code units=], as with
{{DOMString}}) that are the
[=enumeration values|enumeration’s values=].

Like {{DOMString}}, there is no way to represent a constant [=enumeration=]
value in IDL, although enumeration-typed [=dictionary member=] [=dictionary member/default values=]
and [=optional argument|operation optional argument=] [=optional argument/default values=]
can be set to [=value of string literal tokens|the value=] of a
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-string">string</a></emu-t> literal.

The [=type name=] of an enumeration type
is the [=identifier=] of the enumeration.


<h4 id="idl-callback-function" dfn>Callback function types</h4>

An [=identifier=] that identifies
a [=callback function=] is used to refer to
a type whose values are references to objects that are functions with the given signature.

Note: If the [{{LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull}}] [=extended attribute=] is specified on the [=definition=] of
the [=callback function=], the values can be references to objects that are not functions.

An IDL value of the callback function type is represented by a tuple of an object
reference and a [=callback context=].

Note: As with [=callback interface types=], the [=callback context=] is used to hold a
reference to the [=incumbent settings object=] at
the time an ECMAScript Object value is converted to an IDL
callback function type value.  See [[#es-callback-function]].

There is no way to represent a constant [=callback function=]
value in IDL.

The [=type name=] of a callback function type
is the [=identifier=] of the callback function.


<h4 id="idl-nullable-type">Nullable types — |T|?</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-nullable-type" export>nullable type</dfn> is an IDL type constructed
from an existing type (called the <dfn id="dfn-inner-type" export for="nullable types">inner type</dfn>),
which just allows the additional value <emu-val>null</emu-val>
to be a member of its set of values.  [=Nullable types=]
are represented in IDL by placing a <span class="char">U+003F QUESTION MARK ("?")</span>
character after an existing type.
The [=nullable types/inner type=] must not be:

*   {{any}},
*   a [=Promise type=],
*   another nullable type, or
*   a [=union type=] that itself [=includes a nullable type=]
    or has a dictionary type as one of its [=flattened member types=].

Note: Although dictionary types can in general be nullable,
they cannot when used as the type of an operation argument or a dictionary member.

Nullable type constant values in IDL are represented in the same way that
constant values of their [=nullable types/inner type=]
would be represented, or with the <emu-t>null</emu-t> token.

The [=type name=] of a nullable type
is the concatenation of the type name of the [=nullable types/inner type=] |T| and
the string "<code>OrNull</code>".

<div class="example">

    For example, a type that allows the values <emu-val>true</emu-val>,
    <emu-val>false</emu-val> and <emu-val>null</emu-val>
    is written as <code class="idl">boolean?</code>:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface NetworkFetcher {
          undefined get(optional boolean? areWeThereYet = false);
        };
    </pre>

    The following [=interface=] has two
    [=attributes=]: one whose value can
    be a {{DOMString}} or the <emu-val>null</emu-val>
    value, and another whose value can be a reference to a <code class="idl">Node</code>
    object or the <emu-val>null</emu-val> value:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Node {
          readonly attribute DOMString? namespaceURI;
          readonly attribute Node? parentNode;
          // ...
        };
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 oldids="dom-sequence" id="idl-sequence" lt="sequence" dfn export>Sequence types — sequence&lt;|T|&gt;</h4>

The <dfn lt="sequence type" export>sequence&lt;|T|&gt;</dfn>
type is a parameterized type whose values are (possibly zero-length) [=lists=] of
values of type |T|.

Sequences are always passed by value.  In
language bindings where a sequence is represented by an object of
some kind, passing a sequence to a [=platform object=]
will not result in a reference to the sequence being kept by that object.
Similarly, any sequence returned from a platform object
will be a copy and modifications made to it will not be visible to the platform object.

The literal syntax for [=lists=] may also be used to represent sequences, when it is implicitly
understood from context that the list is being treated as a sequences. However, there is no way to
represent a constant sequence value inside IDL fragments.

Sequences must not be used as the
type of an [=attribute=] or
[=constant=].

Note: This restriction exists so that it is clear to specification writers
and API users that [=sequence types|sequences=]
are copied rather than having references
to them passed around.  Instead of a writable [=attribute=] of a sequence
type, it is suggested that a pair of [=operations=] to get and set the
sequence is used.

The [=type name=] of a sequence type
is the concatenation of the type name for |T| and
the string "<code>Sequence</code>".

Any [=list=] can be implicitly treated as a <code>sequence&lt;|T|&gt;</code>, as long as it contains
only [=list/items=] that are of type |T|.


<h4 id="idl-record" lt="record" dfn export>Record types — record&lt;|K|, |V|&gt;</h4>

A <dfn export>record type</dfn> is a parameterized type whose values are [=ordered maps=] with
[=map/keys=] that are instances of |K| and [=map/values=] that are instances of |V|. |K| must be one
of {{DOMString}}, {{USVString}}, or {{ByteString}}.

The literal syntax for [=ordered maps=] may also be used to represent records, when it is implicitly
understood from context that the map is being treated as a record. However, there is no way to
represent a constant record value inside IDL fragments.

Records are always passed by value. In language bindings where a record
is represented by an object of some kind, passing a record
to a [=platform object=] will not result in a reference to the record
being kept by that object. Similarly, any record returned from a
platform object will be a copy and modifications made to it will not be visible
to the platform object.

Records must not be used as the type of an [=attribute=] or
[=constant=].

The [=type name=] of a record type is the concatenation of the type
name for |K|, the type name for |V| and the string "<code>Record</code>".

Any [=ordered map=] can be implicitly treated as a <code>record&lt;|K|, |V|&gt;</code>, as long as
it contains only [=map/entries=] whose [=map/keys=] are all of of type |K| and whose [=map/values=]
are all of type |V|.


<h4 oldids="dom-promise" id="idl-promise" interface lt="Promise|Promise&lt;T&gt;">Promise types — Promise&lt;|T|&gt;</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-promise-type" export>promise type</dfn> is a parameterized type
whose values are references to objects that “is used as a place holder
for the eventual results of a deferred (and possibly asynchronous) computation
result of an asynchronous operation”.
See <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-promise-objects">section 25.4</a>
of the ECMAScript specification for details on the semantics of promise objects.

Promise types are non-nullable, but |T| may be nullable.

There is no way to represent a promise value in IDL.

The [=type name=] of a promise type
is the concatenation of the type name for |T| and
the string "<code>Promise</code>".


<h4 id="idl-union">Union types</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-union-type" export>union type</dfn> is a type whose set of values
is the union of those in two or more other types.  Union types (matching
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-UnionType">UnionType</a></emu-nt>)
are written as a series of types separated by the <emu-t>or</emu-t> keyword
with a set of surrounding parentheses.
The types which comprise the union type are known as the
union’s <dfn id="dfn-union-member-type" for="union" export>member types</dfn>.

<div class="note">

    For example, you might write <code>(Node or DOMString)</code>
    or <code>(double or sequence&lt;double&gt;)</code>.  When applying a
    <emu-t>?</emu-t> suffix to a
    [=union type=]
    as a whole, it is placed after the closing parenthesis,
    as in <code>(Node or DOMString)?</code>.

    Note that the [=member types=]
    of a union type do not descend into nested union types.  So for
    <code>(double or (sequence&lt;long&gt; or Event) or (Node or DOMString)?)</code> the member types
    are <code>double</code>, <code>(sequence&lt;long&gt; or Event)</code> and
    <code>(Node or DOMString)?</code>.

</div>

Like the {{any}} type, values of
union types have a [=specific type=],
which is the particular [=member type=]
that matches the value.

<div algorithm>

    The <dfn id="dfn-flattened-union-member-types" for="union" export>flattened member types</dfn>
    of a [=union type=], possibly [=annotated type|annotated=], is a set of types determined as
    follows:

    1.  Let |T| be the [=union type=].
    1.  Initialize |S| to ∅.
    1.  For each [=member type=] |U| of |T|:
        1.  If |U| is an [=annotated type=], then
            set |U| to be the [=annotated types/inner type=] of |U|.
        1.  If |U| is a [=nullable type=], then
            set |U| to be the [=nullable types/inner type=] of |U|.
        1.  If |U| is a [=union type=], then
            add to |S| the [=flattened member types=]
            of |U|.
        1.  Otherwise, |U| is not a [=union type=].
            Add |U| to |S|.
    1.  Return |S|.
</div>


Note: For example, the [=flattened member types=]
of the [=union type=]
<code>(Node or (sequence&lt;long&gt; or Event) or (XMLHttpRequest or DOMString)? or sequence&lt;(sequence&lt;double&gt; or NodeList)&gt;)</code>
are the six types <code>Node</code>, <code>sequence&lt;long&gt;</code>, <code>Event</code>,

<div algorithm>

    The <dfn id="dfn-number-of-nullable-member-types" export>number of nullable member types</dfn>
    of a [=union type=] is an integer
    determined as follows:

    1.  Let |T| be the [=union type=].
    1.  Initialize |n| to 0.
    1.  For each [=member type=] |U| of |T|:
        1.  If |U| is a [=nullable type=], then:
            1.  Set |n| to |n| + 1.
            1.  Set |U| to be the [=nullable types/inner type=] of |U|.
        1.  If |U| is a [=union type=], then:
            1.  Let |m| be the [=number of nullable member types=] of |U|.
            1.  Set |n| to |n| + |m|.
    1.  Return |n|.
</div>

The {{any}} type must not
be used as a [=member types|union member type=].

The [=number of nullable member types=]
of a [=union type=] must
be 0 or 1, and if it is 1 then the union type must also not have
a [=dictionary type=] in its [=flattened member types=].

A type <dfn id="dfn-includes-a-nullable-type" export>includes a nullable type</dfn> if:

*   the type is a [=nullable type=], or
*   the type is an [=annotated type=] and its [=annotated types/inner type=] is a nullable type, or
*   the type is a [=union type=] and its
    [=number of nullable member types=] is 1.

Each pair of [=flattened member types=]
in a [=union type=], <var ignore>T</var> and <var ignore>U</var>,
must be [=distinguishable=].

<p class="advisement" id="limit-bigint-numeric-unions">
It is possible to create a union of {{bigint}} and a [=numeric type=].
However, this is generally only supposed to be used for interfaces such as
[[ECMA-402#numberformat-objects|NumberFormat]], which formats the values rather than using them in
calculations.
It would not be appropriate to accept such a union, only to then convert values of the
[=numeric type=] to a {{bigint}} for further processing, as this runs the risk of introducing
precision errors.

[=Union type=] constant values
in IDL are represented in the same way that constant values of their
[=member types=] would be
represented.

The [=type name=] of a union
type is formed by taking the type names of each member type, in order,
and joining them with the string "<code>Or</code>".

Additional types can be created from existing ones by specifying certain [=extended attributes=] on

<h4 id="idl-buffer-source-types">Buffer source types</h4>

There are a number of types that correspond to sets of all possible non-null
references to objects that represent a buffer of data or a view on to a buffer of
data.  The table below lists these types and the kind of buffer or view they represent.

<table class="vert data">
    <tr><th>Type</th><th>Kind of buffer</th></tr>
    <tr><td><dfn id="idl-ArrayBuffer" interface>ArrayBuffer</dfn></td><td>An object that holds a pointer (which may be null) to a buffer of a fixed number of bytes</td></tr>

    <td>A view on to an {{ArrayBuffer}} that exposes it as an array of IEEE 754 floating point numbers of the given size in bits</td></tr>
</table>

Note: These types all correspond to classes defined in ECMAScript.

There is no way to represent a constant value of any of these types in IDL.

The [=type name=] of all
of these types is the name of the type itself.

At the specification prose level, IDL [=buffer source types=]
are simply references to objects.  To inspect or manipulate the bytes inside the buffer,
specification prose must first either
<dfn id="dfn-get-buffer-source-reference" export lt="get a reference to the buffer source">get a reference to the bytes held by the buffer source</dfn>
or <dfn id="dfn-get-buffer-source-copy" export lt="get a copy of the buffer source">get a copy of the bytes held by the buffer source</dfn>.
With a reference to the buffer source’s bytes, specification prose can get or set individual
byte values using that reference.

<div class="advisement">

    Extreme care must be taken when writing specification text that gets a reference
    to the bytes held by a buffer source, as the underlying data can easily be changed
    by the script author or other APIs at unpredictable times.  If you are using a buffer source type
    as an operation argument to obtain a chunk of binary data that will not be modified,
    it is strongly recommended to get a copy of the buffer source’s bytes at the beginning
    of the prose defining the operation.

    Requiring prose to explicitly get a reference to or copy of the bytes is intended to
    help specification reviewers look for problematic uses of these buffer source types.

</div>

<div class="note">

    When designing APIs that take a buffer, it is recommended to use the
    {{BufferSource}} typedef rather than {{ArrayBuffer}}
    or any of the view types.

    When designing APIs that create and return a buffer, it is recommended
    to use the {{ArrayBuffer}} type rather than
    {{Uint8Array}}.

</div>

Attempting to [=get a reference to the buffer source|get a reference to=] or
[=get a copy of the buffer source|get a copy of the bytes held by a buffer source=]
when the {{ArrayBuffer}} has been [=ArrayBuffer/detached=]
will fail in a language binding-specific manner.

Note: See [[#es-buffer-source-types]] below for
how interacting with buffer source types works in the ECMAScript language binding.

<p class="issue">
    We should include an example of specification text that uses these types and terms.

<h4 oldids="dom-FrozenArray" id="idl-frozen-array" interface lt="FrozenArray|FrozenArray&lt;T&gt;">Frozen array types — FrozenArray&lt;|T|&gt;</h4>

A <dfn id="dfn-frozen-array-type" export>frozen array type</dfn> is a parameterized
type whose values are references to objects that hold a fixed length array
of unmodifiable values.  The values in the array are of type |T|.

Since <a interface lt="FrozenArray">FrozenArray&lt;|T|&gt;</a> values
are references, they are unlike [=sequence types=],
which are lists of values that are passed by value.

There is no way to represent a constant frozen array value in IDL.

The [=type name=] of a frozen array
type is the concatenation of the type name for |T| and the string
"<code>Array</code>".

<h4 id="idl-observable-array" interface lt="ObservableArray|ObservableArray&lt;T&gt;">Observable array types — ObservableArray&lt;|T|&gt;</h4>

An <dfn id="dfn-observable-array-type" export>observable array type</dfn> is a parameterized type
whose values are references to a combination of a mutable list of objects of type |T|, as well as
behavior to perform when author code modifies the contents of the list.

The parameterized type must not be a [=dictionary type=], [=sequence type=], or [=record type=].

Similar to [=sequence types=] and [=frozen array types=], observable array types wrap around
ECMAScript array types, imposing additional semantics on their usage.

Observable array types must only be used as the type of [=regular attributes=].

For an attribute whose type is an observable array type, specification authors can specify a series
of algorithms:

*   <dfn for="observable array attribute">set an indexed value</dfn>, which accepts an IDL value
    that is about to be set in the observable array, and the index at which it is being set;
*   <dfn for="observable array attribute">delete an indexed value</dfn>, which accepts an IDL value
    that is about to be removed from the observable array, and the index from which it is being
    removed.

Both of these algorithms are optional, and if not provided, the default behavior will be to do
nothing. Either algorithm may throw an exception, e.g. to reject invalid values.

Note that when ECMAScript code sets an existing index to a new value, this will first call the
[=observable array attribute/delete an indexed value=] algorithm to remove the existing value, and
then the [=observable array attribute/set an indexed value=] algorithm with the new value.

Every [=regular attribute=] whose type is an [=observable array type=] has a
<dfn for="observable array attribute">backing list</dfn>, which is a [=list=], initially empty.
Specification authors can modify the contents of the backing list, which will automatically be
reflected in the contents of the observable array as observed by ECMAScript code. Similarly, any
modifications by ECMAScript code to the contents of the observable array will be reflected back into
the backing list, after passing through the [=observable array attribute/set an indexed value=] and
[=observable array attribute/delete an indexed value=] algorithms.

There is no way to represent a constant observable array value in IDL.

The [=type name=] of an observable array type is the concatenation of the type name for |T| and the
string "<code>ObservableArray</code>".

<div class="example">
    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an [=interface=] with an observable array attribute:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Building {
          attribute ObservableArray&lt;Employee> employees;
        };
    </pre>

    The behavior of the attribute could be defined like so:

    <blockquote>
        The [=observable array attribute/set an indexed value=] algorithm for
        <code class="idl">Building</code>'s <code class="idl">employees</code> attribute, given
        |employee| and |index|, is:

        1.  If |employee| is not allowed to enter the building today, then throw a
            "{{NotAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}}.
        1.  If |index| is greater than 200, then throw a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}}.
        1.  Put |employee| to work!

        The [=observable array attribute/delete an indexed value=] algorithm for
        <code class="idl">Building</code>'s <code class="idl">employees</code> attribute, given
        |employee| and <var ignore>index</var>, is:

        1.  Alert security that |employee| has left the building.
    </blockquote>

    Then, ECMAScript code could manipulate the <code class="idl">employees</code> property in
    various ways:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Get an instance of Building.
        const building = getBuilding();

        building.employees.push(new Employee("A"));
        building.employees.push(new Employee("B"));
        building.employees.push(new Employee("C"));

        building.employees.splice(1, 1);
        const employeeB = building.employees.pop();

        building.employees = [new Employee("D"), employeeB, new Employee("C")];

        building.employees.length = 0;

        // Will throw:
        building.employees.push("not an Employee; a string instead");
    </pre>

    All of these manipulations would pass through the above-defined
    [=observable array attribute/set an indexed value=] algorithm, potentially throwing if the
    conditions described there were met. They would also perform the appropriate side effects listed
    there and in the [=observable array attribute/delete an indexed value=] algorithm.

    Another thing to note about the above code example is how all of the ECMAScript array methods
    from {{%Array.prototype%}} work on the observable array. Indeed, it fully behaves like an
    <code>Array</code> instance:

    <pre highlight="js">
        const normalArray = [];

        // If building.employees were defined as an indexed property getter interface: normalArray
        // would contains a single item, building.employees.
        //
        // For observable arrays (and frozen arrays): normalArray contains all of the items inside
        // of building.employees.
        normalArray.concat(building.employees);

        // names is an ECMAScript Array.
        const names = building.employees.map(employee => employee.name);

        // Passes various brand checks:
        console.assert(building.employees instanceof Array);
        console.assert(Array.isArray(building.employees));
        console.assert(building.employees.constructor === Array);

        // Even is treated as an array by JSON.stringify!
        console.assert(JSON.stringify(building.employees) === `["object Employee"]`);
    </pre>
</div>

<h2 id="ecmascript-binding">ECMAScript binding</h2>

This section describes how definitions written with the IDL defined in
[[#idl]] correspond to particular constructs
in ECMAScript, as defined by the <cite>ECMAScript Language Specification</cite>
[[!ECMA-262]].

Unless otherwise specified, objects defined in this section are ordinary objects as described in
[=ECMA-262 Ordinary object internal methods and internal slots=], and if the
object is a [=function object=], [=ECMA-262 Built-in function objects=].

This section may redefine certain internal methods and/or internal slots of objects. Other
specifications may also override the definitions of any internal method and/or internal slots of a
[=platform object=] that is an instance of an [=interface=]. These objects with changed semantics
shall be treated in accordance with the rules for exotic objects.

<p class="advisement">
    As overriding internal ECMAScript object methods is a low level operation and
    can result in objects that behave differently from ordinary objects,
    this facility should not be used unless necessary
    for security or compatibility. <span class="non-normative">This is currently used to define the
    {{HTMLAllCollection}} and {{Location}} interfaces. [[HTML]]</span>
</p>

Unless otherwise specified, exotic objects defined in this section and other specifications have the
same [=ordinary object/internal slots=] as ordinary objects, and all of the internal methods for
which alternative definitions are not given are the same as [=ordinary object/internal
methods|those=] of ordinary objects.

Unless otherwise specified, the \[[Extensible]] internal slot
of objects defined in this section has the value <emu-val>true</emu-val>.

Unless otherwise specified, the \[[Prototype]] internal slot
of objects defined in this section is {{%Object.prototype%}}.

Some objects described in this section are defined to have a <dfn id="dfn-class-string" export>class string</dfn>,
which is the string to include in the string returned from <code>Object.prototype.toString</code>.

If an object has a [=class string=] |classString|, then the object must,
at the time it is created, have a property whose name is the {{@@toStringTag}} symbol
with PropertyDescriptor{\[[Writable]]: <emu-val>false</emu-val>,
\[[Enumerable]]: <emu-val>false</emu-val>, \[[Configurable]]: <emu-val>true</emu-val>,
\[[Value]]: |classString|}.

<p id="ecmascript-abstractop">
    Algorithms in this section use the conventions described in [=ECMA-262
    Algorithm conventions=], such as the use of steps and substeps, the use of mathematical
    operations, and so on.  This section may also reference abstract operations
    and notations defined in other parts of ECMA-262.
</p>

When an algorithm says to
<dfn noexport lt="ECMAScript throw" local-lt="throw" for="ECMAScript" id="ecmascript-throw">throw</dfn> a <code>|Something|Error</code>
then this means to construct a new ECMAScript <code>|Something|Error</code> object in
the [=current Realm=] and to throw it, just as the algorithms in ECMA-262 do.

Note that algorithm steps can call in to other algorithms and abstract operations and
not explicitly handle exceptions that are thrown from them.  When an exception
is thrown by an algorithm or abstract operation and it is not explicitly
handled by the caller, then it is taken to end the algorithm and propagate out
to its caller, and so on.

<div class="example">

    <div algorithm="example algorithm">

        Consider the following algorithm:

        1.  Let |x| be the ECMAScript value passed in to this algorithm.
        1.  Let |y| be the result of calling <a abstract-op>ToString</a>(|x|).
        1.  Return |y|.
    </div>

    Since <a abstract-op>ToString</a> can throw an exception (for example if passed the object
    <code>({ toString: function() { throw 1 } })</code>), and the exception is
    not handled in the above algorithm, if one is thrown then it causes this
    algorithm to end and for the exception to propagate out to its caller, if there
    is one.

</div>


<h3 id="es-environment">ECMAScript environment</h3>

In an ECMAScript implementation of a given set of
[=IDL fragments=],
there will exist a number of ECMAScript objects that correspond to
definitions in those [=IDL fragments=].
These objects are termed the <dfn id="dfn-initial-object" export>initial objects</dfn>,
and comprise the following:

*   [=interface objects=]
*   [=legacy callback interface objects=]
*   [=legacy factory functions=]
*   [=interface prototype objects=]
*   [=named properties objects=]
*   [=iterator prototype objects=]
*   [=attribute getters=]
*   [=attribute setters=]
*   <a href="#es-operations">the function objects that correspond to operations</a>
*   <a href="#es-stringifier">the function objects that correspond to stringifiers</a>
*   <a href="#es-iterators">the function objects that correspond to iterators</a>
*   [=map size getters=]

Each [=Realm=]
must have its own unique set of each of
the [=initial objects=], created
before control enters any ECMAScript execution context associated with the
Realm, but after the [=Realm/global object=] for that Realm is created.  The \[[Prototype]]s
of all initial objects in a given [=Realm=] must come from
that same [=Realm=].

<div class="example">

    In an HTML user agent, multiple [=Realms=] can exist when
    multiple frames or windows are created.  Each frame or window will have
    its own set of [=initial objects=],
    which the following HTML document demonstrates:

    <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Different Realms&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;iframe id=a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
        var iframe = document.getElementById("a");
        var w = iframe.contentWindow;              // The global object in the frame

        Object == w.Object;                        // Evaluates to false, per ECMA-262
        Node == w.Node;                            // Evaluates to false
        iframe instanceof w.Node;                  // Evaluates to false
        iframe instanceof w.Object;                // Evaluates to false
        iframe.appendChild instanceof Function;    // Evaluates to true
        iframe.appendChild instanceof w.Function;  // Evaluates to false
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
</div>

Note: All [=interfaces=] define which [=Realms=] they are [=exposed=] in.
This allows, for example, [=Realms=] for Web Workers to [=expose=]
different sets of supported interfaces from those exposed in Realms
for Web pages.

Although at the time of this writing the ECMAScript specification does not reflect this,
every ECMAScript object must have an <dfn id="dfn-associated-realm" export>associated [=Realm=]</dfn>. The mechanisms
for associating objects with Realms are, for now, underspecified. However, we note that
in the case of [=platform objects=], the
associated Realm is equal to the object's [=relevant Realm=], and
for non-exotic [=function objects=] (i.e. not [=ECMAScript/callable=] proxies, and not bound functions)
the associated Realm is equal to the value of the [=function object=]'s \[[Realm]] internal
slot.


<h3 id="es-type-mapping">ECMAScript type mapping</h3>

This section describes how types in the IDL map to types in ECMAScript.

Each sub-section below describes how values of a given IDL type are represented
in ECMAScript.  For each IDL type, it is described how ECMAScript values are
<dfn id="dfn-convert-ecmascript-to-idl-value" export lt="converted to an IDL value|converted to IDL values">converted to an IDL value</dfn>
when passed to a [=platform object=] expecting that type, and how IDL values
of that type are <dfn id="dfn-convert-idl-to-ecmascript-value" export lt="converted to an ECMAScript value|converted to ECMAScript values">converted to ECMAScript values</dfn>
when returned from a platform object.

Note that the sub-sections and algorithms below also apply to [=annotated types=] created by applying
extended attributes to the types named in their headers.

Mathematical operations used in this section,

are to be understood as computing exact mathematical results

    Array with elements of type Number
    represents a <code class="idl">sequence&lt;double&gt;</code>.  The
    Array objects are effectively passed by
    value; every time the <code>getSupportedImageCodecs()</code>
    function is called a new Array is
    returned, and whenever an Array is
    passed to <code>drawPolygon</code> no reference
    will be kept after the call completes.

        <pre highlight="js">

    </pre>

    With this definition, a call to <code>readPixels</code> with an {{ECMAScript/SharedArrayBuffer}}
    instance, or any typed array or {{ECMAScript/DataView}} backed by one, will throw a

<h4 id="Clamp" extended-attribute lt="Clamp">[Clamp]</h4>

If the [{{Clamp}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on one of the [=integer types=], it creates a new
IDL type such that that when an ECMAScript Number is converted to the IDL type,
out-of-range values will be clamped to the range of valid values, rather than using the operators
that use a modulo operation (<a abstract-op>ToInt32</a>, <a abstract-op>ToUint32</a>, etc.).

The [{{Clamp}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

A type annotated with the [{{Clamp}}] extended attribute must not appear in a [=read only=]
attribute. A type must not be [=extended attributes associated with|associated with=] both the
[{{Clamp}}] and [{{EnforceRange}}] extended attributes. A type that is not an [=integer type=] must
not be [=extended attributes associated with|associated with=] the [{{Clamp}}] extended attribute.

See the rules for converting ECMAScript values to the various IDL integer
types in [[#es-integer-types]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{Clamp}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    In the following [=IDL fragment=],
    two [=operations=] are declared that
    take three {{octet}} arguments; one uses
    the [{{Clamp}}] [=extended attribute=]
    on all three arguments, while the other does not:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface GraphicsContext {
          undefined setColor(octet red, octet green, octet blue);
          undefined setColorClamped([Clamp] octet red, [Clamp] octet green, [Clamp] octet blue);
        };
    </pre>

    A call to <code>setColorClamped</code> with
    Number values that are out of range for an
    {{octet}} are clamped to the range [0, 255].

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Get an instance of GraphicsContext.
        var context = getGraphicsContext();

        // Calling the non-[Clamp] version uses ToUint8 to coerce the Numbers to octets.
        // This is equivalent to calling setColor(255, 255, 1).
        context.setColor(-1, 255, 257);

        // Call setColorClamped with some out of range values.
        // This is equivalent to calling setColorClamped(0, 255, 255).
        context.setColorClamped(-1, 255, 257);
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="CrossOriginIsolated" extended-attribute lt="CrossOriginIsolated">[CrossOriginIsolated]</h4>

If the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on an
[=interface=],
[=partial interface=],
[=interface mixin=],
[=partial interface mixin=],
[=callback interface=],
[=namespace=],
[=partial namespace=],
[=interface member=],
[=interface mixin member=], or
[=namespace member=],
it indicates that the construct is [=exposed=] only within an environment whose
[=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability=] is true. The
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] extended attribute must not be used on any other construct.

The [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] extended attribute must [=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

If [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] appears on an [=overloaded=] [=operation=],
then it must appear on all overloads.

The [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] [=extended attribute=] must not be specified both on

* an [=interface member=] and its [=interface=] or [=partial interface=];
* an [=interface mixin member=] and its [=interface mixin=] or [=partial interface mixin=];
* a [=namespace member=] and its [=namespace=] or [=partial namespace=].

Note: This is because adding the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] [=extended attribute=] on a [=member=]
when its containing definition is also annotated with the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}]
[=extended attribute=] does not further restrict the exposure of the [=member=].

An [=interface=] without the [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}] [=extended attribute=]
must not [=interface/inherit=] from another interface
that does specify [{{CrossOriginIsolated}}].

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface with one [=operation=] that is executable
    from all contexts, and two which are executable only from cross-origin isolated contexts.

    <pre highlight="webidl">

          [CrossOriginIsolated] readonly attribute boolean secretBoolean;
        };

        // HighResolutionTimer will not be exposed in a non-isolated context, nor will its members.
        // In such a context, there will be no "HighResolutionTimer" property on Window.

          DOMHighResTimeStamp getHighResolutionTime();
        };

        // The interface mixin members defined below will never be exposed in a non-isolated

<h4 id="Default" extended-attribute lt="Default">[Default]</h4>

If the [{{Default}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on a [=regular operation=], then it indicates
that the appropriate [=default method steps=] must be carried out when the operation is invoked.

The [{{Default}}] extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{Default}}] extended attribute must not be used on anything other than a [=regular operation=]
that [=has default method steps=] defined.

<div class="example" id="example-tojson-default">

    As an example, the [{{Default}}] extended attribute is suitable
    for use on <code>toJSON</code> [=regular operations=]:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Animal {
          attribute DOMString name;
          attribute unsigned short age;

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Human : Animal {

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dog : Animal {
          attribute DOMString? breed;
        };

    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript language binding, there would exist a <code>toJSON()</code> method on
    <code class="idl">Animal</code>, <code class="idl">Human</code>,
    and (via inheritance) <code class="idl">Dog</code> objects:

    <pre highlight="js">

        alice.toJSON();

        // Evaluates to an object like this (notice how "breed" is absent,

        JSON.stringify(alice);
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="EnforceRange" extended-attribute lt="EnforceRange">[EnforceRange]</h4>

If the [{{EnforceRange}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on one of the [=integer types=], it creates
a new IDL type such that that when an ECMAScript Number is converted to the IDL
type, out-of-range values will cause an exception to be thrown, rather than being converted to a
valid value using using the operators that use a modulo operation (<a abstract-op>ToInt32</a>, <a abstract-op>ToUint32</a>, etc.).
The Number will be rounded toward zero before being checked against its range.

The [{{EnforceRange}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

A type annotated with the [{{EnforceRange}}] extended attribute must not appear in a
[=read only=] attribute. A type must not be [=extended attributes associated with|associated with=]
both the [{{Clamp}}] and [{{EnforceRange}}] extended attributes. A type that is not an
[=integer type=] must not be [=extended attributes associated with|associated with=] the
[{{EnforceRange}}] extended attribute.

See the rules for converting ECMAScript values to the various IDL integer
types in [[#es-type-mapping]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{EnforceRange}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    In the following [=IDL fragment=],
    two [=operations=] are declared that
    take three {{octet}} arguments; one uses
    the [{{EnforceRange}}] [=extended attribute=]
    on all three arguments, while the other does not:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]

          undefined setColorEnforcedRange([EnforceRange] octet red, [EnforceRange] octet green, [EnforceRange] octet blue);
        };
    </pre>

    In an ECMAScript implementation of the IDL, a call to setColorEnforcedRange with
    Number values that are out of range for an
    {{octet}} will result in an exception being
    thrown.

    <pre highlight="js">

<h4 id="Exposed" extended-attribute lt="Exposed">[Exposed]</h4>

When the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on
an [=interface=],
[=partial interface=],
[=interface mixin=],
[=partial interface mixin=],
[=callback interface=],
[=namespace=],
[=partial namespace=], or
an individual [=interface member=],
[=interface mixin member=], or
[=namespace member=],
it indicates that the construct is exposed
on that particular set of global interfaces.

The [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] must either
[=takes an identifier|take an identifier=] or
[=takes an identifier list|take an identifier list=].
Each of the identifiers mentioned must be a [=global name=] and be unique.
This list of identifiers is known as the construct's
<dfn>own exposure set</dfn>.

<div algorithm>

    To get the <dfn id="dfn-exposure-set" export>exposure set</dfn> of a construct |C|,
    run the following steps:

    1.  Assert: |C| is an [=interface=], [=callback interface=], [=namespace=],
        [=interface member=], [=interface mixin member=], or [=namespace member=].
    1.  Let |H| be |C|'s [=host interface=] if |C| is an [=interface mixin member=], or null otherwise.
    1.  If |C| is an [=interface member=], [=interface mixin member=], or [=namespace member=], then:
        1.  If the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] is specified on |C|, then:
            1.  If |H| is set, return the [=set/intersection=] of |C|'s [=own exposure set=]
                and |H|'s [=exposure set=].
            1.  Otherwise, return |C|'s [=own exposure set=].
        1.  Otherwise, set |C| to be the
            [=interface=], [=partial interface=],
            [=interface mixin=], [=partial interface mixin=],
            [=namespace=], or [=partial namespace=]
            |C| is declared on.
    1.  If |C| is a [=partial interface=], [=partial interface mixin=], or [=partial namespace=], then:
        1.  If the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] is specified on |C|, then:
            1.  If |H| is set, return the [=set/intersection=] of |C|'s [=own exposure set=]
                and |H|'s [=exposure set=].
            1.  Otherwise, return |C|'s [=own exposure set=].
        1.  Otherwise, set |C| to be the original [=interface=], [=interface mixin=], or [=namespace=]
            definition of |C|.
    1.  If |C| is an [=interface mixin=], then:
        1.  If the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] is specified on |C|,
            then return the [=set/intersection=] of |C|'s [=own exposure set=]
            and |H|'s [=exposure set=].
        1.  Otherwise, set |C| to |H|.
    1.  Assert: |C| is an [=interface=], [=callback interface=] or [=namespace=].
    1.  Assert: The [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] is specified on |C|.
    1.  Return |C|'s [=own exposure set=].
</div>

If [{{Exposed}}] appears on an [=overloaded=] [=operation=],
then it must appear identically on all overloads.

The [{{Exposed}}] extended attribute must not be specified both on
an [=interface member=], [=interface mixin member=], or [=namespace member=], and on
the [=partial interface=], [=partial interface mixin=], or [=partial namespace=] definition
the [=member=] is declared on.

Note: This is because adding an [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=] on a
[=partial interface=], [=partial interface mixin=], or [=partial namespace=]
is shorthand for annotating each of its [=members=].

If [{{Exposed}}] appears on a [=partial interface=] or [=partial namespace=],
then the partial's [=own exposure set=] must be a subset of
the [=exposure set=] of the partial's original [=interface=] or [=namespace=].

If [{{Exposed}}] appears on an [=interface member|interface=] or [=namespace member=],
then the [=member=]'s [=exposure set=] must be a subset
of the [=exposure set=] of the [=interface=] or [=namespace=] it is a member of.

If [{{Exposed}}] appears both on a [=partial interface mixin=]
and its original [=interface mixin=],
then the [=partial interface mixin=]'s [=own exposure set=]
must be a subset of the [=interface mixin=]'s [=own exposure set=].

If [{{Exposed}}] appears both on an [=interface mixin member=]
and the [=interface mixin=] it is a member of,
then the [=interface mixin members=]'s [=own exposure set=]
must be a subset of the [=interface mixin=]'s [=own exposure set=].

If an interface |X| [=interface/inherits=] from another interface |Y|
then the [=exposure set=] of |X| must be a subset of the [=exposure set=] of |Y|.

Note: As an [=interface mixin=] can be [=included=] by different [=interfaces=],
the [=exposure set=] of its [=interface mixin member|members=] is a function of
the [=interface=] that [=includes=] them.
If the [=interface mixin member=], [=partial interface mixin=], or [=interface mixin=]
is annotated with an [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=],
then the [=interface mixin member=]'s [=exposure set=]
is the [=set/intersection=] of the relevant construct's [=own exposure set=]
with the the [=host interface=]'s [=exposure set=].
Otherwise, it is the [=host interface=]'s [=exposure set=].

<div algorithm>
    An [=interface=], [=callback interface=], [=namespace=], or [=member=] |construct| is

Note: Since it is not possible for the [=relevant settings object=]
for an ECMAScript global object to change whether it is a
[=secure context=] or [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability=] over time, an

once, at the time the [=initial objects=] are created.

Note: The [=global names=] for the [=interface=] are the [=identifiers=] that can be used to
reference it in the [{{Exposed}}] [=extended attribute=].
A single name can be shared across multiple different global interfaces,
allowing an interface to more easily use [{{Exposed}}] to expose itself to all of them at once.
For example, "<code>Worker</code>" is used to refer to several distinct types of threading-related
global interfaces.

For these global [=interfaces=], the structure of the prototype chain and how properties
corresponding to [=interface members=] will be reflected on the prototype objects will be different
from other interfaces. Specifically:

1.  Any [=named properties=]
    will be exposed on an object in the prototype chain – the
    [=named properties object=] –
    rather than on the object itself.
1.  [=Interface members=] from the
    [=interface=]
    will correspond to properties on the object itself rather than on
    [=interface prototype objects=].

<div class="note">

    Placing named properties on an object in the prototype chain
    is done so that variable declarations and bareword assignments
    will shadow the named property with a property on the global
    object itself.

    Placing properties corresponding to interface members on
    the object itself will mean that common feature detection
    methods like the following will work:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var indexedDB = window.indexedDB || window.webkitIndexedDB ||
                        window.mozIndexedDB || window.msIndexedDB;

        var requestAnimationFrame = window.requestAnimationFrame ||
                                    window.mozRequestAnimationFrame || ...;
    </pre>

    Because of the way variable declarations are handled in
    ECMAScript, the code above would result in the <code>window.indexedDB</code>
    and <code>window.requestAnimationFrame</code> evaluating
    to <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>, as the shadowing variable
    property would already have been created before the
    assignment is evaluated.

</div>

If the [{{Global}}] [=extended attributes=] is
used on an [=interface=], then:

*   The interface must not define a [=named property setter=].
*   The interface must not define [=indexed property getters=] or [=indexed property setter|setters=].
*   The interface must not define a [=constructor operation=].
*   The interface must not also be declared with the [{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}]
    extended attribute.
*   The interface must not [=interface/inherit=] from another interface with the
    [{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}] extended attribute.
*   Any other interface must not [=interface/inherit=] from it.

If [{{Global}}] is specified on
a [=partial interface=]
definition, then that partial interface definition must
be the part of the interface definition that defines
the [=named property getter=].

The [{{Global}}] [=extended attribute=] must not
be used on an [=interface=] that can have more
than one object implementing it in the same [=Realm=].

Note: This is because the [=named properties object=],
which exposes the named properties, is in the prototype chain, and it would not make
sense for more than one object’s named properties to be exposed on an object that
all of those objects inherit from.

If an interface is declared with the [{{Global}}] [=extended attribute=], then
there must not be more than one
[=member=] across
the interface
with the same [=identifier=].
There also must not be more than
one [=stringifier=]
or more than one [=iterable declaration=],
[=asynchronously iterable declaration=],
[=maplike declaration=] or
[=setlike declaration=]
across those interfaces.

Note: This is because all of the [=members=] of the interface
get flattened down on to the object that [=implements=] the interface.

See [[#named-properties-object]] for the specific requirements
that the use of [{{Global}}] entails for [=named properties=],
and [[#es-constants]], [[#es-attributes]] and [[#es-operations]]
for the requirements relating to the location of properties
corresponding to [=interface members=].

<div class="example">

    The <code class="idl">Window</code> interface exposes frames as properties on the <code class="idl">Window</code>
    object.  Since the <code class="idl">Window</code> object also serves as the
    ECMAScript global object, variable declarations or assignments to the named properties
    will result in them being replaced by the new value.  Variable declarations for
    attributes will not create a property that replaces the existing one.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window, Global]
        interface Window {
          getter any (DOMString name);
          attribute DOMString name;
          // ...
        };
    </pre>

    The following HTML document illustrates how the named properties on the
    <code class="idl">Window</code> object can be shadowed, and how
    the property for an attribute will not be replaced when declaring
    a variable of the same name:

    <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Variable declarations and assignments on Window&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;iframe name=abc&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;!-- Shadowing named properties --&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
          window.abc;    // Evaluates to the iframe's Window object.
          abc = 1;       // Shadows the named property.
          window.abc;    // Evaluates to 1.
        &lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;!-- Preserving properties for IDL attributes --&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
          Window.prototype.def = 2;         // Places a property on the prototype.
          window.hasOwnProperty("length");  // Evaluates to true.
          length;                           // Evaluates to 1.
          def;                              // Evaluates to 2.
        &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
          var length;                       // Variable declaration leaves existing property.
          length;                           // Evaluates to 1.
          var def;                          // Variable declaration creates shadowing property.
          def;                              // Evaluates to undefined.
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="NewObject" extended-attribute lt="NewObject">[NewObject]</h4>

If the [{{NewObject}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on a [=regular operation|regular=]
or [=static operations|static=]
[=operation=],
then it indicates that when calling the operation,
a reference to a newly created object
must always be returned.

The [{{NewObject}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{NewObject}}]
extended attribute must not
be used on anything other than a [=regular operation|regular=]
or [=static operations|static=]
[=operation=]
whose [=return type=]
is an [=interface type=] or
a [=promise type=].

<div class="example">

    As an example, this extended attribute is suitable for use on
    the {{Document/createElement()}} operation on the {{Document}} interface,
    since a new object should always be returned when
    it is called. [[DOM]]

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Document : Node {
          [NewObject] Element createElement(DOMString localName);
          // ...
        };
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="PutForwards" extended-attribute lt="PutForwards">[PutForwards]</h4>

If the [{{PutForwards}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on a [=read only=]
[=regular attribute=] declaration whose type is
an [=interface type=],
it indicates that assigning to the attribute will have specific behavior.
Namely, the assignment is “forwarded” to the attribute (specified by
the extended attribute argument) on the object that is currently
referenced by the attribute being assigned to.

The [{{PutForwards}}] extended
attribute must [=takes an identifier|take an identifier=].
Assuming that:

*   |A| is the [=attribute=]
    on which the [{{PutForwards}}]
    extended attribute appears,
*   |I| is the [=interface=]
    on which |A| is declared,
*   |J| is the [=interface type=]
    that |A| is declared to be of, and
*   |N| is the [=identifier=]
    argument of the extended attribute,

then there must be another
[=attribute=] |B|
declared on |J| whose [=identifier=]
is |N|.  Assignment of a value to the attribute |A|
on an object implementing |I| will result in that value
being assigned to attribute |B| of the object that |A|
references, instead.

Note that [{{PutForwards}}]-annotated
[=attributes=] can be
chained.  That is, an attribute with the [{{PutForwards}}]
[=extended attribute=]
can refer to an attribute that itself has that extended attribute.
There must not exist a cycle in a
chain of forwarded assignments.  A cycle exists if, when following
the chain of forwarded assignments, a particular attribute on
an [=interface=] is
encountered more than once.

An attribute with the [{{PutForwards}}]
extended attribute must not also be declared
with the [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}] or
[{{Replaceable}}] extended attributes.

The [{{PutForwards}}]
extended attribute must not be used
on an [=attribute=] that
is not [=read only=].

The [{{PutForwards}}] extended attribute
must not be used on a
[=static attribute=].

The [{{PutForwards}}] extended attribute
must not be used on an attribute declared on
a [=namespace=].

See the <a href="#es-attributes">Attributes</a> section for how
[{{PutForwards}}]
is to be implemented.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines interfaces for names and people.
    The [{{PutForwards}}] extended
    attribute is used on the <code class="idl">name</code> attribute
    of the <code class="idl">Person</code> interface to indicate
    that assignments to that attribute result in assignments to the
    <code class="idl">full</code> attribute of the
    <code class="idl">Person</code> object:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Name {
          attribute DOMString full;
          attribute DOMString family;
          attribute DOMString given;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Person {
          [PutForwards=full] readonly attribute Name name;
          attribute unsigned short age;
        };
    </pre>

    In the ECMAScript binding, this would allow assignments to the
    <code class="idl">name</code> property:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var p = getPerson();           // Obtain an instance of Person.

        p.name = 'John Citizen';       // This statement...
        p.name.full = 'John Citizen';  // ...has the same behavior as this one.
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="Replaceable" extended-attribute lt="Replaceable">[Replaceable]</h4>

If the [{{Replaceable}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on a [=read only=]
[=regular attribute=],
it indicates that setting the corresponding property on the
[=platform object=] will result in
an own property with the same name being created on the object
which has the value being assigned.  This property will shadow
the accessor property corresponding to the attribute, which
exists on the [=interface prototype object=].

The [{{Replaceable}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

An attribute with the [{{Replaceable}}]
extended attribute must not also be declared
with the [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}] or
[{{PutForwards}}] extended attributes.

The [{{Replaceable}}]
extended attribute must not be used
on an [=attribute=] that
is not [=read only=].

The [{{Replaceable}}] extended attribute
must not be used on a
[=static attribute=].

The [{{Replaceable}}] extended attribute
must not be used on an attribute declared on
a [=namespace=].

See [[#es-attributes]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{Replaceable}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines an [=interface=]
    with an [=operation=]
    that increments a counter, and an [=attribute=]
    that exposes the counter’s value, which is initially 0:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Counter {
          [Replaceable] readonly attribute unsigned long value;
          undefined increment();
        };
    </pre>

    Assigning to the <code class="idl">value</code> property
    on a [=platform object=] implementing <code class="idl">Counter</code>
    will shadow the property that corresponds to the
    [=attribute=]:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var counter = getCounter();                              // Obtain an instance of Counter.
        counter.value;                                           // Evaluates to 0.

        Object.getPrototypeOf(counter).hasOwnProperty("value");  // Evaluates to true.

        counter.increment();
        counter.increment();
        counter.value;                                           // Evaluates to 2.

        counter.value = 'a';                                     // Shadows the property with one that is unrelated
                                                                 // to Counter::value.

        counter.hasOwnProperty("value");                         // Evaluates to true.

        counter.increment();
        counter.value;                                           // Evaluates to 'a'.

        delete counter.value;                                    // Reveals the original property.
        counter.value;                                           // Evaluates to 3.
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="SameObject" extended-attribute lt="SameObject">[SameObject]</h4>

If the [{{SameObject}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on a [=read only=]
[=attribute=], then it
indicates that when getting the value of the attribute on a given
object, the same value must always
be returned.

The [{{SameObject}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{SameObject}}]
extended attribute must not
be used on anything other than a [=read only=]
[=attribute=]
whose type is an [=interface type=]
or {{object}}.

<div class="example">

    As an example, this extended attribute is suitable for use on
    the {{Document/implementation}} attribute on the {{Document}} interface
    since the same object is always returned for a given
    {{Document}} object. [[DOM]]

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]

        };
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="SecureContext" extended-attribute lt="SecureContext">[SecureContext]</h4>

If the [{{SecureContext}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on an
[=interface=],
[=partial interface=],
[=interface mixin=],
[=partial interface mixin=],
[=callback interface=],
[=namespace=],
[=partial namespace=],
[=interface member=],
[=interface mixin member=], or
[=namespace member=],
it indicates that the construct is [=exposed=]
only within a [=secure context=].
The [{{SecureContext}}] extended attribute must not be used
on any other construct.

The [{{SecureContext}}] extended attribute must [=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

If [{{SecureContext}}] appears on an [=overloaded=] [=operation=],
then it must appear on all overloads.

The [{{SecureContext}}] [=extended attribute=] must not be specified both on

* an [=interface member=] and its [=interface=] or [=partial interface=];
* an [=interface mixin member=] and its [=interface mixin=] or [=partial interface mixin=];
* a [=namespace member=] and its [=namespace=] or [=partial namespace=].

Note: This is because adding the [{{SecureContext}}] [=extended attribute=] on a [=member=] when
its containing definition is also annotated with the [{{SecureContext}}] [=extended attribute=]
does not further restrict the exposure of the [=member=].

An [=interface=] without the [{{SecureContext}}] [=extended attribute=]
must not [=interface/inherit=] from another interface
that does specify [{{SecureContext}}].

[{{SecureContext}}] must not be specified on a construct is that is [=conditionally exposed=] on
[{{CrossOriginIsolated}}]. (Doing so would be redundant, since every environment which is
[=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability|cross-origin isolated=] is also a
[=secure context=].)

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface

<h4 id="Unscopable" extended-attribute lt="Unscopable">[Unscopable]</h4>

If the [{{Unscopable}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on a [=regular attribute=]
or [=regular operation=], it
indicates that an object that [=implements=] an interface with the given
interface member will not include its property name in any object
environment record with it as its base object.  The result of this is
that bare identifiers matching the property name will not resolve to
the property in a <code>with</code> statement.  This is achieved by
including the property name on the
[=interface prototype object=]’s
{{@@unscopables}} property’s value.

The [{{Unscopable}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{Unscopable}}]
extended attribute must not appear on
anything other than a [=regular attribute=]
or [=regular operation=].

The [{{Unscopable}}] extended attribute must not be used on an attribute declared on a

<h3 id="es-legacy-extended-attributes">Legacy extended attributes</h3>

This section defines a number of [=extended attributes=] whose presence affects the ECMAScript
binding. Unlike those in [[#es-extended-attributes]], these exist only so that legacy Web platform
features can be specified. They should not be used in specifications, unless required to specify the
behavior of legacy APIs.

Editors who believe they have a good reason for using these extended attributes are strongly advised
to discuss this by
<a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/new?title=Intent%20to%20use%20a%20legacy%20extended%20attribute">filing an issue</a>
before proceeding.


<h4 id="LegacyFactoryFunction" extended-attribute lt="LegacyFactoryFunction" oldids="NamedConstructor">[LegacyFactoryFunction]</h4>

<p class="advisement">Instead of using this feature, give your interface a [=constructor operation=].</p>

If the [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on an [=interface=],
it indicates that the ECMAScript global object will have a property with the
specified name whose value is a function that can
create objects that implement the interface.
Multiple [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] extended
attributes may appear on a given interface.

The [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] extended attribute must
[=takes a named argument list|take a named argument list=].
The <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> that occurs directly after the
“<emu-t>=</emu-t>” is the [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]'s <dfn lt="LegacyFactoryFunction identifier">identifier</dfn>.
For each [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] extended attribute on the interface,
there will be a way to construct an object that
[=implements=] the interface by passing the specified arguments to the [=constructor=]
that is the value of the aforementioned property.

The [=LegacyFactoryFunction identifier|identifier=] used for the legacy factory function must not
be the same as that used by a [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]
extended attribute on another interface, must not
be the same as an [=LegacyWindowAlias identifier|identifier=] used by a [{{LegacyWindowAlias}}]
extended attribute on this interface or another interface,
must not be the same as an [=identifier=] of an interface
that has an [=interface object=],
and must not be one of the
[=reserved identifiers=].

The [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] and [{{Global}}] [=extended attributes=] must not be specified on the
same [=interface=].

See [[#legacy-factory-functions]] for details on how legacy factory functions
are to be implemented.

<div class="example">

    The following IDL defines an interface that uses the
    [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] extended
    attribute.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window,
         LegacyFactoryFunction=Audio(DOMString src)]
        interface HTMLAudioElement : HTMLMediaElement {
          // ...
        };
    </pre>

    An ECMAScript implementation that supports this interface will
    allow the construction of <code class="idl">HTMLAudioElement</code>
    objects using the <code class="idl">Audio</code> function.

    <pre highlight="js">
        typeof Audio;                   // Evaluates to 'function'.

        var a2 = new Audio('a.flac');   // Creates an HTMLAudioElement using the
                                        // one-argument constructor.
    </pre>

    As an additional legacy quirk, these factory functions will have a <code>prototype</code>
    property equal to the <code>prototype</code> of the original interface:

    <pre highlight="js">
        console.assert(Audio.prototype === HTMLAudioElement.prototype);
    </pre>
</div>


<h4 id="LegacyLenientSetter" extended-attribute lt="LegacyLenientSetter" oldids="LenientSetter">[LegacyLenientSetter]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}]
[=extended attribute=]

[=regular attribute=],
it indicates that a no-op setter will be generated for the attribute’s
accessor property.  This results in erroneous assignments to the property
in strict mode to be ignored rather than causing an exception to be thrown.

<p class="note">Pages have been observed where authors have attempted to polyfill an IDL attribute
by assigning to the property, but have accidentally done so even if the property exists. In strict
mode, this would cause an exception to be thrown, potentially breaking page. Without
[{{LegacyLenientSetter}}], this could prevent a browser from shipping the feature.</p>

The [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}] extended attribute
must [=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].
It must not be used on anything other than
a [=read only=] [=regular attribute=].

An attribute with the [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}]
extended attribute must not also be declared
with the [{{PutForwards}}]
or [{{Replaceable}}] extended attributes.

The [{{LegacyLenientSetter}}] extended attribute must not be used on an attribute declared on a
[=namespace=].

See the <a href="#es-attributes">Attributes</a> section for how
[{{LegacyLenientSetter}}] is to be implemented.

<div class="example">

<p class="advisement">Instead of using this feature, interface names can be formed with a naming
convention of starting with a particular prefix for a set of interfaces, as part of the identifier,
without the intervening dot.</p>

If the [{{LegacyNamespace}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on an [=interface=], it indicates that
the [=interface object=] for this interface will not be created as a property of the global
object, but rather as a property of the [=namespace=] identified by the argument to the extended
attribute.

The [{{LegacyNamespace}}] extended attribute [=takes an identifier|take an identifier=].
This identifier must be the identifier of a namespace.

The [{{LegacyNamespace}}] and [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}]
extended attributes must not be specified on the same interface.

See [[#namespace-object]] for details on how an interface is exposed on a namespace.

<div class="example">
    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines a [=namespace=] and an [=interface=] which
    uses [{{LegacyNamespace}}] to be defined inside of it.

    <pre highlight="webidl">

        [LegacyNamespace=Foo]
        interface Bar {

<h4 id="LegacyNoInterfaceObject" extended-attribute lt="LegacyNoInterfaceObject" oldids="NoInterfaceObject">[LegacyNoInterfaceObject]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on an [=interface=],
it indicates that an [=interface object=]
will not exist for the interface in the ECMAScript binding.

The [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] extended attribute
must [=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] extended attribute
must not be specified on an interface that has any
[=constructors=] or [=static operations=] defined on it.

An interface that does not have the [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] extended
attribute specified must not inherit
from an interface that has the [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] extended
attribute specified.

See [[#es-interfaces]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines two interfaces, one whose interface object
    is exposed on the ECMAScript global object, and one whose isn’t:

    <pre highlight="webidl">

        interface Query {

<h4 id="LegacyNullToEmptyString" extended-attribute lt="LegacyNullToEmptyString" oldids="TreatNullAs">[LegacyNullToEmptyString]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyNullToEmptyString}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on the {{DOMString}} or {{USVString}} type,
it creates a new IDL type such that that when an ECMAScript <emu-val>null</emu-val> is converted to the IDL type,
it will be handled differently from its default handling. Instead of being stringified to
"<code>null</code>", which is the default, it will be converted to the empty string.

The [{{LegacyNullToEmptyString}}] extended attribute must not be
[=extended attribute associated with|associated with=] a type that is not {{DOMString}} or {{USVString}}.

Note: This means that even <code class="idl">DOMString?</code> must not use [{{LegacyNullToEmptyString}}], since
<emu-val>null</emu-val> is a valid value of that type.

See [[#es-DOMString]] for the specific requirements that the use of [{{LegacyNullToEmptyString}}] entails.

<div class="example">
    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface that has one attribute whose type has the
    extended attribute, and one operation whose argument's type has the extended attribute:

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]

          boolean isMemberOfBreed([LegacyNullToEmptyString] DOMString breedName);
        };
    </pre>

    An ECMAScript implementation implementing the <code class="idl">Dog</code>
    interface would convert a <emu-val>null</emu-val> value
    assigned to the <code>owner</code> property or passed as the
    argument to the <code>isMemberOfBreed</code> function
    to the empty string rather than "<code>null</code>":

        d.owner = null;           // This assigns the string "" to the .owner property.

        d.isMemberOfBreed(null);  // This passes the string "" to the isMemberOfBreed

<h4 id="LegacyOverrideBuiltIns" extended-attribute lt="LegacyOverrideBuiltIns" oldids="OverrideBuiltins">[LegacyOverrideBuiltIns]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}]
[=extended attribute=]
appears on an [=interface=],
it indicates that for a [=legacy platform object=] implementing the interface,
properties corresponding to all of
the object’s [=supported property names=]
will appear to be on the object,
regardless of what other properties exist on the object or its
prototype chain.  This means that named properties will always shadow
any properties that would otherwise appear on the object.
This is in contrast to the usual behavior, which is for named properties
to be exposed only if there is no property with the
same name on the object itself or somewhere on its prototype chain.

The [{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}]
extended attribute must
[=takes no arguments|take no arguments=]
and must not appear on an interface
that does not define a [=named property getter=]
or that also is declared with the [{{Global}}] [=extended attribute=].
If the extended attribute is specified on
a [=partial interface=]
definition, then that partial interface definition must
be the part of the interface definition that defines
the [=named property getter=].

If the [{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}] extended attribute is specified on a
[=partial interface=] definition, it is considered to appear on the
[=interface=] itself.

See [[#es-legacy-platform-objects]]
and [[#legacy-platform-object-defineownproperty]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{LegacyOverrideBuiltIns}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]

          readonly attribute unsigned long length;
          getter DOMString lookup(DOMString key);
        };
    </pre>

    In an ECMAScript implementation of these two interfaces,
    getting certain properties on objects implementing
    the interfaces will result in different values:

    <pre highlight="js">
        // Obtain an instance of StringMap.  Assume that it has "abc", "length" and

        var map1 = getStringMap();

        // This invokes the named property getter.
        map1.abc;

        // This fetches the "length" property on the object that corresponds to the

        map2.length;

        // This too invokes the named property getter, despite the fact that "toString" is

<h4 id="LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull" extended-attribute lt="LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull" oldids="TreatNonObjectAsNull">[LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on a [=callback function=], then
it indicates that any value assigned to an [=attribute=] whose type is a [=nullable type|nullable=]
[=callback function=] will be converted more loosely: if the value is not an object, it will be
converted to null, and if the value is not [=ECMAScript/callable=], it will be converted to a
[=callback function=] value that does nothing when called.

See [[#es-nullable-type]], [[#es-callback-function]] and [[#es-invoking-callback-functions]]
for the specific requirements that the use of
[{{LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull}}] entails.

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=] defines an interface that has one
    attribute whose type is a [{{LegacyTreatNonObjectAsNull}}]-annotated

    In an ECMAScript implementation, assigning a value that is not
    an object (such as a Number value), or that is not [=ECMAScript/callable=]
    to handler1 will have different behavior from that when assigning
    to handler2:

<h4 id="LegacyUnforgeable" extended-attribute lt="LegacyUnforgeable" oldids="Unforgeable">[LegacyUnforgeable]</h4>

If the [{{LegacyUnforgeable}}] [=extended attribute=] appears on
[=regular attributes=] or non-[=static operations|static=] [=operations=],
it indicates that the attribute or operation
will be reflected as an ECMAScript property
in a way that means its behavior cannot be modified
and that performing a property lookup on the object
will always result in the attribute’s property value being returned.
In particular, the property will be non-configurable
and will exist as an own property on the object itself
rather than on its prototype.

An attribute or operation is said to be
<dfn id="dfn-unforgeable-on-an-interface" export>unforgeable</dfn> on a given interface |A|
if the attribute or operation is declared on |A|,
and is annotated with the [{{LegacyUnforgeable}}] [=extended attribute=].

The [{{LegacyUnforgeable}}] extended attribute must [=takes no arguments|take no arguments=].

The [{{LegacyUnforgeable}}] [=extended attribute=] must not appear
on anything other than a [=regular attribute=]
or a non-[=static operations|static=] [=operation=].
If it does appear on an [=operation=],
then it must appear on all operations
with the same [=identifier=] on that interface.

The [{{LegacyUnforgeable}}] extended attribute must not be used
on an attribute declared on a [=namespace=].

If an attribute or operation |X| is [=unforgeable=] on an interface |A|,
and |A| is one of the [=inherited interfaces=] of another interface |B|,
then |B| must not have a [=regular attribute=]

whose value is the [=interface object=] for the interface.

The [{{LegacyWindowAlias}}] extended attribute must either
[=takes an identifier|take an identifier=] or
[=takes an identifier list|take an identifier list=].
The <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t>s that occur after the

Each of the [=LegacyWindowAlias identifier|identifiers=] of [{{LegacyWindowAlias}}]

    and a list of IDL values or the special value “missing”.  The algorithm behaves as follows:

    1.  Let |maxarg| be the length of the longest type list of the entries in |S|.
    1.  Let |n| be the [=list/size=] of |args|.
    1.  Initialize |argcount| to be min(|maxarg|, |n|).
    1.  Remove from |S| all entries whose type list is not of length |argcount|.
    1.  If |S| is empty, then [=ECMAScript/throw=] a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}}.
    1.  Initialize |d| to −1.
    1.  Initialize |method| to <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>.
    1.  If there is more than one entry in |S|, then set
        |d| to be the [=distinguishing argument index=]
        for the entries of |S|.
    1.  Initialize |values| to be an empty list, where each entry will be either an IDL value or the special value “missing”.
    1.  Initialize |i| to 0.
    1.  While |i| &lt; |d|:
        1.  Let |V| be |args|[|i|].
        1.  Let |type| be the type at index |i| in the type list of any entry in |S|.

            Note: All entries in |S| at this point have the same type and [=optionality value=] at index |i|.

        1.  Let |optionality| be the value at index |i| in the list of [=optionality values=] of any entry in |S|.
        1.  If |optionality| is “optional” and |V| is <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>, then:
            1.  If the argument at index |i| is declared with a [=optional argument/default value=],
                then append to |values| that default value.
            1.  Otherwise, append to |values| the special value “missing”.
        1.  Otherwise, append to |values| the result of [=converted to an IDL value|converting=]
            |V| to IDL type |type|.
        1.  Set |i| to |i| + 1.
    1.  If |i| = |d|, then:
        1.  Let |V| be |args|[|i|].

            Note: This is the argument that will be used to resolve which overload is selected.

        1.  If |V| is <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>, and there is an entry in |S|
            whose list of [=optionality values=] has “optional” at index |i|,
            then remove from |S| all other entries.

        1.  Otherwise: if |V| is <emu-val>null</emu-val> or <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>,
            and there is an entry in |S| that has one of the following types at position |i| of its type list,

<div class="note">

    The overload resolution algorithm performs both the identification
    of which overloaded operation, constructor, etc. is being called,
    and the conversion of the ECMAScript argument values to their
    corresponding IDL values.  Informally, it operates as follows.

    First, the selection of valid overloads is done by considering
    the number of ECMAScript arguments that were passed in to the function:

    *   If there are more arguments passed in than the longest
        overload argument list, then they are ignored.
    *   After ignoring these trailing arguments, only overloads
        that can take this exact number of arguments are considered.
        If there are none, then a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}} is thrown.

    Once we have a set of possible overloads with the right number
    of arguments, the ECMAScript values are converted from left to right.
    The nature of the restrictions on overloading means that if we
    have multiple possible overloads at this point, then there will
    be one position in the argument list that will be used to
    distinguish which overload we will finally select; this is
    the [=distinguishing argument index=].

    We first convert the arguments to the left of the distinguishing
    argument.  (There is a requirement that an argument to the left of
    the distinguishing argument index has the same type as in the other
    overloads, at the same index.) Then we inspect the type of the
    ECMAScript value that is passed in at the distinguishing argument
    index to determine which IDL type it may correspond to.
    This allows us to select the final overload that will
    be invoked.  If the value passed in is <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>
    and there is an overload with an optional argument at this position, then
    we will choose that overload.  If there is no valid overload for the type of
    value passed in here, then we throw a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}}.
    Generally, the inspection of the value at the distinguishing argument index does not have any
    side effects, and the only side effects in the overload resolution algorithm are the result of
    converting the ECMAScript values to IDL values.
    (An exception exists when one of the overloads has a [=sequence type=] or [=frozen array type=]
    at the distinguishing argument index.
    In this case, we attempt to get the {{@@iterator}} property to determine the appropriate
    overload, and perform the conversion of the distinguishing argument separately before continuing
    with the next step.)

    At this point, we have determined which overload to use.  We now
    convert the remaining arguments, from the distinguishing argument onwards,
    again ignoring any additional arguments that were ignored due to being passed
    after the last possible argument.

    When converting an optional argument’s ECMAScript value to its equivalent IDL value,
    <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> will be converted into
    the [=optional argument/default value|optional argument’s default value=],
    if it has one, or a special value “missing” otherwise.

    Optional arguments corresponding to a final, variadic argument do not treat
    <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> as a special “missing” value, however.
    The <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> value is converted to the type
    of variadic argument as would be done for a non-optional argument.

<h3 id="es-interfaces">Interfaces</h3>

For every [=interface=] that is [=exposed=] in
a given [=Realm=] and that is not declared with
the [{{LegacyNoInterfaceObject}}] or [{{LegacyNamespace}}] [=extended attributes=],
a corresponding property exists on the [=Realm=]'s [=Realm/global object=].
The name of the property is the [=identifier=] of the interface,
and its value is an object called the <dfn id="dfn-interface-object" export>interface object</dfn>.
The characteristics of an interface object are described in [[#interface-object]].

If the [{{LegacyWindowAlias}}] extended attribute was specified on an [=exposed=] interface,
then for each [=LegacyWindowAlias identifier|identifier=] in [{{LegacyWindowAlias}}]'s [=LegacyWindowAlias identifier|identifiers=]
there exists a corresponding property on the {{Window}} global object.
The name of the property is the given [=LegacyWindowAlias identifier|identifier=],
and its value is a reference to the [=interface object=] for the [=interface=].

In addition, for every [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}] extended attribute on an [=exposed=] interface,
a corresponding property exists on the ECMAScript global object.
The name of the property is the [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]'s [=LegacyFactoryFunction identifier|identifier=],
and its value is an object called a <dfn id="dfn-legacy-factory-function" export oldids="dfn-named-constructor">legacy factory function</dfn>,
which allows creation of objects that implement the interface.
The characteristics of a legacy factory function are described in [[#legacy-factory-functions]].


<h4 id="interface-object" oldids="es-interface-call,es-constructible-interfaces">Interface object</h4>

The [=interface object=] for a given [=interface=] is a [=built-in function object=].
It has properties that correspond to the [=constants=] and [=static operations=]
defined on that interface,
as described in sections [[#es-constants]] and [[#es-operations]].

If the [=interface=] is declared with a [=constructor operation=],
then the [=interface object=] can be called as a [=constructor=]
to create an object that [=implements=] that interface.
Calling that interface as a function will throw an exception.

[=Interface objects=] whose [=interfaces=] are not declared
with a [=constructor operation=] will throw when called,
both as a function and as a [=constructor=].

An [=interface object=] for an [=interface=]
has an associated object called the [=interface prototype object=].
This object has properties that correspond to
the [=regular attributes=] and [=regular operations=] defined on the interface,
and is described in more detail in [[#interface-prototype-object]].

Note: Since an [=interface object=] is a [=function object=]
the <code>typeof</code> operator will return "function" when applied to an interface object.

An interface may have <dfn export>overridden constructor steps</dfn>, which can
change the behavior of the [=interface object=] when called or constructed. By
default interfaces do not have such steps.

<p class="advisement">
    In general, constructors are described by defining a [=constructor operation=] and its behavior.
    The [=overridden constructor steps=] are used only for more complicated situations.

Note: Although there is only a single property for an IDL attribute, since
accessor property getters and setters are passed a [=this=]
value for the object on which property corresponding to the IDL attribute is
accessed, they are able to expose instance-specific data.

Note: Attempting to assign to a property corresponding to a
[=read only=] [=attribute=]
results in different behavior depending on whether the script doing so is in strict mode.
When in strict mode, such an assignment will result in a {{ECMAScript/TypeError}}
being thrown.  When not in strict mode, the assignment attempt will be ignored.

  The set of interfaces that a [=platform object=] [=implements=] does not change over

  [=Interface mixins=] do not participate directly in the evaluation of the [=implements=]

<h3 id="es-legacy-platform-objects" oldids="indexed-and-named-properties">Legacy platform objects</h3>

[=Legacy platform objects=] will appear to have additional properties that correspond to their
[=indexed properties|indexed=] and [=named properties=].  These properties are not “real” own
properties on the object, but are made to look like they are by being exposed
by the <a href="#legacy-platform-object-getownproperty">\[[GetOwnProperty]] internal method</a> .

It is permissible for an object to implement multiple interfaces that support indexed properties.
However, if so, and there are conflicting definitions as to the object’s
[=supported property indices=],
then it is undefined what additional properties the object will appear to
have, or what its exact behavior will be with regard to its indexed properties.
The same applies for named properties.

The [=indexed property getter=]
that is defined on the derived-most interface that the
legacy platform object implements is the one that defines the behavior
when indexing the object with an [=array index=].  Similarly for
[=indexed property setters=].
This way, the definitions of these special operations from
ancestor interfaces can be overridden.

A property name is an <dfn id="dfn-unforgeable-property-name" export>unforgeable property name</dfn> on a
given platform object |O| if the object implements an [=interface=] that
has an [=interface member=] with that identifier
and that interface member is [=unforgeable=] on any of
the interfaces that |O| implements.

Support for [=getters=] is handled in [[#legacy-platform-object-getownproperty]],
and for [=setters=] in [[#legacy-platform-object-defineownproperty]]
and [[#legacy-platform-object-set]].

Additionally, [=legacy platform objects=] have internal methods as defined in:

<h3 id="es-observable-arrays">Observable array exotic objects</h3>

An <dfn>observable array exotic object</dfn> is a specific type of ECMAScript
[=Proxy exotic object=] which is created using the proxy traps defined in this section. They are
defined in this manner because the ECMAScript specification includes special treatment for
[=Proxy exotic objects=] that have <code>Array</code> instances as their proxy target, and we want
to ensure that [=observable array types=] are exposed to ECMAScript code with this special treatment
intact.

The proxy traps used by observable array exotic objects work to ensure a number of invariants beyond
those of normal <code>Array</code> instances:

*   The arrays have no holes, i.e. every property in the inclusive range 0 through
    <code>observableArray.length</code> &minus; 1 will be filled with a value compatible with the
    specified Web IDL type, and no [=array index=] properties will exist outside that range.
*   The property descriptors for important properties cannot be changed from their default
    configuration; indexed properties always remain as configurable, enumerable, and writable data
    properties, while the <code>length</code> property remains as a non-configurable,
    non-enumerable, and writable data property.
*   Adding additional properties to the array cannot be prevented using, for example,
    <code>Object.preventExtensions()</code>.

For every [=callback interface=] that is [=exposed=] in
a given [=Realm=]

a corresponding property exists on the [=Realm=]'s [=Realm/global object=].
The name of the property is the [=identifier=] of the [=callback interface=],

it should also expose those on {{DOMException}} instances.

    The above algorithms restrict [=Exception objects|objects representing exceptions=] propagating
    out of a [=function object=] to be ones that are associated with the [=Realm=] of that
    [=function object=] (i.e., the [=current Realm=] at the time the function

    If we apply <code class="idl">computeSquareRoot</code> to a <code class="idl">MathUtils</code>

<h4 id="es-handling-exceptions">Handling exceptions</h4>

Unless specified otherwise,
whenever ECMAScript runtime semantics are invoked due
to requirements in this document and
end due to an exception being thrown, that exception
must propagate to the caller, and if
not caught there, to its caller, and so on.

Per [[#conventions]], an algorithm specified in this document may intercept thrown exceptions, either by specifying
the exact steps to take if <dfn>an exception was thrown</dfn>, or by explicitly handling [=abrupt completions=].

<div class="example">

    The following [=IDL fragment=]
    defines two [=interfaces=]
    and an [=exception=].
    The <code>valueOf</code> attribute on <code class="idl">ExceptionThrower</code>
    is defined to throw an exception whenever an attempt is made
    to get its value.

    <pre highlight="webidl">
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Dahut {
          attribute DOMString type;
        };

        [Exposed=Window]
        interface ExceptionThrower {
          // This attribute always throws a NotSupportedError and never returns a value.
          attribute long valueOf;
        };
    </pre>

    Assuming an ECMAScript implementation supporting this interface,
    the following code demonstrates how exceptions are handled:

    <pre highlight="js">
        var d = getDahut();              // Obtain an instance of Dahut.
        var et = getExceptionThrower();  // Obtain an instance of ExceptionThrower.

        try {
          d.type = { toString: function() { throw "abc"; } };
        } catch (e) {
          // The string "abc" is caught here, since as part of the conversion
          // from the native object to a string, the anonymous function
          // was invoked, and none of the [[DefaultValue]], ToPrimitive or
          // ToString algorithms are defined to catch the exception.
        }

        try {
          d.type = { toString: { } };
        } catch (e) {
          // An exception is caught here, since an attempt is made to invoke
          // [[Call]] on the native object that is the value of toString
          // property.
        }

        try {
          d.type = Symbol();
        } catch (e) {
          // An exception is caught here, since an attempt is made to invoke
          // the ECMAScript ToString abstract operation on a Symbol value.
        }

        d.type = et;
        // An uncaught "NotSupportedError" DOMException is thrown here, since the
        // [[DefaultValue]] algorithm attempts to get the value of the
        // "valueOf" property on the ExceptionThrower object.  The exception
        // propagates out of this block of code.

Note: as discussed in [[#es-DOMException-specialness]], the ECMAScript binding imposes additional
requirements beyond the normal ones for [=interface types=].

Each {{DOMException}} object has an associated <dfn for="DOMException">name</dfn> and
<dfn for="DOMException">message</dfn>, both [=strings=].

The
<dfn constructor for="DOMException" lt="DOMException(message, name)"><code>new DOMException(|message|, |name|)</code></dfn>
constructor steps are:

1. Set [=this=]'s [=DOMException/name=] to |name|.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=DOMException/message=] to |message|.

The <dfn attribute for="DOMException"><code>name</code></dfn> getter steps are to return
[=this=]'s [=DOMException/name=].

The <dfn attribute for="DOMException"><code>message</code></dfn> getter steps are to
return [=this=]'s [=DOMException/message=].

The <dfn attribute for="DOMException"><code>code</code></dfn> getter steps are to return the legacy
code indicated in the [=error names table=] for [=this=]'s [=DOMException/name=], or 0 if no such
entry exists in the table.

{{DOMException}} objects are [=serializable objects=].

Their [=serialization steps=], given <var>value</var> and <var>serialized</var>, are:

<ol>
    <li>Set <var>serialized</var>.\[[Name]] to <var>value</var>'s [=DOMException/name=].</li>

The {{DOMTimeStamp}} type is used for representing
a number of milliseconds, either as an absolute time (relative to some epoch)

with the group responsible for work on <cite>Web IDL</cite>, which
at the time of writing is the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">W3C Web Platform Working Group</a>,
for possible inclusion in a future version of this document.

Extensions to any other aspect of the IDL language are
strongly discouraged.


<h2 id="legacy-constructs">Legacy constructs</h4>

<i>This section is informative.</i>

Legacy WebIDL constructs exist only so that
legacy Web platform features can be specified.
They are generally prefixed with the "<code>Legacy</code>" string.
It is strongly discouraged to use legacy WebIDL constructs in specifications
unless required to specify the behavior of legacy Web platform features,
or for consistency with such features.
Editors who wish to use legacy WebIDL constructs are strongly advised to discuss this
by <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/new?title=Intent%20to%20use%20a%20legacy%20WebIDL%20construct">filing an issue</a>
before proceeding.

Marking a construct as legacy does not, in itself,
imply that it is about to be removed from this specification.
It does suggest however, that it is a good candidate
for future removal from this specification,
whenever various heuristics indicate that
the Web platform features it helps specify can be removed altogether
or can be modified to rely on non-legacy WebIDL constructs instead.


<h2 id="referencing">Referencing this specification</h2>

<i>This section is informative.</i>

It is expected that other specifications that define Web platform interfaces
using one or more [=IDL fragments=]
will reference this specification.  It is suggested
that those specifications include a sentence such as the following,
to indicate that the IDL is to be interpreted as described in this
specification:

<blockquote>

    The IDL fragment in Appendix A of this specification must, in conjunction
    with the IDL fragments defined in this specification's normative references,
    be interpreted as required for <em>conforming sets of IDL fragments</em>, as described in the
    “Web IDL” specification. \[WEBIDL]

</blockquote>

In addition, it is suggested that the conformance class for user
agents in referencing specifications be linked to the
[=conforming implementation=] class from this specification:

<blockquote>

    A conforming FooML user agent must also be a
    <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragment in Appendix A
    of this specification, as described in the
    “Web IDL” specification. \[WEBIDL]

</blockquote>


<h2 id="priv-sec">Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>

This specification defines a conversion layer between JavaScript and IDL values. An incorrect
implementation of this layer can lead to security issues.

This specification also provides the ability to use JavaScript values directly, through the
{{any}} and {{object}} IDL types. These values need to be handled carefully to avoid security
issues. In particular, user script can run in response to nearly any manipulation of these values,
and invalidate the expectations of specifications or implementations using them.

This specification makes it possible to interact with {{SharedArrayBuffer}} objects, which can be
used to build timing attacks. Specifications that use these objects need to consider such attacks.

<h2 id="idl-grammar" class="no-num">IDL grammar</h2>

This section defines an LL(1) grammar whose start symbol,
<emu-nt><a href="#prod-Definitions">Definitions</a></emu-nt>, matches an
entire [=IDL fragment=].

Each production in the grammar has on its right hand side either a
non-zero sequence of terminal and non-terminal symbols, or an
epsilon (ε) which indicates no symbols.
Symbols that begin with an uppercase letter are non-terminal symbols.
Symbols in monospaced fonts are terminal symbols.
Symbols in sans-serif font that begin with a lowercase letter are terminal
symbols that are matched by the regular expressions (using Perl 5 regular
expression syntax [[!PERLRE]]) as follows:

<table class="grammar data">
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-integer"><emu-t class="regex">integer</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>-?([1-9][0-9]*|0[Xx][0-9A-Fa-f]+|0[0-7]*)<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-decimal"><emu-t class="regex">decimal</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>-?(([0-9]+\.[0-9]*|[0-9]*\.[0-9]+)([Ee][+-]?[0-9]+)?|[0-9]+[Ee][+-]?[0-9]+)<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-identifier"><emu-t class="regex">identifier</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>[_-]?[A-Za-z][0-9A-Z_a-z-]*<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-string"><emu-t class="regex">string</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>"[^"]*"<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-whitespace"><emu-t class="regex">whitespace</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>[\t\n\r ]+<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-comment"><emu-t class="regex">comment</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span><span class="mute">\</span>/<span class="mute">\</span>/.*|<span class="mute">\</span>/\*(.|\n)*?\*<span class="mute">\</span>/<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="prod-other"><emu-t class="regex">other</emu-t></td>
        <td><code>=</code></td>
        <td><code class="regex"><span class="mute">/</span>[^\t\n\r 0-9A-Za-z]<span class="mute">/</span></code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The tokenizer operates on a sequence of Unicode characters
[[!UNICODE]].
When tokenizing, the longest possible match must be used.  For example, if the input
text is “<span class="input">a1</span>”, it is tokenized as a single <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t>,
and not as a separate <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> and <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-integer">integer</a></emu-t>.
If the longest possible match could match one of the above named terminal symbols or
one of the other terminal symbols from the grammar, it must be tokenized as the latter.
Thus, the input text “<span class="input">long</span>” is tokenized as the quoted terminal symbol
<emu-t>long</emu-t> rather than an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> called "<code>long</code>",
and “<span class="input">.</span>” is tokenized as the quoted terminal symbol
<emu-t>.</emu-t> rather than an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-other">other</a></emu-t>.

The IDL syntax is case sensitive, both for the quoted terminal symbols
used in the grammar and the values used for
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> terminals.  Thus, for
example, the input text “<span class="input">Const</span>” is tokenized as
an <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-identifier">identifier</a></emu-t> rather than the
terminal symbol <emu-t>const</emu-t>, an
[=interface=] with
[=identifier=]
"<code>A</code>" is distinct from one named "<code>a</code>", and an
[=extended attribute=]
[<code class="idl">legacyfactoryfunction</code>] will not be recognized as
the [{{LegacyFactoryFunction}}]
extended attribute.

Implicitly, any number of <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-whitespace">whitespace</a></emu-t> and
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-comment">comment</a></emu-t> terminals are allowed between every other terminal
in the input text being parsed.  Such <emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-whitespace">whitespace</a></emu-t> and
<emu-t class="regex"><a href="#prod-comment">comment</a></emu-t> terminals are ignored while parsing.

The following LL(1) grammar, starting with <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Definitions">Definitions</a></emu-nt>,
matches an [=IDL fragment=]:

<div data-fill-with="grammar-index"></div>

Note: The <emu-nt><a href="#prod-Other">Other</a></emu-nt>
non-terminal matches any single terminal symbol except for
<emu-t>(</emu-t>, <emu-t>)</emu-t>,
<emu-t>[</emu-t>, <emu-t>]</emu-t>,
<emu-t>{</emu-t>, <emu-t>}</emu-t>
and <emu-t>,</emu-t>.

While the <emu-nt><a href="#prod-ExtendedAttribute">ExtendedAttribute</a></emu-nt>
non-terminal matches any non-empty sequence of terminal symbols (as long as any
parentheses, square brackets or braces are balanced, and the
<emu-t>,</emu-t> token appears only within those balanced brackets),
only a subset of those
possible sequences are used by the [=extended attributes=]
defined in this specification — see
[[#idl-extended-attributes]]
for the syntaxes that are used by these extended attributes.


<h2 id="conventions" class="no-num">Document conventions</h3>

The following typographic conventions are used in this document:

*   Defining instances of terms: <dfn id="dfn-example-term">example term</dfn>
*   Links to terms defined in this document or elsewhere: [=example term=]
*   Grammar terminals: <emu-t>sometoken</emu-t>
*   Grammar non-terminals: <emu-nt>ExampleGrammarNonTerminal</emu-t>
*   Grammar symbols: <emu-t class="regex">identifier</emu-t>
*   IDL types: {{unsigned long}}
*   ECMAScript classes: {{ECMAScript/Map}}
*   ECMAScript language types: Object
*   Code snippets: <code>a = b + obj.f()</code>
*   Unicode characters: <span class="char">U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ("0")</span>
*   Extended attributes: [<code class="idl">ExampleExtendedAttribute</code>]
*   Variable names in prose and algorithms: <var ignore>exampleVariableName</var>.
*   IDL informal syntax examples:
    <pre highlight="webidl" class="syntax">
        [extended_attributes]
        interface identifier {
          <mark>/* interface_members... */</mark>
        };
    </pre>

    (Specific parts of the syntax discussed in surrounding prose are <mark>highlighted</mark>.)
*   IDL grammar snippets:
    <pre class="grammar no-index">
        ExampleGrammarNonTerminal :
            OtherNonTerminal "sometoken"
            other AnotherNonTerminal
            ε  // nothing
    </pre>
*   Non-normative notes:

    Note: This is a note.

*   Non-normative examples:
    <div class="example">
        This is an example.
    </div>
*   Normative warnings:
    <p class="advisement">
        This is a warning.
    </p>
*   Code blocks:
    <pre highlight="webidl">
        // This is an IDL code block.
        [Exposed=Window]
        interface Example {
          attribute long something;
        };
    </pre>
    <pre highlight="js">
        // This is an ECMAScript code block.
        window.onload = function() { window.alert("loaded"); };
    </pre>

The following conventions are used in the algorithms in this document:

*   Algorithms use the [=ECMAScript/conventions=] of the ECMAScript specification,
    including the [=!=] and [=?=] notation for unwrapping [=Completion Records=].
*   Algorithms sometimes treat returning/throwing values and returning [=Completion Records=]
    interchangeably. That is, an algorithm that uses return/throw terminology may be treated as
    returning a [=Completion Record=], while one that returns a [=Completion Record=] may be treated as
    returning a value or throwing an exception. Similarly, to catch exceptions, defining the
    behavior to adopt when [=an exception was thrown=] and checking if the [=Completion Record=]’s
    \[[Type]] field is “throw” are equivalent.
*   [=Completion Records=] are extended by allowing them to contain values that are not ECMAScript
    values, such as Web IDL values.
