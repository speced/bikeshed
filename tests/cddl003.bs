The CDDL {#cddl}
================

CDDL specified for the <dfn data-cddl-module=local>local end</dfn>:

<xmp class=cddl data-cddl-module=local>
agent-capability = &(
  receive-audio: 1
  receive-video: 2
  receive-presentation: 3
  control-presentation: 4
  receive-remote-playback: 5
  control-remote-playback: 6
  receive-streaming: 7
  send-streaming: 8
)
</xmp>

CDDL specified for the <dfn data-cddl-module=remote>remote end</dfn>:

<xmp class=cddl data-cddl-module=remote>
webExtension.ExtensionBase64Encoded = {
  type: "base64",
  value: text,
}
</xmp>

CDDL specified for all modules:

<xmp class=cddl>
barewords = {
  bare: [+ float],
  "word": int,
}

anon1 = [("v1" / "v2")]
anon2 = {
  key: "v1" / "v2" / "unique"
}

nested = {
  key1: {
    key2: "nested"
  }
}

warn = [ (dupl: "val"), "dupl" ]
</xmp>

Linking to the CDDL {#links}
============================

The {^agent-capability^} production gives information about agent capabilities.

: {^agent-capability/receive-audio^}
:: The agent can receive audio
: {^agent-capability/receive-video^}
:: The agent can receive video
: {^agent-capability/receive-presentation|Alt text to receive-presentation^}
:: The agent can receive a presentation

Barewords and strings are treated the same way. For example, {^bare^} and {^"bare"^} both link to the same key definition. Same thing for {^word^} and {^"word"^}.

If there is no ambiguity, a key or value may be referenced directly, for example `{^"unique"^}` to target the "unique" value of anon2/key: {^"unique"^}.

Otherwise, full path must be specified, as in `{^anon1/"v1"^}`, `{^anon2/key/"v2"^}`, `{^nested/key1/key2/"nested"^}`: {^anon1/"v1"^}, {^anon2/key/"v2"^}, {^nested/key1/key2/"nested"^}.

In particular, partial paths such as `{^key/"unique"^}` or `{^key2/"nested"^}` do not work: {^key/"unique"^}, {^key2/"nested"^} (Bikeshed reports `No 'cddl' refs found` messages in such cases).

The {^warn^} type defines both a key and a value "dupl". Bikeshed reports a warning to the console to suggest creating additional CDDL types, because the shorthand `{^warn/dupl^}` can no longer be used. It remains possible to reference either construct by expliciting the link type, i.e., `<a cddl-key for=warn>dupl</a>` and `<a cddl-value for=warn>dupl</a>`: <a cddl-key for=warn>dupl</a>, <a cddl-value for=warn>dupl</a>.
