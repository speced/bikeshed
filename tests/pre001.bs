<pre>
foo
bar
	tab-indented
    four-space indented
baz
</pre>

	<pre>
	Indented element,
	content at same level.
		This line is further indented.
	Back to the initial indentation.
	</pre>

	<pre>
		Another indented element,
		but now the content is indented a level past the element.
			This line is further indented,
		and now we're back.
	</pre>

	<pre>
		This line is indented further than the content is in general.
	Here's the normal indentation:
	these lines should be against the edge.
		This line is indented again.
	And back to normal.
	</pre>

	<pre>
		This is twice-indented.
	This is once-indented.
And this line is not indented - it's even indented less than the element.
	Once again.
		Twice again.
	</pre>
