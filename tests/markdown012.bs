Basic Usage {#a}
===========

* [link]() missing link and title is fine
* [link](/uri) this is normal
* [link](/url "title") link and title
* [link]("title") missing link, only title is OK
* [link](/url 'title') single quotes okay for title
* [link]('title') single quotes with no link
* [link](/url (title)) parens okay in title
* [link]((parens)) single quotes with no link
* [link](#fragment) fragment-only url allowed
* [link](http://example.com#fragment) fragment allowed
* [link](http://example.com?foo=3#frag) query allowed
* [link](foo%20b&auml;) URL escapes, html escapes all allowed
* [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_&lpar;computer_security&rpar;) - html entities for '(' and ')'
* [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)and(Other)(Tricks)) - balanced parens
* [link](</uri>) link surrounded by angle brackets is fine
* [link](<spaces and ) and " and ' are fine>) you can put lots of stuff inside <>
* [link](</uri> "title") <>-wrapped, with title

Whitespace {#b}
==========
* [link](   /uri  ) Spaces around the url ok
* [link](   /uri  "title"  ) and around the title
* [link](
    /url
    "title"
    ) single linebreak between components is ok
* [link](/url "line 1
    line 2
    line 3") linebreaks in the title are ok
* [link](	/url	"foo"	) tabs are ok as whitespace

Missing Escapes {#c}
=======

These should work, but will contain extra backslashes
* [link](foo\bar) backslashes followed by a non-punc are just textual
* [link](foo\\bar) escaped slash
* [link](\"foo) starting escaped " is in the url, not the title
* [link](\'foo) same for single quote
* [link]((foo\))) balanced parens still work, but escaped ones do count
* [link](/url\.html "foo\.bar") other escaped punc is allowed

These won't work, the lack of escaping breaks the parsing.
* [link](\(foo) same for parens
* [link]("foo\"") can escape the " inside a title
* [link]('foo\'') or the '
* [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_\(computer_security\)and\(Other\)\(Tricks) - escaped parens
* [link](<url\>\<>) can escape < and > inside <>-wrapped links

Errors {#d}
======
* [link] (/uri) not a link, just some weird text
* [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_((computer_security)) - unbalanced unescaped parens, not a link
* [link](/url"title") need space between the url and title
* [link](/url title) no wrapper for the title
* [link](/url title "foo") still no wrapper
* [link](<foo
    bar>) linebreak in <>-wrapped url is not allowed
* [link](</url> title) even if the link is <>-wrapped, still need title wrapper
* [link](</url>"title") even if the link is <>-wrapped, still need space between it and the title
* [link](

	/url "title") blank line *not* allowed between components
* [link](/url "line 1

	line 3") blank line not allowed in title
* [link](<url<>) no unescaped < inside of <>-wrapped links
* [link](<url<>>) not allowed even if it's balanced

HTML Parsing {#e}
============

* [can use <em>markup</em> in here](/url)
* [markup hides <br title="](/not-url)"> the md markup appropriately](/url)
* [can use [TITLE] macros in here](/url)
* [can md-escape \] square brackets in here](/url)
* [can html-escape &#x59; square brackets](/url)
* [embedding another link [foo](/bar) doesn't work](/url)
* [other shorthands like ''foo'' work](/url)
* [linking shorthands <{div}> at least parse](/url)
* [`code` spans are ok](/url)
* `[and links aren't parsed in code](/url)`
* `[code interrupts`](/url) link parsing
* [including `from inside](/not-url)`](/url)

HTML Parsing Errors {#f}
===================

* [using a naked ] inside the link text](/url) cancels the link-parse (contra to CommonMark)
* <em>starting outside [then </em> closing inside](/url) is an error
* [not <em>closing](/url) is an error
* [a link-closer </a>](/url) is an error
