<pre class=anchors>
url: https://www.example.com/; spec: EXAMPLE; type: dfn;
    text: anchor-foo
    text: anchor-bar
</pre>

<dfn lt="local-foo|local-bar">foo</dfn>

These two should get their own, separate, ref-hints: 
[=anchor-foo=] [=anchor-bar=]

These two should use the same ref-hint, so one reports its text as the other: 
[=local-foo=] [=local-bar=]
