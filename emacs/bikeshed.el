;;; bikeshed.el --- major mode for .bs docs  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode for editing Bikeshed files. It's a derived mode
;; built on top of Jason Blevins' excellent markdown-mode.el.

;; So far, all it adds on top of `markdown-mode' is syntax highlighting
;; for several forms of Bikeshed autolinking.

;; This program and all associated files are available under the same
;; terms as Bikeshed itself, CC0.
