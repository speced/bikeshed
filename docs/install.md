Installing Bikeshed
===================

If you use Bikeshed infrequently,
or are okay with requiring a network roundtrip every time you invoke Bikeshed,
you probably want to use the Bikeshed API instead <https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/>.
In return, the API version is always up-to-date,
so you don't have to remember to update things yourself.

If you want to run a local copy of Bikeshed rather than use the cgi version, you can either use the [Docker image](#docker) or [install from bikeshed from source](#from-source)

## Docker

If you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
you can run the [bikeshed Docker
container](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbai/bikeshed):


```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/specs:/data kbai/bikeshed spec Overview.bs
```

To have the `bikeshed` command available in your shell but actually run the Docker container, add
the following to your shell rc file (`$HOME/.bashrc` for bash, `$HOME/.zshrc` for zsh):

```sh
function bikeshed () { 
  docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/data kbai/bikeshed "$@"
}
```

Then you can run `bikeshed update`, `bikeshed spec` as documented.

To rebuild the Docker container image from source, have [docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), change to the root of the git repository and run

```sh
docker-compose build
```

## From source

You need to install Python 2.7, PIP, and a few other support libraries before installing Bikeshed itself. Here is how to do this on Debian-based Linuxen (anything using `apt`), OS X, and Windows 7/8/10:


### Linux steps

~~~~
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-dev python-pip python-wheel libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev
~~~~

The `apt-get` command works on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu; if you work on some other type of system, and can figure out how to get things working on your own, let me know and I'll add instructions for your system.

Then, we'll need to install lxml and Pygments.

~~~~
$ sudo pip install pygments
$ sudo pip install lxml
~~~~

**Important**: If this command reports that you already have lxml, instead run:

~~~~
$ sudo pip install lxml --upgrade
~~~~

That'll spew a lot of console trash, but don't worry about it.

From here, you can follow the commons steps outlined below.

### OS X steps

Note: If you're on a relatively modern Mac you should be able to proceed directly to [Common steps](#common-steps).

These instructions assume that you have [Mac Ports](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed. If you successfully install Bikeshed using some other method, please contribute to this documentation.

#### Mac ports

First, get the right packages installed onto your system:
~~~
sudo port install python27 py27-pip py27-lxml py27-html5lib py27-cssselect py27-libxslt py27-libxml2 py27-pygments
~~~

Then, activate the python version you just installed as the one the system should use:
~~~
sudo port select --set python python27
~~~

(If you get `ImportError: No module named six` when you first run Bikeshed, additionally run `sudo port install py27-six`.)

#### Homebrew

Install the Homebrew version of Python and Pip:
~~~
brew install python
~~~

Install the XCode command-line tools:
~~~
xcode-select --install
~~~

Install or update lxml and Pygments.

~~~~
$ pip install pygments lxml --upgrade
~~~~

That'll spew a lot of console trash, but don't worry about it.

From here, you can follow the commons steps outlined below.

### Windows steps

Tested on Windows 7, 8/8.1 & 10

1. Install the latest [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/). Pick the 32bit version, even on 64bit Windows, as LXML only looks for the 32bit version.
2. Run the following in an elevated command prompt (change the path if your location is different)
~~~
setx /m PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts"
~~~
3. Install [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) by saving [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and just double clicking the file.
4. Install [LXML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.4.4) for your version of Python (it should be lxml-3.4.0win32-py2.7.exe)
5. Run `$ python -m pip install pygments`.

From here, you can follow the commons steps outlined below.

### Common steps

With the dependencies in place, you can now install the Bikeshed repository itself.  Run the following in your favorite command line:

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git
~~~~

(This’ll download bikeshed to a `bikeshed` folder, created wherever you’re currently at.  If you think you might want to commit back to Bikeshed, instead download it over SSH. I won’t explain how to do that here.)

Finally, run:

For Linux/OSX (Omit the `sudo` for OSX under Homebrew):

~~~~
$ sudo pip install --editable /path/to/cloned/bikeshed
$ bikeshed update
~~~~

On Windows:

~~~~
$ python -m pip install --editable /path/to/cloned/bikeshed
$ bikeshed update
~~~~

This’ll install Bikeshed, making it available to your Python environment as the `bikeshed` package,
automatically add a `bikeshed` command to your path,
and then update your data files to the latest versions.

To update bikeshed to its latest version at any time, just enter Bikeshed’s folder, and run:

~~~~
$ git pull --rebase
$ bikeshed update
~~~~

This’ll pull the latest version of Bikeshed, and ensure that you’re looking at the latest version of the data files, rather than whatever stale version is currently sitting in the repo.

See the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) for a quick run-through of how to actually use the processor, and the rest of the docs for more detailed information.

(If anything doesn’t work in here, let me know and I’ll fix it.  These instructions have worked for a lot of people on all OSes, but it's possible that you'll run into a new error, because computers are terrible.)
